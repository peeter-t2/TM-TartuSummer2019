16.747	Beau Lotto: So, this game is very simple.
18.916	All you have to do is read what you see. Right?
22.963	So, I'm going to count to you, so we don't all do it together.
26.164	Okay, one, two, three.Audience: Can you read this?
28.663	BL: Amazing. What about this one? One, two, three.Audience: You are not reading this.
33.042	BL: All right. One, two, three. (Laughter)
38.358	If you were Portuguese, right? How about this one? One, two, three.
43.155	Audience: What are you reading?
45.133	BL: What are you reading? There are no words there.
48.591	I said, read what you're seeing. Right?
51.128	"It literally says, ""Wat ar ou rea in?"" (Laughter) Right?"
54.978	That's what you should have said. Right? Why is this?
58.806	It's because perception is grounded in our experience.
62.342	Right? The brain takes meaningless information
65.239	and makes meaning out of it, which means we never see
68.198	what's there, we never see information,
70.454	we only ever see what was useful to see in the past.
73.729	All right? Which means, when it comes to perception,
76.465	we're all like this frog.
83.26	(Laughter)
84.172	Right? It's getting information. It's generating behavior
87.567	that's useful. (Laughter)
92.035	(Laughter)
99.067	(Video) Man: Ow! Ow! (Laughter) (Applause)
105.049	BL: And sometimes, when things don't go our way,
107.761	we get a little bit annoyed, right?
110.02	But we're talking about perception here, right?
112.75	And perception underpins everything we think, we know,
117.115	we believe, our hopes, our dreams, the clothes we wear,
119.986	falling in love, everything begins with perception.
123.729	Now if perception is grounded in our history, it means
126.674	we're only ever responding according to what we've done before.
130.133	But actually, it's a tremendous problem,
133.209	because how can we ever see differently?
136.826	Now, I want to tell you a story about seeing differently,
140.889	and all new perceptions begin in the same way.
144.877	They begin with a question.
147.459	The problem with questions is they create uncertainty.
150.697	Now, uncertainty is a very bad thing. It's evolutionarily
153.426	a bad thing. If you're not sure that's a predator, it's too late.
157.027	Okay? (Laughter)
158.387	Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty.
161.547	Right? If you go down below on a boat, your inner ears
163.799	are you telling you you're moving. Your eyes, because
165.975	it's moving in register with the boat, say I'm standing still.
168.291	Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information, and it gets ill.
172.946	"The question ""why?"" is one of the most dangerous things you can do,"
176.875	because it takes you into uncertainty.
179.867	And yet, the irony is, the only way we can ever
182.746	do anything new is to step into that space.
186.282	So how can we ever do anything new? Well fortunately,
189.506	evolution has given us an answer, right?
193.09	And it enables us to address even the most difficult
196.685	of questions. The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty.
201.364	They're the ones that question the things we think to be true already. Right?
205.32	It's easy to ask questions about how did life begin,
207.309	or what extends beyond the universe, but to question what you think to be true already
210.617	is really stepping into that space.
213.618	So what is evolution's answer to the problem of uncertainty?
218.428	It's play.
220.201	Now play is not simply a process. Experts in play will tell you
224.394	that actually it's a way of being.
227.009	Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty
229.9	is actually celebrated. Uncertainty is what makes play fun.
234.226	Right? It's adaptable to change. Right? It opens possibility,
238.501	and it's cooperative. It's actually how we do our social bonding,
242.61	and it's intrinsically motivated. What that means
244.336	is that we play to play. Play is its own reward.
248.942	Now if you look at these five ways of being,
252.833	these are the exact same ways of being you need
255.554	in order to be a good scientist.
257.59	Science is not defined by the method section of a paper.
260.617	It's actually a way of being, which is here, and this is true
263.757	for anything that is creative.
266.41	So if you add rules to play, you have a game.
270.613	That's actually what an experiment is.
273.403	So armed with these two ideas,
275.322	that science is a way of being and experiments are play,
279.644	we asked, can anyone become a scientist?
283.097	And who better to ask than 25 eight- to 10-year-old children?
286.597	Because they're experts in play. So I took my bee arena
290.104	down to a small school in Devon, and the aim of this
293.651	was to not just get the kids to see science differently,
297.895	but, through the process of science, to see themselves differently. Right?
302.493	The first step was to ask a question.
305.901	Now, I should say that we didn't get funding for this study
308.781	because the scientists said small children couldn't make
312.111	a useful contribution to science, and the teachers said kids couldn't do it.
316.413	So we did it anyway. Right? Of course.
320.147	So, here are some of the questions. I put them in small print
322.966	so you wouldn't bother reading it. Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with
327.406	were actually the basis of science publication the last five to 15 years. Right?
332.024	So they were asking questions that were significant
334.684	to expert scientists.
336.814	Now here, I want to share the stage with someone quite special. Right?
340.948	She was one of the young people who was involved in this study,
343.56	and she's now one of the youngest published scientists
345.894	in the world. Right? She will now, once she comes onto stage,
349.777	will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED. Right?
353.475	Now, science and asking questions is about courage.
356.35	Now she is the personification of courage, because she's
359.55	going to stand up here and talk to you all.
360.937	So Amy, would you please come up? (Applause)
366.191	(Applause)
373.376	So Amy's going to help me tell the story of what we call
375.895	the Blackawton Bees Project, and first she's going to tell you
378.561	the question that they came up with. So go ahead, Amy.
381.106	Amy O'Toole: Thank you, Beau. We thought
382.825	that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes
386.226	in the way that we think, because we look alike.
389.25	But we wondered if there's a possible link
391.939	with other animals. It'd be amazing if humans and bees
396.643	thought similar, since they seem so different from us.
400.756	So we asked if humans and bees might solve
403.809	complex problems in the same way.
406.216	Really, we wanted to know if bees can also adapt
409.503	themselves to new situations using previously learned rules
413.21	and conditions. So what if bees can think like us?
417.424	Well, it'd be amazing, since we're talking about an insect
419.976	with only one million brain cells.
422.501	But it actually makes a lot of sense they should,
424.643	because bees, like us, can recognize a good flower
427.92	regardless of the time of day, the light, the weather,
431.533	or from any angle they approach it from. (Applause)
437.275	BL: So the next step was to design an experiment,
441.057	which is a game. So the kids went off and they designed
444.359	this experiment, and so -- well, game -- and so,
447.66	Amy, can you tell us what the game was,
449.126	and the puzzle that you set the bees?
451.269	AO: The puzzle we came up with was an if-then rule.
454.292	We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color,
457.937	but to a certain color flower only
460.605	when it's in a certain pattern.
462.237	They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers
465.496	if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue,
468.556	or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow.
471.824	Now there's a number of different rules the bees can learn
474.409	to solve this puzzle. The interesting question is, which?
477.834	What was really exciting about this project was we,
480.614	and Beau, had no idea whether it would work.
482.957	It was completely new, and no one had done it before,
485.411	including adults. (Laughter)
489.134	BL: Including the teachers, and that was really hard for the teachers.
492.598	It's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he's doing,
495.502	because that's what we do in the lab, but for a teacher
498.046	not to know what's going to happen at the end of the day --
499.671	so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick, who was
502.27	the collaborator on this project. Okay?
504.479	So I'm not going to go through the whole details of the study
507.211	because actually you can read about it, but the next step
509.849	is observation. So here are some of the students
513.494	doing the observations. They're recording the data
516.262	of where the bees fly.
521.306	(Video) Dave Strudwick: So what we're going to do â€”Student: 5C.
523.329	Dave Strudwick: Is she still going up here?Student: Yeah.
527.319	Dave Strudwick: So you keep track of each.Student: Henry, can you help me here?
530.916	"BL: ""Can you help me, Henry?"" What good scientist says that, right?"
533.82	Student: There's two up there.
538.53	And three in here.
541.404	BL: Right? So we've got our observations. We've got our data.
543.679	They do the simple mathematics, averaging, etc., etc.
547.452	And now we want to share. That's the next step.
549.383	So we're going to write this up and try to submit this
550.991	for publication. Right? So we have to write it up.
553.847	So we go, of course, to the pub. All right? (Laughter)
558.36	The one on the left is mine, okay? (Laughter)
560.644	Now, I tell them, a paper has four different sections:
562.73	an introduction, a methods, a results, a discussion.
565.537	The introduction says, what's the question and why?
568.141	Methods, what did you do? Results, what was the observation?
571.26	And the discussion is, who cares? Right?
573.403	That's a science paper, basically. (Laughter)
575.862	So the kids give me the words, right? I put it into a narrative,
580.391	which means that this paper is written in kidspeak.
583.638	It's not written by me. It's written by Amy
586.166	and the other students in the class. As a consequence,
589.486	"this science paper begins, ""Once upon a time ... "" (Laughter)"
595.503	"The results section, it says: ""Training phase, the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh."" Right? (Laughter)"
600.815	"And the methods, it says, ""Then we put the bees"
603.011	"into the fridge (and made bee pie),"" smiley face. Right? (Laughter)"
606.328	This is a science paper. We're going to try to get it published.
610.161	So here's the title page. We have a number of authors there.
612.995	All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old.
615.846	The first author is Blackawton Primary School, because
617.896	"if it were ever referenced, it would be ""Blackawton et al,"""
621.142	and not one individual. So we submit it to a public access journal,
624.199	and it says this. It said many things, but it said this.
627.531	"""I'm afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways."" (Laughter)"
631.45	"In other words, it starts off ""once upon a time,"""
634.01	the figures are in crayon, etc. (Laughter)
636.536	So we said, we'll get it reviewed. So I sent it to Dale Purves,
640.889	who is at the National Academy of Science, one of the leading neuroscientists in the world,
644.422	"and he says, ""This is the most original science paper I have ever read"" â€” (Laughter) â€”"
647.871	"""and it certainly deserves wide exposure."""
649.968	"Larry Maloney, expert in vision, says, ""The paper is magnificent."
654.239	"The work would be publishable if done by adults."""
657.605	So what did we do? We send it back to the editor.
659.584	They say no.
661.173	So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write
663.627	a commentary situating the findings for scientists, right,
667.634	putting in the references, and we submit it to Biology Letters.
671.762	And there, it was reviewed by five independent referees,
675.089	and it was published. Okay? (Applause)
679.51	(Applause)
685.51	It took four months to do the science,
688.531	two years to get it published. (Laughter)
691.759	Typical science, actually, right? So this makes Amy and
696.594	her friends the youngest published scientists in the world.
699.027	What was the feedback like?
701.043	Well, it was published two days before Christmas,
703.928	downloaded 30,000 times in the first day, right?
707.931	It was the Editors' Choice in Science, which is a top science magazine.
711.971	It's forever freely accessible by Biology Letters.
714.513	It's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal.
718.193	Last year, it was the second-most downloaded paper
720.892	by Biology Letters, and the feedback from not just scientists
724.996	and teachers but the public as well.
727.544	And I'll just read one.
729.316	"""I have read 'Blackawton Bees' recently. I don't have"
731.806	words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now.
734.119	What you guys have done is real, true and amazing.
736.598	Curiosity, interest, innocence and zeal are the most basic
739.707	and most important things to do science.
741.431	Who else can have these qualities more than children?
743.909	"Please congratulate your children's team from my side."""
747.45	So I'd like to conclude with a physical metaphor.
750.833	Can I do it on you? (Laughter)
753.801	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, come on. Yeah yeah. Okay.
756.894	Now, science is about taking risks, so this is an incredible risk, right? (Laughter)
762.071	For me, not for him. Right? Because we've only done this once before. (Laughter)
768.169	And you like technology, right?
769.745	Shimon Schocken: Right, but I like myself.
771.921	BL: This is the epitome of technology. Right. Okay.
774.872	Now ... (Laughter)
778.48	Okay. (Laughter)
781.36	Now, we're going to do a little demonstration, right?
785.444	You have to close your eyes, and you have to point
789.463	where you hear me clapping. All right?
792.62	(Clapping)
797.018	(Clapping)
800.162	Okay, how about if everyone over there shouts. One, two, three?
803.065	Audience: (Shouts)
805.966	(Laughter)
810.412	(Shouts) (Laughter)
813.583	Brilliant. Now, open your eyes. We'll do it one more time.
817.224	Everyone over there shout. (Shouts)
820.026	Where's the sound coming from? (Laughter) (Applause)
825.958	Thank you very much. (Applause)
830.188	What's the point? The point is what science does for us.
833.901	Right? We normally walk through life responding,
836.307	but if we ever want to do anything different, we have to
838.519	step into uncertainty. When he opened his eyes,
841.208	he was able to see the world in a new way.
843.59	That's what science offers us. It offers the possibility
846.758	to step on uncertainty through the process of play, right?
850.774	Now, true science education I think should be about
853.798	giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice,
857.197	so I've asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story.
861.566	So, Amy?
864.671	AO: This project was really exciting for me,
867.224	because it brought the process of discovery to life,
869.895	and it showed me that anyone, and I mean anyone,
872.806	has the potential to discover something new,
875.559	and that a small question can lead into a big discovery.
879.631	Changing the way a person thinks about something
882.283	can be easy or hard. It all depends on the way the person
885.995	feels about change.
887.483	But changing the way I thought about science was
889.935	surprisingly easy. Once we played the games
892.21	and then started to think about the puzzle,
894.628	I then realized that science isn't just a boring subject,
898.485	and that anyone can discover something new.
901.679	You just need an opportunity. My opportunity came
904.879	in the form of Beau, and the Blackawton Bee Project.
907.515	Thank you.BL: Thank you very much. (Applause)
911.876	(Applause)
