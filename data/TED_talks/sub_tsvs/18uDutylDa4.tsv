16.26	So for any of us in this room today,
16.26	let's start out by admitting we're lucky.
20.625	We don't live in the world
20.625	our mothers lived in,
23.476	our grandmothers lived in,
24.739	where career choices
24.739	for women were so limited.
27.628	And if you're in this room today,
29.26	most of us grew up in a world
29.26	where we have basic civil rights,
34.028	and amazingly, we still live in a world
34.028	where some women don't have them.
38.641	But all that aside,
38.641	we still have a problem,
41.37	and it's a real problem.
42.609	And the problem is this:
44.26	Women are not making it
44.26	to the top of any profession
48.456	anywhere in the world.
50.354	The numbers tell the story quite clearly.
	nine are women.
56.26	Of all the people
56.26	in parliament in the world,
61.058	In the corporate sector, women at the top,
63.926	C-level jobs, board seats --
66.26	tops out at 15, 16 percent.
69.025	The numbers have not moved since 2002
72.001	and are going in the wrong direction.
74.472	And even in the non-profit world,
76.628	a world we sometimes think of
76.628	as being led by more women,
79.924	women at the top: 20 percent.
83.282	We also have another problem,
84.724	which is that women face harder choices
87.138	between professional success
87.138	and personal fulfillment.
90.735	A recent study in the U.S.
90.735	showed that, of married senior managers,
95.805	two-thirds of the married men had children
98.26	and only one-third
98.26	of the married women had children.
101.929	A couple of years ago, I was in New York,
103.963	and I was pitching a deal,
105.443	and I was in one of those fancy
105.443	New York private equity offices
108.818	you can picture.
110.015	And I'm in the meeting --
110.015	it's about a three-hour meeting --
112.849	and two hours in,
112.849	there needs to be that bio break,
116.032	and everyone stands up,
117.863	and the partner running the meeting
117.863	starts looking really embarrassed.
121.521	And I realized he doesn't know
121.521	where the women's room is in his office.
125.818	So I start looking
125.818	around for moving boxes,
128.385	figuring they just moved in,
128.385	but I don't see any.
130.695	"And so I said, ""Did you just"
130.695	"move into this office?"""
134.02	"And he said, ""No,"
134.02	"we've been here about a year."""
136.889	"And I said, ""Are you telling me"
136.889	that I am the only woman
141.014	to have pitched a deal
141.014	"in this office in a year?"""
144.26	And he looked at me, and he said,
145.87	"""Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one"
145.87	"who had to go to the bathroom."""
149.475	(Laughter)
151.898	So the question is,
151.898	how are we going to fix this?
156.867	How do we change these numbers at the top?
160.143	How do we make this different?
162.879	I want to start out by saying,
162.879	I talk about this --
165.54	about keeping women in the workforce --
168.26	because I really think that's the answer.
170.873	In the high-income part of our workforce,
173.159	in the people who end up at the top --
175.26	Fortune 500 CEO jobs,
175.26	or the equivalent in other industries --
180.26	the problem, I am convinced,
180.26	is that women are dropping out.
183.931	Now people talk about this a lot,
186.26	and they talk about things
186.26	like flextime and mentoring
189.298	and programs companies
189.298	should have to train women.
191.807	I want to talk about none of that today,
193.736	even though that's all really important.
195.762	Today I want to focus
195.762	on what we can do as individuals.
198.955	What are the messages
198.955	we need to tell ourselves?
201.26	What are the messages we tell
201.26	the women that work with and for us?
204.448	What are the messages
204.448	we tell our daughters?
206.901	Now, at the outset,
206.901	I want to be very clear
209.324	that this speech comes with no judgments.
211.43	I don't have the right answer.
213.034	I don't even have it for myself.
215.26	I left San Francisco,
215.26	where I live, on Monday,
218.26	and I was getting on the plane
218.26	for this conference.
221.05	And my daughter, who's three,
221.05	when I dropped her off at preschool,
224.17	did that whole hugging-the-leg, crying,
224.17	"""Mommy, don't get on the plane"" thing."
227.861	This is hard. I feel guilty sometimes.
230.707	I know no women,
232.26	whether they're at home
232.26	or whether they're in the workforce,
235.094	who don't feel that sometimes.
236.657	So I'm not saying
236.657	that staying in the workforce
239.26	is the right thing for everyone.
241.588	My talk today is about
241.588	what the messages are
244.26	if you do want to stay in the workforce,
246.641	and I think there are three.
248.775	One, sit at the table.
251.164	Two, make your partner a real partner.
254.466	And three, don't leave before you leave.
259.056	Number one: sit at the table.
261.114	Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook,
262.963	we hosted a very senior
262.963	government official,
265.26	and he came in to meet with senior execs
268.505	from around Silicon Valley.
270.614	And everyone kind of sat at the table.
272.82	He had these two women
272.82	who were traveling with him
275.416	pretty senior in his department,
277.26	and I kind of said to them,
278.57	"""Sit at the table."
278.57	"Come on, sit at the table,"""
280.808	and they sat on the side of the room.
283.793	When I was in college, my senior year,
285.769	I took a course called
285.769	European Intellectual History.
288.292	Don't you love that kind
288.292	of thing from college?
290.523	I wish I could do that now.
292.26	And I took it with my roommate, Carrie,
294.26	who was then a brilliant
294.26	literary student --
296.824	and went on to be a brilliant
296.824	literary scholar --
299.158	and my brother -- smart guy,
301.199	but a water-polo-playing pre-med,
302.838	who was a sophomore.
304.26	The three of us take this class together.
306.818	And then Carrie reads all the books
306.818	in the original Greek and Latin,
311.018	goes to all the lectures.
312.734	I read all the books in English
314.808	and go to most of the lectures.
316.489	My brother is kind of busy.
318.26	He reads one book of 12
318.26	and goes to a couple of lectures,
321.996	marches himself up to our room
325.067	a couple days before the exam
325.067	to get himself tutored.
328.117	The three of us go to the exam
328.117	together, and we sit down.
330.822	And we sit there for three hours --
333.005	and our little blue notebooks
333.005	-- yes, I'm that old.
335.41	We walk out, we look at each other,
335.41	"and we say, ""How did you do?"""
338.649	"And Carrie says, ""Boy, I feel like"
338.649	I didn't really draw out the main point
342.15	"on the Hegelian dialectic."""
343.749	"And I say, ""God, I really"
343.749	wish I had really connected
346.698	John Locke's theory of property
346.698	"with the philosophers that follow."""
349.937	And my brother says,
351.465	"""I got the top grade in the class."""
353.404	(Laughter)
355.373	"""You got the top grade in the class?"
357.493	"You don't know anything."""
359.067	(Laughter)
360.491	The problem with these stories
360.491	is that they show what the data shows:
365.063	women systematically
365.063	underestimate their own abilities.
368.577	If you test men and women,
370.26	and you ask them questions
370.26	on totally objective criteria like GPAs,
373.878	men get it wrong slightly high,
375.766	and women get it wrong slightly low.
378.26	Women do not negotiate
378.26	for themselves in the workforce.
381.26	A study in the last two years
383.26	of people entering
383.26	the workforce out of college
385.901	showed that 57 percent
385.901	of boys entering, or men, I guess,
390.26	are negotiating their first salary,
392.685	and only seven percent of women.
395.397	And most importantly,
397.54	men attribute their success to themselves,
400.26	and women attribute it
400.26	to other external factors.
403.26	If you ask men why they did a good job,
405.657	"they'll say, ""I'm awesome."
408.26	"Obviously. Why are you even asking?"""
411.26	If you ask women why they did a good job,
413.26	what they'll say is someone helped them,
415.26	they got lucky, they worked really hard.
417.906	Why does this matter?
419.26	Boy, it matters a lot.
421.26	Because no one gets to the corner office
424.26	by sitting on the side, not at the table,
426.838	and no one gets the promotion
428.865	if they don't think
428.865	they deserve their success,
431.444	or they don't even understand
431.444	their own success.
435.112	I wish the answer were easy.
436.9	I wish I could go tell
436.9	all the young women I work for,
439.536	these fabulous women,
440.574	"""Believe in yourself"
440.574	and negotiate for yourself.
442.848	"Own your own success."""
444.626	I wish I could tell that to my daughter.
447.26	But it's not that simple.
449.172	Because what the data shows,
449.172	above all else, is one thing,
452.764	which is that success and likeability
452.764	are positively correlated for men
457.089	and negatively correlated for women.
459.881	And everyone's nodding,
459.881	because we all know this to be true.
463.472	There's a really good study
463.472	that shows this really well.
466.26	There's a famous Harvard
466.26	Business School study
468.475	on a woman named Heidi Roizen.
470.132	And she's an operator
470.132	in a company in Silicon Valley,
474.56	and she uses her contacts
476.26	to become a very successful
476.26	venture capitalist.
479.26	In 2002 -- not so long ago --
481.26	a professor who was then
481.26	at Columbia University
483.523	took that case
483.523	and made it [Howard] Roizen.
486.26	And he gave the case out, both of them,
486.26	to two groups of students.
489.787	He changed exactly one word:
492.743	"""Heidi"" to ""Howard."""
494.26	But that one word made
494.26	a really big difference.
497.807	He then surveyed the students,
499.462	and the good news was the students,
499.462	both men and women,
502.152	thought Heidi and Howard
502.152	were equally competent,
504.57	and that's good.
506.26	The bad news was
506.26	that everyone liked Howard.
508.967	He's a great guy.
508.967	You want to work for him.
510.991	You want to spend the day
510.991	fishing with him.
513.015	But Heidi? Not so sure.
514.601	She's a little out for herself.
514.601	She's a little political.
517.49	You're not sure
517.49	you'd want to work for her.
520.26	This is the complication.
522.26	We have to tell our daughters
522.26	and our colleagues,
524.594	we have to tell ourselves
524.594	to believe we got the A,
527.302	to reach for the promotion,
527.302	to sit at the table,
530.26	and we have to do it in a world
532.063	where, for them, there are sacrifices
532.063	they will make for that,
535.682	even though for their brothers,
535.682	there are not.
539.077	The saddest thing about all of this
539.077	is that it's really hard to remember this.
542.768	And I'm about to tell a story
542.768	which is truly embarrassing for me,
545.84	but I think important.
547.53	I gave this talk at Facebook
547.53	not so long ago
550.751	to about 100 employees,
553.264	and a couple hours later,
553.264	there was a young woman who works there
556.336	sitting outside my little desk,
556.336	and she wanted to talk to me.
559.699	I said, okay, and she sat down,
559.699	and we talked.
561.866	"And she said, ""I learned something today."
563.843	"I learned that I need to keep my hand up."""
566.239	"""What do you mean?"""
567.295	"She said, ""You're giving this talk,"
569.113	and you said you would take
569.113	two more questions.
571.434	I had my hand up with many other people,
573.538	and you took two more questions.
575.157	I put my hand down, and I noticed
575.157	all the women did the same,
578.091	and then you took more questions,
580.044	"only from the men."""
582.416	And I thought to myself,
583.731	"""Wow, if it's me -- who cares"
583.731	about this, obviously --
586.56	giving this talk --
588.518	and during this talk, I can't even notice
588.518	that the men's hands are still raised,
594.26	and the women's hands are still raised,
596.26	how good are we
597.462	as managers of our companies
597.462	and our organizations
600.19	at seeing that the men
600.19	are reaching for opportunities
602.739	"more than women?"""
604.537	We've got to get women
604.537	to sit at the table.
606.951	(Cheers)
607.976	(Applause)
611.208	Message number two:
612.555	Make your partner a real partner.
614.466	I've become convinced that we've made
614.466	more progress in the workforce
617.681	than we have in the home.
619.26	The data shows this very clearly.
622.26	If a woman and a man
622.26	work full-time and have a child,
626.463	the woman does twice the amount
626.463	of housework the man does,
629.84	and the woman does three times
629.84	the amount of childcare the man does.
634.707	So she's got three jobs
634.707	or two jobs, and he's got one.
638.481	Who do you think drops out
638.481	when someone needs to be home more?
642.074	The causes of this are really complicated,
642.074	and I don't have time to go into them.
645.908	And I don't think Sunday football-watching
645.908	and general laziness is the cause.
649.868	I think the cause is more complicated.
652.106	I think, as a society,
653.619	we put more pressure
653.619	on our boys to succeed
655.86	than we do on our girls.
657.714	I know men that stay home
659.766	and work in the home
659.766	to support wives with careers,
662.857	and it's hard.
663.908	When I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuff
663.908	and I see the father there,
667.26	I notice that the other mommies
667.26	don't play with him.
671.26	And that's a problem,
673.26	because we have to make it
673.26	as important a job,
676.47	because it's the hardest job
676.47	in the world to work inside the home,
679.873	for people of both genders,
681.377	if we're going to even things out and let
681.377	women stay in the workforce.
684.895	(Applause)
686.26	Studies show that households
686.26	with equal earning
688.523	and equal responsibility
690.489	also have half the divorce rate.
692.674	And if that wasn't good enough motivation
692.674	for everyone out there,
695.882	they also have more --
697.719	how shall I say this on this stage?
699.553	They know each other more
699.553	in the biblical sense as well.
702.26	(Cheers)
704.777	Message number three:
706.736	Don't leave before you leave.
708.799	I think there's a really deep irony
710.566	to the fact that actions
710.566	women are taking --
712.675	and I see this all the time --
714.26	with the objective
714.26	of staying in the workforce
717.41	actually lead to their eventually leaving.
719.999	Here's what happens:
721.26	We're all busy. Everyone's busy.
721.26	A woman's busy.
723.828	And she starts thinking
723.828	about having a child,
726.26	and from the moment she starts
726.26	thinking about having a child,
729.26	she starts thinking
729.26	about making room for that child.
732.257	"""How am I going to fit this"
732.257	"into everything else I'm doing?"""
735.442	And literally from that moment,
738.116	she doesn't raise her hand anymore,
740.434	she doesn't look for a promotion,
740.434	she doesn't take on the new project,
743.788	"she doesn't say, ""Me. I want to do that."""
745.789	She starts leaning back.
747.462	The problem is that --
748.883	let's say she got pregnant
748.883	that day, that day --
752.471	nine months of pregnancy,
752.471	three months of maternity leave,
755.26	six months to catch your breath --
757.434	Fast-forward two years,
758.92	more often -- and as I've seen it --
760.904	women start thinking
760.904	about this way earlier --
763.442	when they get engaged, or married,
765.356	when they start thinking
765.356	about having a child,
767.528	which can take a long time.
769.019	One woman came to see me about this.
771.051	She looked a little young.
772.804	"And I said, ""So are you and your husband"
772.804	"thinking about having a baby?"""
776.162	"And she said, ""Oh no, I'm not married."""
778.148	She didn't even have a boyfriend.
779.747	(Laughter)
780.772	"I said, ""You're thinking about this"
780.772	"just way too early."""
784.479	But the point is that what happens
787.121	once you start
787.121	kind of quietly leaning back?
790.803	Everyone who's been through this --
792.593	and I'm here to tell you,
792.593	once you have a child at home,
795.36	your job better be really good to go back,
797.97	because it's hard to leave
797.97	that kid at home.
800.137	Your job needs to be challenging.
802.025	It needs to be rewarding.
803.715	You need to feel like you're
803.715	making a difference.
806.26	And if two years ago
806.26	you didn't take a promotion
809.26	and some guy next to you did,
811.55	if three years ago you stopped
811.55	looking for new opportunities,
815.26	you're going to be bored
817.012	because you should have kept
817.012	your foot on the gas pedal.
820.472	Don't leave before you leave.
822.891	Stay in.
824.26	Keep your foot on the gas pedal,
826.26	until the very day you need to leave
826.26	to take a break for a child --
830.915	and then make your decisions.
833.156	Don't make decisions too far in advance,
835.658	particularly ones you're not
835.658	even conscious you're making.
839.771	My generation really, sadly,
841.536	is not going to change
841.536	the numbers at the top.
843.831	They're just not moving.
845.575	We are not going to get
845.575	to where 50 percent of the population --
848.801	in my generation, there will not
848.801	be 50 percent of [women]
851.492	at the top of any industry.
854.13	But I'm hopeful that future
854.13	generations can.
857.544	I think a world where half
857.544	of our countries and our companies
862.257	were run by women,
862.257	would be a better world.
864.694	It's not just because people would know
864.694	where the women's bathrooms are,
868.099	even though that would be very helpful.
870.776	I think it would be a better world.
873.503	I have two children.
874.802	I have a five-year-old son
874.802	and a two-year-old daughter.
877.82	I want my son to have a choice
879.521	to contribute fully
879.521	in the workforce or at home,
882.617	and I want my daughter
882.617	to have the choice to not just succeed,
886.537	but to be liked for her accomplishments.
889.26	Thank you.
