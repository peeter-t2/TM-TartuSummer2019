12.553	An image is worth more than a thousand words,
16.395	so I'm going to start my talk
18.522	by stop talking and show you a few images
21.19	that I recently captured.
42.712	So by now, my talk is already 6,000 words long,
46.742	and I feel like I should stop here.
48.89	(Laughter)
51.31	At the same time, I probably owe you
53.131	some explanation
54.137	about the images that you just saw.
57.24	What I am trying to do as a photographer,
59.963	as an artist, is to bring the world
62.446	of art and science together.
65.823	Whether it is an image of a soap bubble
68.162	captured at the very moment where it's bursting,
70.928	as you can see in this image,
73.4	whether it's a universe made of tiny little beads
76.008	of oil paint,
78.506	strange liquids that behave in very peculiar ways,
82.849	or paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces,
87.115	I'm always trying to link those two fields together.
91.081	What I find very intriguing about those two
93.471	is that they both look at the same thing:
96.75	They are a response to their surroundings.
99.574	And yet, they do it in a very different way.
103.467	If you look at science on one hand,
105.514	science is a very rational approach
108.937	to its surroundings,
110.418	whereas art on the other hand
112.507	is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings.
116.81	What I am trying to do is I'm trying
118.827	to bring those two views into one
121.468	so that my images both speak to the viewer's heart
125.418	but also to the viewer's brain.
128.612	Let me demonstrate this based on three projects.
133.278	The first one has to do with making sound visible.
138.332	Now as you may know,
139.35	sound travels in waves,
141.976	so if you have a speaker,
144.299	a speaker actually does nothing else
146.348	than taking the audio signal,
148.232	transform it into a vibration,
151.829	which is then transported through the air,
154.53	is captured by our ear,
156.392	and transformed into an audio signal again.
159.933	Now I was thinking,
161.779	how can I make those sound waves visible?
165.999	So I came up with the following setup.
168.115	I took a speaker, I placed a thin foil
171.835	of plastic on top of that speaker,
174.07	and then I added tiny little crystals
176.737	on top of that speaker.
178.714	And now, if I would play a sound through that speaker,
181.614	it would cause the crystals to move up and down.
185.496	Now this happens very fast,
187.795	in the blink of an eye,
189.747	so, together with LG, we captured this motion
193.434	with a camera that is able
195.12	to capture more than 3,000 frames per second.
198.595	Let me show you what this looks like.
202.068	"(Music: ""Teardrop"" by Massive Attack)"
243.406	(Applause)
248.724	Thank you very much.
249.987	I agree, it looks pretty amazing.
253.231	But I have to tell you a funny story.
255.59	I got an indoor sunburn doing this
258.104	while shooting in Los Angeles.
260.152	Now in Los Angeles, you could get a decent sunburn
262.427	just on any of the beaches,
264.153	but I got mine indoors,
266.223	and what happened is that,
267.932	if you're shooting at 3,000 frames per second,
270.753	you need to have a silly amount of light, lots of lights.
275.242	So we had this speaker set up,
277.771	and we had the camera facing it,
279.37	and lots of lights pointing at the speaker,
282.756	and I would set up the speaker,
284.111	put the tiny little crystals on top of that speaker,
287.157	and we would do this over and over again,
289.978	and it was until midday that I realized
292.739	that I had a completely red face
295.076	because of the lights pointing at the speaker.
298.162	What was so funny about it was that
300.468	the speaker was only coming from the right side,
303.195	so the right side of my face was completely red
306.562	and I looked like the Phantom of the Opera
308.404	for the rest of the week.
311.246	Let me now turn to another project
313.349	which involves less harmful substances.
319.852	Has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid?
323.492	Ah, some of you have. Excellent.
326.014	Should I skip that part?
327.891	(Laughter)
329.473	Ferrofluid has a very strange behavior.
332.736	It's a liquid that is completely black.
334.988	It's got an oily consistency.
337.482	And it's got tiny little particles of metal in it,
340.942	which makes it magnetic.
343.081	So if I now put this liquid into a magnetic field,
346.634	it would change its appearance.
349.427	Now I've got a live demonstration over here
353.222	to show this to you.
359.533	So I've got a camera pointing down at this plate,
362.486	and underneath that plate, there is a magnet.
366.014	Now I'm going to add some of that ferrofluid
369.006	to that magnet.
377.609	Let's just slightly move it to the right
385.33	and maybe focus it a little bit more. Excellent.
390.088	So what you can see now is that
392.281	the ferrofluid has formed spikes.
394.678	This is due to the attraction and the repulsion
398.031	of the individual particles inside the liquid.
401.74	Now this looks already quite interesting,
403.983	but let me now add some watercolors to it.
407.537	Those are just standard watercolors
409.991	that you would paint with.
411.622	You wouldn't paint with syringes,
412.965	but it works just the same.
430.798	So what happened now is,
432.91	when the watercolor was flowing into the structure,
436.154	the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid.
439.505	That's because the ferrofluid itself
441.841	is hydrophobic.
444.024	That means it doesn't mix with the water.
446.187	And at the same time, it tries to maintain its position
449.196	above the magnet,
450.561	and therefore, it creates those amazing-looking
453.956	structures of channels and tiny little ponds
457.289	of colorful water paint.
459.869	So that was the second project.
461.62	Let me now turn to the last project,
463.972	which involves
468.744	the national beverage of Scotland.
470.834	(Laughter)
473.154	This image, and also this one,
477.074	were made using whiskey.
480.345	Now you might ask yourself,
481.835	how did he do that?
482.863	Did he drink half a bottle of whiskey
484.712	and then draw the hallucination he got
487.423	from being drunk onto paper?
491.037	I can assure you I was fully conscious
493.281	while I was taking those pictures.
496.391	Now, whiskey contains 40 percent of alcohol,
500.493	and alcohol has got some very interesting properties.
504.729	Maybe you have experienced
506.42	some of those properties before,
508.546	but I am talking about the physical properties,
511.265	not the other ones.
513.5	So when I open the bottle, the alcohol molecules
517.7	would spread in the air,
519.043	and that's because alcohol is a very volatile substance.
523.123	And at the same time, alcohol is highly flammable.
527.81	And it was with those two properties
529.959	that I was able to create the images
532.564	that you're seeing right now.
534.594	Let me demonstrate this over here.
544.709	And what I have here is an empty glass vessel.
548.027	It's got nothing in it.
549.336	And now I'm going to fill it with oxygen
553.144	and whiskey.
571.962	Add some more.
578.171	Now we just wait for a few seconds
580.186	for the molecules to spread inside the bottle.
583.233	And now, let's set that on fire.
585.63	(Laughter)
603.74	So that's all that happens.
605.278	It goes really fast, and it's not that impressive.
608.477	I could do it again to show it one more time,
611.083	but some would argue that this is a complete waste
613.814	of the whiskey, and that I should rather drink it.
617.666	But let me show you a slow motion
619.754	in a completely darkened room
621.449	of what I just showed you in this live demonstration.
633.605	So what happened is that the flame
636.338	traveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom,
640.33	burning the mix of the air molecules
643.379	and the alcohol.
645.208	So the images that you saw at the beginning,
648.024	they are actually a flame stopped in time
652.368	while it is traveling through the bottle,
654.846	and you have to imagine
656.064	it was flipped around 180 degrees.
659.53	So that's how those images were made.
661.968	(Applause)
666.324	Thank you.
669.097	So, I have now showed you three projects,
672.18	and you might ask yourself, what is it good for?
674.832	What's the idea behind it?
676.423	Is it just a waste of whiskey?
677.756	Is it just some strange materials?
681.981	Those three projects, they're based on very simple
684.794	scientific phenomena,
686.456	such as magnetism, the sound waves,
689.197	or over here, the physical properties of a substance,
693.239	and what I'm trying to do
695.151	is I'm trying to use these phenomena
698.3	and show them in a poetic and unseen way,
701.417	and therefore invite the viewer
703.836	to pause for a moment
705.736	and think about all the beauty
708.451	that is constantly surrounding us.
712.394	Thank you very much.
713.823	(Applause)
