13.006	We have historical records that allow us
13.006	to know how the ancient Greeks dressed,
18.18	how they lived,
19.458	how they fought ...
21.004	but how did they think?
23.432	One natural idea is that the deepest
23.432	aspects of human thought --
27.896	our ability to imagine,
29.792	to be conscious,
31.213	to dream --
32.468	have always been the same.
34.872	Another possibility
36.395	is that the social transformations
36.395	that have shaped our culture
40.142	may have also changed
40.142	the structural columns of human thought.
44.911	We may all have different
44.911	opinions about this.
47.459	Actually, it's a long-standing
47.459	philosophical debate.
50.644	But is this question
50.644	even amenable to science?
54.834	Here I'd like to propose
57.364	that in the same way we can reconstruct
57.364	how the ancient Greek cities looked
62.16	just based on a few bricks,
64.572	that the writings of a culture
64.572	are the archaeological records,
68.722	the fossils, of human thought.
71.905	And in fact,
73.103	doing some form of psychological analysis
75.333	of some of the most ancient
75.333	books of human culture,
78.901	Julian Jaynes came up in the '70s
78.901	with a very wild and radical hypothesis:
84.88	that only 3,000 years ago,
87.317	humans were what today
87.317	we would call schizophrenics.
93.753	And he made this claim
95.285	based on the fact that the first
95.285	humans described in these books
98.61	behaved consistently,
100.538	in different traditions
100.538	and in different places of the world,
103.578	as if they were hearing and obeying voices
107.134	that they perceived
107.134	as coming from the Gods,
110.198	or from the muses ...
112.063	what today we would call hallucinations.
115.888	And only then, as time went on,
118.538	they began to recognize
118.538	that they were the creators,
122.213	the owners of these inner voices.
125.316	And with this, they gained introspection:
128.055	the ability to think
128.055	about their own thoughts.
131.785	So Jaynes's theory is that consciousness,
135.206	at least in the way we perceive it today,
138.396	where we feel that we are the pilots
138.396	of our own existence --
141.96	is a quite recent cultural development.
145.456	And this theory is quite spectacular,
147.266	but it has an obvious problem
148.723	which is that it's built on just a few
148.723	and very specific examples.
153.085	So the question is whether the theory
154.872	that introspection built up in human
154.872	history only about 3,000 years ago
159.647	can be examined in a quantitative
159.647	and objective manner.
163.543	And the problem of how
163.543	to go about this is quite obvious.
167.13	It's not like Plato woke up one day
167.13	and then he wrote,
170.614	"""Hello, I'm Plato,"
172.297	and as of today, I have
172.297	"a fully introspective consciousness."""
175.21	(Laughter)
177.527	And this tells us actually
177.527	what is the essence of the problem.
181.467	We need to find the emergence
181.467	of a concept that's never said.
186.434	The word introspection
186.434	does not appear a single time
190.768	in the books we want to analyze.
193.728	So our way to solve this
193.728	is to build the space of words.
198.571	This is a huge space
198.571	that contains all words
201.882	in such a way that the distance
201.882	between any two of them
204.708	is indicative of how
204.708	closely related they are.
208.46	So for instance,
209.635	"you want the words ""dog"" and ""cat"""
209.635	to be very close together,
212.556	"but the words ""grapefruit"" and ""logarithm"""
212.556	to be very far away.
216.809	And this has to be true
216.809	for any two words within the space.
221.626	And there are different ways
221.626	that we can construct the space of words.
224.991	One is just asking the experts,
226.658	a bit like we do with dictionaries.
228.896	Another possibility
230.348	is following the simple assumption
230.348	that when two words are related,
234.087	they tend to appear in the same sentences,
236.46	in the same paragraphs,
237.937	in the same documents,
239.731	more often than would be expected
239.731	just by pure chance.
244.231	And this simple hypothesis,
246.305	this simple method,
247.635	with some computational tricks
249.266	that have to do with the fact
250.679	that this is a very complex
250.679	and high-dimensional space,
253.767	turns out to be quite effective.
256.155	And just to give you a flavor
256.155	of how well this works,
258.981	this is the result we get when
258.981	we analyze this for some familiar words.
263.607	And you can see first
264.816	that words automatically organize
264.816	into semantic neighborhoods.
268.118	So you get the fruits, the body parts,
270.359	the computer parts,
270.359	the scientific terms and so on.
273.119	The algorithm also identifies
273.119	that we organize concepts in a hierarchy.
277.852	So for instance,
279.027	you can see that the scientific terms
279.027	break down into two subcategories
282.648	of the astronomic and the physics terms.
285.338	And then there are very fine things.
287.608	For instance, the word astronomy,
289.537	which seems a bit bizarre where it is,
291.376	is actually exactly where it should be,
293.448	between what it is,
295.067	an actual science,
296.361	and between what it describes,
297.921	the astronomical terms.
300.182	And we could go on and on with this.
302.097	Actually, if you stare
302.097	at this for a while,
304.181	and you just build random trajectories,
306.063	you will see that it actually feels
306.063	a bit like doing poetry.
310.018	And this is because, in a way,
311.924	walking in this space
311.924	is like walking in the mind.
316.027	And the last thing
317.668	is that this algorithm also identifies
317.668	what are our intuitions,
321.732	of which words should lead
321.732	in the neighborhood of introspection.
325.652	So for instance,
326.899	"words such as ""self,"" ""guilt,"""
326.899	"""reason,"" ""emotion,"""
330.902	"are very close to ""introspection,"""
332.815	but other words,
333.99	"such as ""red,"" ""football,"""
333.99	"""candle,"" ""banana,"""
336.181	are just very far away.
338.054	And so once we've built the space,
340.84	the question of the history
340.84	of introspection,
343.69	or of the history of any concept
346.047	which before could seem abstract
346.047	and somehow vague,
350.85	becomes concrete --
352.478	becomes amenable to quantitative science.
356.216	All that we have to do is take the books,
359.002	we digitize them,
360.407	and we take this stream
360.407	of words as a trajectory
363.24	and project them into the space,
365.233	and then we ask whether this trajectory
365.233	spends significant time
369.011	circling closely to the concept
369.011	of introspection.
372.76	And with this,
373.98	we could analyze
373.98	the history of introspection
376.116	in the ancient Greek tradition,
378.061	for which we have the best
378.061	available written record.
381.631	So what we did is we took all the books --
383.91	we just ordered them by time --
386.218	for each book we take the words
387.994	and we project them to the space,
389.979	and then we ask for each word
389.979	how close it is to introspection,
393.035	and we just average that.
394.59	And then we ask whether,
394.59	as time goes on and on,
397.812	these books get closer,
397.812	and closer and closer
401.088	to the concept of introspection.
402.866	And this is exactly what happens
402.866	in the ancient Greek tradition.
407.698	So you can see that for the oldest books
407.698	in the Homeric tradition,
410.849	there is a small increase with books
410.849	getting closer to introspection.
414.285	But about four centuries before Christ,
416.515	this starts ramping up very rapidly
416.515	to an almost five-fold increase
421.247	of books getting closer,
421.247	and closer and closer
423.771	to the concept of introspection.
426.159	And one of the nice things about this
428.607	is that now we can ask
429.829	whether this is also true
429.829	in a different, independent tradition.
434.962	So we just ran this same analysis
434.962	on the Judeo-Christian tradition,
438.162	and we got virtually the same pattern.
441.548	Again, you see a small increase
441.548	for the oldest books in the Old Testament,
446.207	and then it increases much more rapidly
448.145	in the new books of the New Testament.
450.008	And then we get the peak of introspection
452.064	"in ""The Confessions of Saint Augustine,"""
454.215	about four centuries after Christ.
456.897	And this was very important,
458.865	because Saint Augustine
458.865	had been recognized by scholars,
462.262	philologists, historians,
464.458	as one of the founders of introspection.
467.06	Actually, some believe him to be
467.06	the father of modern psychology.
471.012	So our algorithm,
472.875	which has the virtue
472.875	of being quantitative,
475.741	of being objective,
477.028	and of course of being extremely fast --
479.068	it just runs in a fraction of a second --
481.489	can capture some of the most
481.489	important conclusions
485.016	of this long tradition of investigation.
488.317	And this is in a way
488.317	one of the beauties of science,
491.992	which is that now this idea
491.992	can be translated
495.492	and generalized to a whole lot
495.492	of different domains.
498.769	So in the same way that we asked
498.769	about the past of human consciousness,
503.56	maybe the most challenging question
503.56	we can pose to ourselves
506.99	is whether this can tell us something
506.99	about the future of our own consciousness.
511.55	To put it more precisely,
513.044	whether the words we say today
515.484	can tell us something
515.484	of where our minds will be in a few days,
520.705	in a few months
521.88	or a few years from now.
523.597	And in the same way many of us
523.597	are now wearing sensors
526.641	that detect our heart rate,
528.451	our respiration,
529.744	our genes,
531.435	on the hopes that this may
531.435	help us prevent diseases,
535.11	we can ask whether monitoring
535.11	and analyzing the words we speak,
538.655	we tweet, we email, we write,
541.362	can tell us ahead of time whether
541.362	something may go wrong with our minds.
547.087	And with Guillermo Cecchi,
548.645	who has been my brother in this adventure,
551.67	we took on this task.
554.228	And we did so by analyzing
554.228	the recorded speech of 34 young people
559.784	who were at a high risk
559.784	of developing schizophrenia.
563.434	And so what we did is,
563.434	we measured speech at day one,
566.339	and then we asked whether the properties
566.339	of the speech could predict,
569.605	within a window of almost three years,
572.125	the future development of psychosis.
575.427	But despite our hopes,
577.817	we got failure after failure.
581.793	There was just not enough
581.793	information in semantics
585.699	to predict the future
585.699	organization of the mind.
588.516	It was good enough
590.349	to distinguish between a group
590.349	of schizophrenics and a control group,
594.548	a bit like we had done
594.548	for the ancient texts,
597.284	but not to predict the future
597.284	onset of psychosis.
601.164	But then we realized
602.894	that maybe the most important thing
602.894	was not so much what they were saying,
607.006	but how they were saying it.
609.679	More specifically,
610.923	it was not in which semantic
610.923	neighborhoods the words were,
613.774	but how far and fast they jumped
616.398	from one semantic neighborhood
616.398	to the other one.
619.247	And so we came up with this measure,
621.002	which we termed semantic coherence,
623.415	which essentially measures the persistence
623.415	of speech within one semantic topic,
628.243	within one semantic category.
631.294	And it turned out to be
631.294	that for this group of 34 people,
635.365	the algorithm based on semantic
635.365	coherence could predict,
639.048	with 100 percent accuracy,
641.572	who developed psychosis and who will not.
644.976	And this was something
644.976	that could not be achieved --
647.937	not even close --
649.469	with all the other
649.469	existing clinical measures.
654.525	And I remember vividly,
654.525	while I was working on this,
658.128	I was sitting at my computer
660.469	and I saw a bunch of tweets by Polo --
663.128	Polo had been my first student
663.128	back in Buenos Aires,
666.319	and at the time
666.319	he was living in New York.
668.413	And there was something in this tweets --
670.525	I could not tell exactly what
670.525	because nothing was said explicitly --
674.05	but I got this strong hunch,
676.095	this strong intuition,
676.095	that something was going wrong.
680.347	So I picked up the phone,
680.347	and I called Polo,
683.094	and in fact he was not feeling well.
685.362	And this simple fact,
687.323	that reading in between the lines,
689.838	I could sense,
689.838	through words, his feelings,
694.124	was a simple, but very
694.124	effective way to help.
697.987	What I tell you today
699.649	is that we're getting
699.649	close to understanding
702.181	how we can convert this intuition
702.181	that we all have,
706.491	that we all share,
707.88	into an algorithm.
710.102	And in doing so,
711.587	we may be seeing in the future
711.587	a very different form of mental health,
716.261	based on objective, quantitative
716.261	and automated analysis
721.906	of the words we write,
723.639	of the words we say.
725.2	Gracias.
726.375	(Applause)
