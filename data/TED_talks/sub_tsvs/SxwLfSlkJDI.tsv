12.285	Throughout my career, I've been fortunate enough
15.36	to work with many of the great
16.719	international architects,
18.445	documenting their work and observing
20.869	how their designs have the capacity
22.828	to influence the cities in which they sit.
25.797	I think of new cities like Dubai
28.64	or ancient cities like Rome
31.117	with Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum,
34.479	or like right here in New York with the High Line,
37.296	a city which has been so much influenced
39.867	by the development of this.
41.57	But what I find really fascinating
43.645	is what happens when architects and planners leave
46.741	and these places become appropriated by people,
49.86	like here in Chandigarh, India,
52.2	the city which has been completely designed
54.52	by the architect Le Corbusier.
56.659	Now 60 years later, the city has been taken over
59.639	by people in very different ways
61.26	from whatever perhaps intended for,
64.582	like here, where you have the people
66.888	sitting in the windows of the assembly hall.
69.851	But over the course of several years,
71.938	I've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's
74.356	CCTV building in Beijing
76.402	and the olympic stadium in the same city
79.24	by the architects Herzog and de Meuron.
82.384	At these large-scale construction sites in China,
85.829	you see a sort of makeshift camp
87.952	where workers live during the entire building process.
92.142	As the length of the construction takes years,
94.624	workers end up forming a rather rough-and-ready
97.382	informal city, making for quite a juxtaposition
100.648	against the sophisticated structures that they're building.
104.091	Over the past seven years, I've been following
106.3	my fascination with the built environment,
108.971	and for those of you who know me, you would say
111.674	that this obsession has led me to live
113.66	out of a suitcase 365 days a year.
117.082	Being constantly on the move
119.579	means that sometimes I am able
121.394	to catch life's most unpredictable moments,
124.57	like here in New York
126.551	the day after the Sandy storm hit the city.
130.944	Just over three years ago,
133.008	I was for the first time in Caracas, Venezuela,
135.694	and while flying over the city, I was just amazed
138.49	by the extent to which the slums
140.53	reach into every corner of the city,
142.979	a place where nearly 70 percent of the population
145.716	lives in slums,
147.057	draped literally all over the mountains.
150.35	During a conversation with local architects Urban-Think Tank,
153.777	I learned about the Torre David,
156.13	a 45-story office building which sits
158.673	right in the center of Caracas.
160.726	The building was under construction
162.329	until the collapse of the Venezuelan economy
164.855	and the death of the developer in the early '90s.
168.221	About eight years ago, people started moving
171.183	into the abandoned tower
173.196	and began to build their homes right in between
175.215	every column of this unfinished tower.
178.414	There's only one little entrance to the entire building,
181.211	and the 3,000 residents come in and out
184.149	through that single door.
186.217	Together, the inhabitants created public spaces
189.106	and designed them to feel more like a home
191.379	and less like an unfinished tower.
193.974	In the lobby, they painted the walls and planted trees.
197.489	They also made a basketball court.
200.499	But when you look up closely,
202.199	you see massive holes where elevators
204.68	and services would have run through.
207.26	Within the tower, people have come up
209.249	with all sorts of solutions
211.515	in response to the various needs
213.496	which arise from living in an unfinished tower.
216.983	With no elevators,
218.182	the tower is like a 45-story walkup.
221.51	Designed in very specific ways
223.76	by this group of people
225.236	who haven't had any education in architecture or design.
229.132	And with each inhabitant finding their own
231.413	unique way of coming by,
233.38	this tower becomes like a living city,
236.182	a place which is alive with micro-economies
239.394	and small businesses.
241.311	The inventive inhabitants, for instance,
243.925	find opportunities in the most unexpected cases,
246.656	like the adjacent parking garage,
248.781	which has been reclaimed as a taxi route
250.858	to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps
253.156	in order to shorten the hike
254.603	up to the apartments.
258.621	A walk through the tower
260.531	reveals how residents have figured out
262.641	how to create walls, how to make an air flow,
266.167	how to create transparency,
268.13	circulation throughout the tower,
270.554	essentially creating a home
272.373	that's completely adapted
274.021	to the conditions of the site.
277.299	When a new inhabitant moves into the tower,
279.424	they already have a roof over their head,
281.332	so they just typically mark their space
283.371	with a few curtains or sheets.
286.287	Slowly, from found materials, walls rise,
289.459	and people create a space out of any found objects
292.382	or materials.
294.271	It's remarkable to see the design decisions
296.771	that they're making,
298.447	like when everything is made out of red bricks,
301.082	some residents will cover that red brick
303.347	with another layer of red brick-patterned wallpaper
307.208	just to make it a kind of clean finish.
312.26	The inhabitants literally built up these homes
314.719	with their own hands, and this labor of love
316.876	instills a great sense of pride
318.629	in many families living in this tower.
321.881	They typically make the best out of their conditions,
324.815	and try to make their spaces look nice and homey,
327.623	or at least up until as far as they can reach.
331.17	Throughout the tower, you come across
334.182	all kinds of services, like the barber,
336.348	small factories, and every floor has
340.161	a little grocery store or shop.
343.585	And you even find a church.
346.095	And on the 30th floor, there is a gym
348.459	where all the weights and barbells
350.213	are made out of the leftover pulleys
352.009	from the elevators which were never installed.
355.419	From the outside, behind this always-changing facade,
358.054	you see how the fixed concrete beams
359.673	provide a framework for the inhabitants
361.538	to create their homes
363.005	in an organic, intuitive way
364.881	that responds directly to their needs.
367.598	Let's go now to Africa, to Nigeria,
370.253	to a community called Makoko,
372.824	a slum where 150,000 people
375.383	live just meters above the Lagos Lagoon.
378.565	While it may appear to be a completely chaotic place,
382.279	when you see it from above, there seems to be
384.685	a whole grid of waterways and canals
387.85	connecting each and every home.
390.364	From the main dock, people board long wooden canoes
394.578	which carry them out to their various homes and shops
397.248	located in the expansive area.
399.923	When out on the water, it's clear
401.87	that life has been completely adapted
403.759	to this very specific way of living.
406.398	Even the canoes become variety stores
409.045	where ladies paddle from house to house,
410.985	selling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits.
415.101	Behind every window and door frame,
417.12	you'll see a small child peering back at you,
419.823	and while Makoko seems to be packed with people,
422.807	what's more shocking is actually
424.642	the amount of children pouring out of every building.
428.127	The population growth in Nigeria,
430.107	and especially in these areas like Makoko,
432.576	are painful reminders
434.728	of how out of control things really are.
438.967	In Makoko, very few systems
441.246	and infrastructures exist.
443.112	Electricity is rigged and freshest water
446.044	comes from self-built wells throughout the area.
449.409	This entire economic model
451.813	is designed to meet a specific way of living
454.605	on the water, so fishing and boat-making
457.72	are common professions.
459.495	You'll have a set of entrepreneurs
461.462	who have set up businesses throughout the area,
464.486	like barbershops, CD and DVD stores,
469.286	movie theaters, tailors, everything is there.
474.649	There is even a photo studio
476.444	where you see the sort of aspiration
478.201	to live in a real house or to be associated
481.501	with a faraway place, like that hotel in Sweden.
485.8	On this particular evening,
487.424	I came across this live band
489.528	dressed to the T in their coordinating outfits.
492.679	They were floating through the canals
494.709	in a large canoe with a fitted-out generator
497.633	for all of the community to enjoy.
501.969	By nightfall, the area becomes almost pitch black,
504.96	save for a small lightbulb
506.788	or a fire.
509.522	What originally brought me to Makoko
512.137	was this project from a friend of mine,
513.944	Kunl√© Adeyemi, who recently finished building
516.745	this three-story floating school
518.791	for the kids in Makoko.
520.812	With this entire village existing on the water,
523.841	public space is very limited,
526.264	so now that the school is finished,
527.928	the ground floor is a playground for the kids,
531.302	but when classes are out, the platform
533.169	is just like a town square,
534.74	where the fishermen mend their nets
537.135	and floating shopkeepers dock their boats.
541.3	Another place I'd like to share with you
543.83	is the Zabbaleen in Cairo.
545.878	They're descendants of farmers who began migrating
548.637	from the upper Egypt in the '40s,
551.107	and today they make their living
552.533	by collecting and recycling waste from homes
555.723	from all over Cairo.
557.974	For years, the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages
561.096	where they would move around
562.765	trying to avoid the local authorities,
565.284	but in the early 1980s, they settled
567.603	on the Mokattam rocks
569.32	just at the eastern edge of the city.
571.969	Today, they live in this area,
574	approximately 50,000 to 70,000 people,
576.804	who live in this community of self-built
578.937	multi-story houses
581.117	where up to three generations live in one structure.
585.41	While these apartments that they built for themselves
587.888	appear to lack any planning or formal grid,
590.873	each family specializing in a certain form of recycling
594.279	means that the ground floor of each apartment
596.512	is reserved for garbage-related activities
600.169	and the upper floor is dedicated to living space.
604.192	I find it incredible to see
606.063	how these piles and piles of garbage
607.999	are invisible to the people who live there,
610.51	like this very distinguished man who is posing
613.91	while all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him,
618.119	or like these two young men who are sitting
620.759	and chatting amongst these tons of garbage.
625.611	While to most of us, living amongst
627.344	these piles and piles of garbage
629.432	may seem totally uninhabitable,
631.783	to those in the Zabbaleen, this is just
633.873	a different type of normal.
636.352	In all these places I've talked about today,
638.989	what I do find fascinating is that there's really
641.11	no such thing as normal,
642.708	and it proves that people are able to adapt
644.913	to any kind of situation.
647.288	Throughout the day, it's quite common
648.804	to come across a small party taking place
652.152	in the streets, just like this engagement party.
655.996	In this tradition, the bride-to-be
657.983	displays all of their belongings,
660.128	which they soon bring to their new husband.
662.322	A gathering like this one
664.353	offers such a juxtaposition
666.25	where all the new stuff is displayed
669.028	and all the garbage is used
671.394	as props to display all their new home accessories.
678.031	Like Makoko and the Torre David,
680.197	throughout the Zabbaleen you'll find all
681.742	the same facilities as in any typical neighborhood.
684.886	There are the retail shops, the cafes
686.966	and the restaurants, and the community
689.286	is this community of Coptic Christians,
692.227	so you'll also find a church,
694.466	along with the scores of religious iconographies
697.911	throughout the area,
699.669	and also all the everyday services
702.858	like the electronic repair shops,
704.657	the barbers, everything.
707.745	Visiting the homes of the Zabbaleen
709.918	is also full of surprises.
711.607	While from the outside,
713.119	these homes look like any other informal structure
715.662	in the city, when you step inside,
717.98	you are met with all manner of design decisions
721.843	and interior decoration.
724.11	Despite having limited access to space and money,
727.274	the homes in the area are designed
729.153	with care and detail.
731.139	Every apartment is unique,
733.182	and this individuality tells a story
734.975	about each family's circumstances and values.
738.101	Many of these people take their homes
740.247	and interior spaces very seriously,
743.415	putting a lot of work and care
744.922	into the details.
746.248	The shared spaces are also treated in the same manner,
749.421	where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns.
753.278	But despite this elaborate decor,
756.261	sometimes these apartments are used
758.815	in very unexpected ways,
760.625	like this home which caught my attention
763.005	while all the mud and the grass was literally
766.487	seeping out under the front door.
768.974	When I was let in, it appeared that this fifth-floor apartment
772.773	was being transformed into a complete animal farm,
776.081	where six or seven cows stood grazing
778.972	in what otherwise would be the living room.
783.644	But then in the apartment across the hall
787.012	from this cow shed lives a newly married couple
789.535	in what locals describe
791.361	as one of the nicest apartments in the area.
799.482	The attention to this detail astonished me,
802.708	and as the owner of the home so proudly
805.379	led me around this apartment,
807.365	from floor to ceiling, every part was decorated.
811.081	But if it weren't for the strangely familiar
814.883	stomach-churning odor that constantly
817.746	passes through the apartment,
821.191	it would be easy to forget
823.784	that you are standing next to a cow shed
826.476	and on top of a landfill.
831.973	What moved me the most was that despite
834.652	these seemingly inhospitable conditions,
836.686	I was welcomed with open arms
838.479	into a home that was made with love, care,
842.405	and unreserved passion.
844.655	Let's move across the map to China,
848.039	to an area called Shanxi, Henan and Gansu.
851.926	In a region famous for the soft, porous Loess Plateau soil,
855.616	there lived until recently an estimated
862.168	These dwellings are called the yaodongs.
864.619	Through this architecture by subtraction,
866.809	these yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil.
870.396	In these villages, you see an entirely altered landscape,
874.27	and hidden behind these mounds of dirt
877.016	are these square, rectangular houses
879.516	which sit seven meters below the ground.
882.107	When I asked people why they were digging
884.095	their houses from the ground,
885.984	they simply replied that they are poor wheat
888.007	and apple farmers who didn't have the money
890.187	to buy materials, and this digging out
893.588	was their most logical form of living.
898.056	From Makoko to Zabbaleen, these communities
900.954	have approached the tasks of planning,
902.953	design and management of their communities
905.352	and neighborhoods in ways that respond
907.731	specifically to their environment and circumstances.
911.641	Created by these very people who live,
913.872	work and play in these particular spaces,
917.583	these neighborhoods are intuitively designed
920.58	to make the most of their circumstances.
923.618	In most of these places, the government
925.523	is completely absent, leaving inhabitants
928.052	with no choice but to reappropriate found materials,
931.971	and while these communities are highly disadvantaged,
934.943	they do present examples
936.985	of brilliant forms of ingenuity,
939.433	and prove that indeed we have the ability
941.761	to adapt to all manner of circumstances.
945.304	What makes places like the Torre David
947.497	particularly remarkable
949.294	is this sort of skeleton framework
951.195	where people can have a foundation
952.817	where they can tap into.
954.889	Now imagine what these already ingenious communities
957.987	could create themselves,
960.079	and how highly particular their solutions would be,
962.765	if they were given the basic infrastructures
965.307	that they could tap into.
967.286	Today, you see these large residential development projects
970.793	which offer cookie-cutter housing solutions
973.248	to massive amounts of people.
975.29	From China to Brazil, these projects attempt
977.85	to provide as many houses as possible,
980.857	but they're completely generic
983.06	and simply do not work as an answer
984.965	to the individual needs of the people.
988.294	I would like to end with a quote
990.748	from a friend of mine and a source of inspiration,
993.829	Zita Cobb, the founder of the wonderful
996.595	Shorefast Foundation,
998.271	based out of Fogo Island, Newfoundland.
1001.36	"She says that ""there's this plague of sameness"
1004.201	"which is killing the human joy,"""
1006.124	and I couldn't agree with her more.
1008.419	Thank you.
1009.862	(Applause)
