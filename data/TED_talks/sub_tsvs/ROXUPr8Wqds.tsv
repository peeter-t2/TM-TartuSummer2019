17.057	So I want to talk a little bit about seeing the world
19.524	from a totally unique point of view,
22.25	and this world I'm going to talk about is the micro world.
25.275	I've found, after doing this for many, many years,
27.855	that there's a magical world behind reality.
30.571	And that can be seen directly through a microscope,
33.73	and I'm going to show you some of this today.
35.835	So let's start off looking at something rather not-so-small,
39.522	something that we can see with our naked eye,
41.786	and that's a bee. So when you look at this bee,
44.227	it's about this size here, it's about a centimeter.
47.123	But to really see the details of the bee, and really
49.411	appreciate what it is, you have to look a little bit closer.
53.14	So that's just the eye of the bee with a microscope,
56.226	and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has
58.573	thousands of individual eyes called ommatidia,
61.404	and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes
63.836	so they know when they're right up close to something,
66.205	because they can't see in stereo.
69.909	As we go smaller, here is a human hair.
73.613	A human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see.
76.432	It's about a tenth of a millimeter.
79.166	And as we go smaller again,
80.342	about ten times smaller than that, is a cell.
83.748	So you could fit 10 human cells
86.331	across the diameter of a human hair.
89.997	So when we would look at cells, this is how I really got
91.583	involved in biology and science is by looking
94.851	at living cells in the microscope.
97.318	When I first saw living cells in a microscope, I was
99.389	absolutely enthralled and amazed at what they looked like.
103.288	So if you look at the cell like that from the immune system,
106.604	they're actually moving all over the place.
108.443	This cell is looking for foreign objects,
112.193	bacteria, things that it can find.
114.55	And it's looking around, and when it finds something,
117.198	and recognizes it being foreign,
119.494	it will actually engulf it and eat it.
120.786	So if you look right there, it finds that little bacterium,
125.07	and it engulfs it and eats it.
130.692	If you take some heart cells from an animal,
133.873	and put it in a dish, they'll just sit there and beat.
136.769	That's their job. Every cell has a mission in life,
140.359	and these cells, the mission is
142.16	to move blood around our body.
145.687	These next cells are nerve cells, and right now,
148.471	as we see and understand what we're looking at,
151.407	our brains and our nerve cells are actually doing this
153.521	right now. They're not just static. They're moving around
156.063	making new connections, and that's what happens when we learn.
159.565	As you go farther down this scale here,
162.355	that's a micron, or a micrometer, and we go
165.259	all the way down to here to a nanometer
167.607	and an angstrom. Now, an angstrom is the size
170.364	of the diameter of a hydrogen atom.
173.731	That's how small that is.
175.364	And microscopes that we have today can actually see
177.681	individual atoms. So these are some pictures
180.739	of individual atoms. Each bump here is an individual atom.
183.572	This is a ring of cobalt atoms.
186.401	So this whole world, the nano world, this area in here
189.059	is called the nano world, and the nano world,
192.254	the whole micro world that we see,
195.388	there's a nano world that is wrapped up within that, and
198.421	the whole -- and that is the world of molecules and atoms.
202.816	But I want to talk about this larger world,
205.274	the world of the micro world.
207.611	So if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower,
211.73	what would that flower look like, if the flower was this big?
214.881	It wouldn't look or feel like anything that we see
217.396	when we look at a flower. So if you look at this flower here,
220.69	and you're a little bug, if you're on that surface
222.522	of that flower, that's what the terrain would look like.
226.588	The petal of that flower looks like that, so the ant
228.964	is kind of crawling over these objects, and if you look
231.645	a little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here,
234.989	this is the style of that flower, and you notice
237.734	that it's got these little -- these are like little jelly-like things
241.959	that are what are called spurs. These are nectar spurs.
246.701	So this little ant that's crawling here, it's like
249.318	it's in a little Willy Wonka land.
251.144	It's like a little Disneyland for them. It's not like what we see.
255.279	These are little bits of individual grain of pollen
259.182	there and there, and here is a --
262.628	what you see as one little yellow dot of pollen,
265.206	when you look in a microscope, it's actually made
267.17	of thousands of little grains of pollen.
270.934	So this, for example, when you see bees flying around
273.169	these little plants, and they're collecting pollen,
275.974	those pollen grains that they're collecting, they pack
278.397	into their legs and they take it back to the hive,
280.83	and that's what makes the beehive,
283.46	the wax in the beehive. And they're also collecting nectar,
287.278	and that's what makes the honey that we eat.
291.189	Here's a close-up picture, or this is actually a regular picture
294.446	of a water hyacinth, and if you had really, really good vision,
297.119	with your naked eye, you'd see it about that well.
299.68	There's the stamen and the pistil. But look what the stamen
302.308	and the pistil look like in a microscope. That's the stamen.
305.822	So that's thousands of little grains of pollen there,
308.473	and there's the pistil there, and these are the little things
311.759	called trichomes. And that's what makes the flower give
315.478	a fragrance, and plants actually communicate
319.438	with one another through their fragrances.
324.832	I want to talk about something really ordinary,
327.2	just ordinary sand.
329.124	I became interested in sand about 10 years ago,
331.054	when I first saw sand from Maui,
333.615	and in fact, this is a little bit of sand from Maui.
336.762	So sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size.
339.793	Each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size.
342.704	But when you look closer at this, look at what's there.
345.287	It's really quite amazing. You have microshells there.
348.789	You have things like coral.
350.982	You have fragments of other shells. You have olivine.
354.516	You have bits of a volcano. There's a little bit
356.712	of a volcano there. You have tube worms.
359.339	An amazing array of incredible things exist in sand.
364.065	And the reason that is, is because in a place like this island,
366.744	a lot of the sand is made of biological material
369.11	because the reefs provide a place where all these
372.107	microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow,
375.997	and when they die, their shells and their teeth
378.335	and their bones break up and they make grains of sand,
380.677	things like coral and so forth.
383.647	So here's, for example, a picture of sand from Maui.
387.44	This is from Lahaina,
389.977	and when we're walking along a beach, we're actually
391.707	walking along millions of years of biological and geological history.
395.161	We don't realize it, but it's actually a record
397.628	of that entire ecology.
400.201	So here we see, for example, a sponge spicule,
403.359	two bits of coral here,
405.945	that's a sea urchin spine. Really some amazing stuff.
409.795	So when I first looked at this, I was -- I thought,
412.172	gee, this is like a little treasure trove here.
413.921	I couldn't believe it, and I'd go around dissecting
416.087	the little bits out and making photographs of them.
419.396	Here's what most of the sand in our world looks like.
421.907	These are quartz crystals and feldspar,
425.168	so most sand in the world on the mainland
427.629	is made of quartz crystal and feldspar. It's the erosion of granite rock.
431.379	So mountains are built up, and they erode away by water
435.73	and rain and ice and so forth,
437.757	and they become grains of sand.
439.063	There's some sand that's really much more colorful.
441.513	These are sand from near the Great Lakes,
443.597	and you can see that it's filled with minerals
445.608	like pink garnet and green epidote, all kinds of amazing stuff,
449.1	and if you look at different sands from different places,
451.484	every single beach, every single place you look at sand,
454.735	it's different. Here's from Big Sur, like they're little jewels.
459.767	There are places in Africa where they do the mining
462.256	of jewels, and you go to the sand where the rivers have
466.425	the sand go down to the ocean, and it's like literally looking
468.724	at tiny jewels through the microscope.
471.587	So every grain of sand is unique. Every beach is different.
474.764	Every single grain is different. There are no two grains
477.946	of sand alike in the world.
479.646	Every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere.
483.178	They're like a snapshot in time.
486.906	Now sand is not only on Earth, but sand is
490.329	ubiquitous throughout the universe. In fact, outer space
492.927	is filled with sand, and that sand comes together
496.591	to make our planets and the Moon.
499.788	And you can see those in micrometeorites.
501.37	This is some micrometeorites that the Army gave me,
503.913	and they get these out of the drinking wells in the South Pole.
507.007	And they're quite amazing-looking, and these are the
509.753	tiny constituents that make up the world that we live in --
514.177	the planets and the Moon.
516.092	So NASA wanted me to take some pictures of Moon sand,
519.336	so they sent me sand from all the different landings
521.599	of the Apollo missions that happened 40 years ago.
526.077	And I started taking pictures with my three-dimensional microscopes.
529.717	This was the first picture I took. It was kind of amazing.
532.684	I thought it looked kind of a little bit like the Moon, which is sort of interesting.
536.467	Now, the way my microscopes work is, normally
539.13	in a microscope you can see very little at one time,
541.596	so what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope,
544.543	keep taking pictures, and then I have a computer program
548.334	that puts all those pictures together
550.808	into one picture so you can see actually what it looks like,
553.93	and I do that in 3D. So there, you can see,
557.165	is a left-eye view. There's a right-eye view.
559.867	So sort of left-eye view, right-eye view.
562.42	Now something's interesting here. This looks very different
564.788	than any sand on Earth that I've ever seen, and I've
567.166	seen a lot of sand on Earth, believe me. (Laughter)
570.966	Look at this hole in the middle. That hole was caused
573.924	by a micrometeorite hitting the Moon.
576.263	Now, the Moon has no atmosphere, so micrometeorites
578.62	come in continuously, and the whole surface of the Moon
581.836	is covered with powder now, because for four billion years
584.436	it's been bombarded by micrometeorites,
587.23	and when micrometeorites come in at about
593.63	And you can see here that that is --
595.54	that's sort of vaporized, and that material is holding this
598.134	little clump of little sand grains together.
600.68	This is a very small grain of sand, this whole thing.
602.859	And that's called a ring agglutinate.
605.019	And many of the grains of sand on the Moon look like that,
608.963	and you'd never find that on Earth.
612.42	Most of the sand on the Moon,
615.673	especially -- and you know when you look at the Moon,
617.372	there's the dark areas and the light areas. The dark areas
619.732	are lava flows. They're basaltic lava flows,
623.873	and that's what this sand looks like, very similar
626.538	to the sand that you would see in Haleakala.
630.301	Other sands, when these micrometeorites come in,
633.724	they vaporize and they make these fountains,
636.813	these microscopic fountains that go up into the --
639.436	"I was going to say ""up into the air,"" but there is no air --"
641.8	goes sort of up, and these microscopic glass beads
646.051	are formed instantly, and they harden, and by the time
648.564	they fall down back to the surface of the Moon,
651.949	they have these beautiful colored glass spherules.
654.845	And these are actually microscopic;
656.39	you need a microscope to see these.
659.358	Now here's a grain of sand that is from the Moon,
662.795	and you can see that the entire
664.949	crystal structure is still there.
667.432	This grain of sand is probably about
669.58	three and a half or four billion years old,
671.862	and it's never eroded away like the way we have sand
674.053	on Earth erodes away because of water and tumbling,
678.072	air, and so forth. All you can see is a little bit of erosion
681.322	down here by the Sun, has these solar storms,
685.929	and that's erosion by solar radiation.
690.692	So what I've been trying to tell you today is
693.278	things even as ordinary as a grain of sand
696.847	can be truly extraordinary if you look closely
699.822	and if you look from a different and a new point of view.
703.127	I think that this was best put by William Blake when he said,
707.502	"""To see a world in a grain of sand"
710.044	and a heaven in a wild flower,
712.798	hold infinity in the palm of your hand,
715.131	"and eternity in an hour."""
717.464	Thank you. (Applause)
