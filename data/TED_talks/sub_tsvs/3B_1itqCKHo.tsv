12.2	Today I'm going to talk about work.
15.13	And the question I want to ask
15.13	and answer is this:
18.19	"""Why do we work?"""
21.14	Why do we drag ourselves
21.14	out of bed every morning
25.07	instead of living our lives
27.11	just filled with bouncing from one
27.11	TED-like adventure to another?
32.19	(Laughter)
34.01	You may be asking yourselves
34.01	that very question.
37.09	Now, I know of course,
37.09	we have to make a living,
39.21	but nobody in this room thinks
39.21	that that's the answer to the question,
43.06	"""Why do we work?"""
44.11	For folks in this room,
44.11	the work we do is challenging,
48.11	it's engaging, it's stimulating,
48.11	it's meaningful.
52.02	And if we're lucky,
52.02	it might even be important.
55.16	So, we wouldn't work
55.16	if we didn't get paid,
57.17	but that's not why we do what we do.
60.05	And in general,
61.1	I think we think that material rewards
61.1	are a pretty bad reason
64.17	for doing the work that we do.
66.1	When we say of somebody
66.1	"that he's ""in it for the money,"""
70.14	we are not just being descriptive.
73.02	(Laughter)
74.1	Now, I think this is totally obvious,
76.13	but the very obviousness of it
76.13	raises what is for me
79.12	an incredibly profound question.
81.23	Why, if this is so obvious,
84.05	why is it that for the overwhelming
84.05	majority of people on the planet,
90.06	the work they do
90.06	has none of the characteristics
94.02	that get us up and out of bed
94.02	and off to the office every morning?
98.21	How is it that we allow
98.21	the majority of people on the planet
102.11	to do work that is monotonous,
102.11	meaningless and soul-deadening?
107.11	Why is it that as capitalism developed,
110.08	it created a mode of production,
110.08	of goods and services,
113.13	in which all the nonmaterial satisfactions
113.13	that might come from work were eliminated?
120.09	Workers who do this kind of work,
122.11	whether they do it in factories,
122.11	in call centers,
125.07	or in fulfillment warehouses,
127.19	do it for pay.
129.19	There is certainly no other earthly reason
129.19	to do what they do except for pay.
135.01	"So the question is, ""Why?"""
138	And here's the answer:
140.16	the answer is technology.
143.11	Now, I know, I know --
144.2	yeah, yeah, yeah, technology, automation
144.2	screws people, blah blah --
148.09	that's not what I mean.
149.21	I'm not talking about
149.21	the kind of technology
152.13	that has enveloped our lives,
152.13	and that people come to TED to hear about.
156.13	I'm not talking about
156.13	the technology of things,
159.12	profound though that is.
161.11	I'm talking about another technology.
163.1	I'm talking about the technology of ideas.
167.05	"I call it, ""idea technology"" --"
169.14	how clever of me.
170.22	(Laughter)
172.03	In addition to creating things,
172.03	science creates ideas.
176.15	Science creates ways of understanding.
179.13	And in the social sciences,
181.08	the ways of understanding that get created
181.08	are ways of understanding ourselves.
186.07	And they have an enormous influence
186.07	on how we think, what we aspire to,
190.14	and how we act.
192.04	If you think your poverty
192.04	is God's will, you pray.
196.05	If you think your poverty is the result
196.05	of your own inadequacy,
200.17	you shrink into despair.
203.12	And if you think your poverty is
203.12	the result of oppression and domination,
207.22	then you rise up in revolt.
209.23	Whether your response to poverty
209.23	is resignation or revolution,
214.03	depends on how you understand
214.03	the sources of your poverty.
217.21	This is the role that ideas play
217.21	in shaping us as human beings,
223.11	and this is why idea technology may be
223.11	the most profoundly important technology
229.05	that science gives us.
231.1	And there's something special
231.1	about idea technology,
235.12	that makes it different
235.12	from the technology of things.
238.04	With things, if the technology sucks,
241.19	it just vanishes, right?
244	Bad technology disappears.
246.12	With ideas --
248.02	false ideas about human beings
248.02	will not go away
253.06	if people believe that they're true.
256.23	Because if people believe
256.23	that they're true,
259.11	they create ways of living
259.11	and institutions
262.16	that are consistent
262.16	with these very false ideas.
266.02	And that's how the industrial revolution
266.02	created a factory system
270.05	in which there was really nothing you
270.05	could possibly get out of your day's work,
274.2	except for the pay at the end of the day.
277.08	Because the father --
277.08	one of the fathers
279.07	of the Industrial Revolution,
279.07	Adam Smith --
281.13	was convinced that human beings
281.13	were by their very natures lazy,
285.11	and wouldn't do anything
285.11	unless you made it worth their while,
288.12	and the way you made it worth their while
290.12	was by incentivizing,
290.12	by giving them rewards.
293.12	That was the only reason
293.12	anyone ever did anything.
296.07	So we created a factory system consistent
296.07	with that false view of human nature.
301.22	But once that system
301.22	of production was in place,
304.19	there was really no other way
304.19	for people to operate,
307.19	except in a way that was consistent
307.19	with Adam Smith's vision.
312.15	So the work example is merely an example
315.16	of how false ideas
315.16	can create a circumstance
319.22	that ends up making them true.
323.14	It is not true
325.16	"that you ""just can't get"
325.16	"good help anymore."""
329.21	It is true
331.12	"that you ""can't get good help anymore"""
334.04	when you give people work to do
334.04	that is demeaning and soulless.
339.03	And interestingly enough, Adam Smith --
341.1	the same guy who gave us
341.1	this incredible invention
345.07	of mass production, and division of labor
347.18	-- understood this.
348.23	He said, of people who worked
348.23	in assembly lines,
352.18	of men who worked
352.18	in assembly lines, he says:
354.21	"""He generally becomes as stupid as it is"
354.21	"possible for a human being to become."""
361.17	"Now, notice the word here is ""become."""
363.2	"""He generally becomes as stupid as it is"
363.2	"possible for a human being to become."""
369.23	Whether he intended it or not,
369.23	what Adam Smith was telling us there,
373.13	is that the very shape of the institution
373.13	within which people work
377.04	creates people who are fitted
377.04	to the demands of that institution
381.14	and deprives people of the opportunity
384.04	to derive the kinds of satisfactions
384.04	from their work that we take for granted.
389.1	The thing about science --
389.1	natural science --
392.1	is that we can spin fantastic
392.1	theories about the cosmos,
396.22	and have complete confidence
398.17	that the cosmos is completely
398.17	indifferent to our theories.
403	It's going to work the same damn way
405.02	no matter what theories
405.02	we have about the cosmos.
408.23	But we do have to worry about
408.23	the theories we have of human nature,
414.09	because human nature will be changed
414.09	by the theories we have
419.17	that are designed to explain
419.17	and help us understand human beings.
423.17	The distinguished anthropologist,
423.17	Clifford Geertz, said, years ago,
428.15	that human beings
428.15	"are the ""unfinished animals."""
432.04	And what he meant by that
432.04	was that it is only human nature
436.22	to have a human nature
438.14	that is very much the product
438.14	of the society in which people live.
443.01	That human nature,
443.01	that is to say our human nature,
446.12	is much more created
446.12	than it is discovered.
450.1	We design human nature
452.15	by designing the institutions
452.15	within which people live and work.
457.08	And so you people --
458.22	pretty much the closest I ever get
458.22	to being with masters of the universe --
463.04	you people should be asking
463.04	yourself a question,
467.02	as you go back home
467.02	to run your organizations.
470.06	Just what kind of human nature
470.06	do you want to help design?
474.14	Thank you.
475.2	(Applause)
477.09	Thanks.
