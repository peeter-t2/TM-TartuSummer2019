17.16	[SHIT]
19.16	This is arguably the back end
19.16	of the design of animals.
22.16	(Laughter)
25.16	But the reason
25.16	I put this up here is because
28.604	when I was in Africa last year,
28.604	my wife and I were driving around,
32.739	we had this wonderful guide,
34.985	who showed us something
34.985	that surprised both of us,
38.16	and it was very revealing
38.16	in terms of the fascination
41.16	that comes with the design of animals.
43.16	It turns out that in about the 1880s,
43.16	the missionaries came to Africa
47.16	to spread the word of Christianity,
49.16	to teach English to the natives.
51.161	And they brought blackboards and chalk.
54.078	And I'd like you to imagine
54.078	that that's a blackboard,
56.655	and I just used some chalk on there.
58.501	And they brought
58.501	quite a bit of this stuff.
61.005	But over the years,
61.005	the blackboards were fine,
63.587	but they ran out of chalk.
65.588	And this is a real crisis for them.
67.751	And that's where the hyena comes in.
70.878	The hyena is probably
70.878	the most perfectly designed
73.26	scavenging animal in the world.
75.161	It strip-mines carcasses,
75.161	and it has amazing teeth,
79.16	because it enables the hyena
79.16	to essentially eat bones.
84.16	Now, the end product of that action
84.16	is up on the board here.
89.911	What the missionaries would do is,
89.911	they'd walk around
95.197	and they'd pick up hyena shit.
97.16	And the incredible thing
97.16	about hyena shit is, it makes great chalk.
101.119	(Laughter)
102.239	That's not what I'm here to talk about,
104.16	but it is a fascinating aspect
104.16	of animal design.
108.795	What I'm here to talk about is the camel.
111.16	When I started talking to Richard
113.16	about what I was going to speak about,
115.16	I had recently come back from Jordan,
117.808	where I had an amazing
117.808	experience with a camel.
121.16	(Laughter)
124.16	And we were in the desert.
125.605	Richard Wurman: That's the end!
125.605	Keith Bellows: Yeah, yeah.
128.446	We were in the desert,
128.446	in Wadi Rum, in a small Jeep.
131.715	There were four of us,
131.715	two Bedouin drivers.
134.16	You can just imagine,
134.16	this expanse is an ocean of sand,
140.858	And we were driving in what they told us
140.858	was their very, very best Jeep.
146.342	Didn't look like it to me.
148.786	And as we started to go
148.786	through the desert,
152.855	the Jeep broke down.
154.16	The guys got out, they put the hood up,
156.16	they started working
156.16	under the hood, got it going again.
158.859	About a hundred yards, it broke down.
160.653	This went on about 6-7 times,
160.653	we were getting more and more alarmed,
163.954	we were also getting deeper
163.954	and deeper into the desert.
166.636	And eventually,
166.636	our worst nightmare happened:
169.16	they flooded the engine.
171.16	"And they said, ""Ah, no problem!"
171.16	"We just get out and walk."""
175.355	"And we said, ""We get out and walk?"""
177.161	One water bottle, remember,
177.161	guys, four people.
179.437	"And they said, ""Yeah, yeah, we'll walk."
179.437	"We'll find some camels."""
183.104	We got out and walked, and sure enough,
185.081	about half a mile, we came
185.081	over the crest of this hill,
187.715	and there was a huge gathering
187.715	of Bedouin with their camels.
190.637	The guy went up and started dickering,
192.556	and 10 dollars later, we had four camels.
195.16	They went down like elevators;
195.16	we got on them.
197.702	They went back up, and the Bedouin,
197.702	each Bedouin, four of them,
201.16	got behind each of the camels
201.16	with a little whip.
204.16	And they started slashing away
204.16	at the back of the camels,
207.16	and they started galloping.
208.476	And if you've ever been on a camel,
208.476	it is a very, very uncomfortable ride.
212.16	There's also one other aspect
212.16	about these camels.
215.16	About every 10 steps, they lean back
217.16	and try to take a chunk out of your leg.
219.16	(Laughter)
220.263	So we kept on going,
222.16	and this camel kept on trying
222.16	to take a chunk out of my leg.
225.16	And eventually, three miles later,
225.16	we arrived at our destination,
228.318	where a Jeep was supposed to meet us.
230.16	And the camels come down
230.16	again like elevators,
232.636	we sort of clumsily get off,
234.16	and they, obviously, try to take
234.16	another chunk out of my leg.
237.16	And I've developed
237.16	a very wonderful relationship
240.16	with this creature by this point,
242.16	and I've realized
242.16	that this is a mean son of a bitch.
246.16	And much meaner, by the way,
246.16	than the Bedouin who greeted me
249.16	and tried to sell me
249.16	one of his 26 daughters
251.724	to take back to the States.
254.16	So as we talked, Richard and I,
256.058	"I said, ""You know, maybe"
256.058	I should bring a camel.
258.343	It's the best designed
258.343	"animal in the world."""
260.6	"He went, ""Nah. I don't think"
260.6	"we want to be bringing a camel."""
263.508	And you should be really glad
263.508	we decided not to bring the camel.
266.669	So I did the next best thing.
269.16	I went to the Washington Zoo.
271.145	"Richard said, ""I want you to get up"
271.145	close and personal with this camel.
275.729	I want you to inspect its mouth,
275.729	look at its teeth.
278.697	Go underneath it.
278.697	Go above it. Go around it.
281.16	Pull its tail up; take a look in there.
283.898	I want you to get as close
283.898	"to that camel as you possibly can."""
287.16	So, I got a National Geographic film crew.
290.826	We went down there,
290.826	and I took one look at this camel.
296.542	It is a 2,000 pound creature
296.542	who is in rut.
301.16	(Laughter)
303.978	Now, if you've ever seen
303.978	a 2,000 pound camel in rut,
306.859	it is a scary, scary thing to behold.
310.017	And if Richard thought I was getting
310.017	in the ring with that camel,
313.707	someone was smoking Bedouin high grade.
316.16	(Laughter)
317.366	So we got as close to it as possible,
321.16	and I'm going to share this.
322.526	Chris, if you want to roll this film.
324.319	Then I'm going to show you
325.597	a little bit more
325.597	about the design of camels.
327.717	Do you want to roll the film?
329.447	(Adventure music)
364.365	(Video) Hello. This is Keith Bellows
366.125	with the TED National Geographic
366.125	Camel Investigation Unit.
369.643	I'm here to look
369.643	at the ultimate desert machine.
373.076	(Music continues)
380.072	Keith Bellows: And you'll note
380.072	I started chewing gum
382.589	because I was around this camel all day.
385.124	(Video) That's it, OK. No!
387.787	See, now he's getting
387.787	a little overexcited.
389.841	So we'll need to be very careful
389.841	around him. Don't let him get you.
415.334	Now, you can see copious amounts
415.334	of saliva in there.
422.436	I always called myself
422.436	the unstable stable boy.
425.584	Their nose, you can see
425.584	his nose is flared right now.
429.445	When they're in rut,
429.445	they're similar to seals
432.931	in the way, like, a seal has
432.931	to open its nose to breathe.
437.16	And they're similar.
437.16	They have to consciously open their nose.
441.147	KB: Ears?
442.172	SK: They are small.
442.172	But they have excellent hearing.
446.16	But not big; for instance,
446.16	in zebras, they have a huge ear
452.255	that's very mobile, so they can
452.255	actually turn them both around.
456.16	And they use them in the same way
456.16	we use our binocular vision.
459.16	They use that to pinpoint sound.
462.16	The desert's extremely windy
462.16	as well as being very cold.
466.341	So not only do they have
466.341	the very long eyelashes,
470.836	but there's the secondary --
472.719	I guess you'd call it
472.719	the [unclear] or whatever.
476.16	It's this hair that's above the eyes,
476.16	and below it, it's longer.
481.16	Most people think
481.16	that the humps store water.
484.16	They don't. They store fat.
489.16	Now, I'm not a chemist,
489.16	but basically what happens
493.763	is the fat is oxidized by their breathing.
499.651	And that will turn it
499.651	into actually usable water.
504.557	Like a lot of predators,
504.557	they walk on their toes.
508.496	But there's a big fat pad
508.496	in there that squishes out.
512.16	They're like sun shoes,
512.16	but, you know, with sand.
518.03	Hooves? They don't have
518.03	traditional hooves,
522.16	but they do have one, like, big nail.
524.144	(Audience laughter)
525.462	You can't really see too clear.
525.462	The fur's kind of grown over.
528.463	But they use their tails a lot,
528.463	especially in rut.
532.358	He will urinate and spin his tail
532.358	to spread the urine around
538.16	and make him more attractive.
541.16	I don't know why that would be,
541.16	but it works for them.
544.28	So, what the hell.
545.799	(Audience laughter)
547.16	Now, they will also defecate
547.16	in certain areas.
551.953	Generally, they poop
551.953	wherever they want to,
554.552	but during their rut,
554.552	they will defecate in perimeter areas.
561.09	I don't know if you've read or heard
561.09	about the sub-sonic sounds from elephants,
566.16	"you know what I mean, like, ""Br-r-r!"""
569.16	These big, big rumbling sounds.
569.16	He will do the same thing.
572.16	You can actually see,
572.16	right here, it will vibrate.
576.071	We weigh our animals.
577.993	Unfortunately,
577.993	he's a very aggressive animal,
582.16	so he's actually destroyed
582.16	some of the scales.
585.16	We had these big things that I weigh
585.16	the bison on, for instance.
588.232	I'm guessing that
588.232	he's at least 1,600 pounds.
591.98	But I would put him closer to 2,000.
594.16	He's basically a walking mulch pile.
596.575	We're kind of like buds,
596.575	but I'm also a male as well.
599.701	KB: He sees you as competition?
599.701	Senior Keeper: Yeah, exactly.
602.628	And it makes him very dangerous
602.628	at this time of year.
605.16	Don't even think about it.
605.16	Don't think about it!
611.194	But now, we're going to meet. Out!
614.874	Out! Out!
619.087	No.
621.16	Out!
623.602	(Music)
647.136	(Applause)
648.16	KB: What I didn't show you was,
648.16	you got that swinging thing going?
653.484	Well, and you're glad
653.484	I didn't show you this.
656.582	One of the other things
656.582	about the camel's beautiful design
659.36	is that its penis points backwards.
661.574	That way the camel can dip
661.574	its tail in the stream,
665.701	and just whacker
665.701	the entire area around him.
669.16	And that's how
669.16	he really marks his territory.
671.652	Now, what you also didn't see was that --
674.16	and you may have noticed
674.16	in the pen beside him
677.16	and, by the way, the camel's name is Suki.
679.938	In the pen beside him is Jasmine.
682.16	Jasmine has been his mate for some time.
684.43	But on this particular occasion,
684.43	it was very, very clear
687.894	that as horny as Suki was,
687.894	Jasmine was having none of it.
693.16	And so we started thinking.
695.16	Well, if poor old Suki
695.16	is in search of a mate,
699.16	what would Suki do to find
699.16	the perfect mate?
701.962	I'm going to show you another film.
703.659	But before I do, I just want to mention
706.033	that this animal truly is a sort
706.033	of the SUV of the sand,
710.16	the ship of the desert.
712.61	It's so vital to the inhabitants
712.61	of the areas
718.16	in which the camel is found,
718.16	largely Mongolia and Sahara,
720.906	that there are 160 words
720.906	in Arabic to describe the camel.
726.453	And if this is a creature
726.453	that was designed by committee,
729.16	it's certainly been
729.16	like no committee I've ever been on.
732.16	So here's what Suki would do
732.16	in search of a mate.
739.024	Can you roll it, please?
740.208	Camel seeking camel
741.835	Lusty beast desires
741.835	attractive and sincere mate.
744.795	I'm seven feet, 2,000 lbs.,
744.795	with brown hair and eyes, long legs --
748.058	and I'm very well ... hung.
754.643	I'm TED Camel.
756.319	The perfect desert machine.
760.399	I'm smartly designed.
762.954	Eyelashes that keep out sand
764.619	and a third eyelash that works
764.619	like a windshield wiper.
769.16	A distinguished nose --
772.16	with nostrils lined
772.16	to filter out sand and dust
777.043	and a groove that catches moisture.
779.922	Amazingly full lips --
784.16	that allow me to eat practically
784.16	anything that grows.
789.16	Callouses on my knees
789.16	that let me kneel comfortably.
795.16	Leathery chest pads that beat the heat.
798.16	Short fur that keeps my skin cool.
802.16	Long legs that allow heat to escape.
807.16	And my hump?
810.16	Ogden Nash once wrote:
812.16	"""The camel has a single hump;"
812.16	the dromedary two,
814.423	or else the other way around.
814.423	"I'm never sure. Are you?"""
818.059	Here's a hint:
819.16	Bactarian.
821.16	Dromedary.
825.905	My hump contains up to 80 lbs. of fat,
825.905	but doesn't store H2O.
830.16	I'm built to last.
835.652	I'm the go-to animal
835.652	when the oasis is dry.
839.16	I usually won't sweat
839.16	until my body reaches 105 ºF,
841.565	enough to fry an egg.
844.16	I'm able to lose 40%
844.16	of my weight without dying.
849.409	(Most animals would
849.409	if they lost half that much.)
853.16	I'll drink 5 to 7 gallons
853.16	of water a day.
859.16	But go without for more than a month.
861.874	I'm powerful.
863.59	Able to pack up to 400 lbs. of cargo.
868.16	Outrun a horse --
871.969	And cover 26 miles on a good day.
876.749	Camelot.
878.16	Jackie O. once said
878.16	that traveling by camel
880.232	made riding an elephant seem
880.232	like taking a jet plane.
887.112	Yet my large, soft feet
887.112	allow me to navigate sand.
892.16	(Is that why the Bedouin
892.16	claim I can dance?)
897.16	I'm a good provider, too.
899.16	Bedouins call the camel the Gift of God.
902.001	No surprise.
903.292	Tents and rugs are made of my hair.
905.16	My dried bones are prized
905.16	as a sort of ivory.
907.327	My dung is burned as fuel.
907.327	My milk is used for cheese.
909.923	"""Camels are like angels,"""
909.923	a Bedouin once said.
914.16	(Applause)
916.763	Thank you. I just want to leave you
916.763	with one last thought,
920.16	which is probably the most important
920.16	thing to take away.
924.882	Humans, the animal, are pretty lucky
924.882	creatures because, by and large,
931.16	we really don't have
931.16	to adapt to our environment;
935.16	we adapt our environment to us.
937.16	And we've seen that repeatedly
937.16	through this conference,
940.16	not just this year, but in past years.
942.16	But this creature that you've just seen
945.16	ultimately adapts,
945.16	and keeps adapting and adapting.
948.018	I think when you look
948.018	at the animal kingdom,
950.16	that is one of the most remarkable things.
952.184	It doesn't have an environment
952.184	that adapts to it;
955.094	it has to adapt to the environment.
956.914	Ricky, thank you very much for having me.
958.913	RW: That's terrific. Thank you.
