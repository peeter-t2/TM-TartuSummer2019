12.877	As a scientist, and also as a human being,
16.12	I've been trying to make myself
18.124	susceptible to wonder.
21.499	I think Jason Webley last night called it
24.368	"""conspiring to be part of the magic."""
28.395	So it's fortunate that my career as a biologist
31.216	lets me dive deeply into the lives
33.86	of some truly wondrous creatures
36.378	that share our planet:
38.757	fireflies.
40.452	Now, for many of you, I know that fireflies
42.735	might conjure up some really great memories:
45.478	childhood, summertime,
48.532	even other TED Talks.
50.302	Maybe something like this.
57.36	My seduction into the world of fireflies
59.815	began when I was back in graduate school.
63.664	One evening, I was sitting out in my backyard
66.488	in North Carolina,
68.426	and suddenly, these silent sparks
73.725	rose up all around me,
75.579	and I began to wonder:
76.961	How do these creatures make light,
79.651	and what's with all this flashing?
81.341	Are they talking to one another?
83.18	And what happens after the lights go out?
86.371	I've been lucky enough to answer
87.662	some of these questions
89.03	as I've explored this nocturnal world.
93.121	Now if you've ever seen
95.46	or even heard about fireflies,
97.561	then you'll know how magically they can transform
100.207	our everyday landscape into something
102.598	ethereal and otherworldly,
104.501	and this happens around the globe,
106.442	like this hillside in the Smoky Mountains
108.532	that I saw transformed into a living cascade of light
112.618	by the eerie glows of these blue ghost fireflies,
116.978	or a roadside river that I visited in Japan
119.998	as it was giving birth to the slow, floating flashes
124.104	of these Genji fireflies,
126.735	or in Malaysia, the mangrove trees
129.297	that I watched blossom nightly
131.625	not with flowers
133.055	but with the lights of a thousand — 
133.055	(Bleep! Bleep!) — fireflies,
135.923	all blinking together
137.253	in stunning synchrony.
140.411	These luminous landscapes
142.507	still fill me with wonder,
144.899	and they keep me connected to the magic
147.419	of the natural world.
149.827	And I find it amazing that they're created
151.443	by these tiny insects.
154.731	In person, fireflies are charming.
157.622	They're charismatic.
159.435	They've been celebrated in art
161.119	and in poetry for centuries.
163.594	As I've traveled around the world,
164.992	I've met many thoughtful people
167.01	who have told me that God put fireflies on Earth
169.839	for humans to enjoy.
171.99	Other creatures can enjoy them too.
174.386	I think these graceful insects are truly miraculous
178.715	because they so beautifully illuminate
182.72	the creative improvisation of evolution.
186.951	They've been shaped by two powerful
188.761	evolutionary forces:
190.292	natural selection, the struggle for survival,
193.952	and sexual selection,
196.101	the struggle for reproductive opportunity.
200.162	As a firefly junkie, the past 20 years
202.513	have been quite an exciting ride.
204.999	Together with my students at Tufts University
207.496	and other colleagues,
208.512	we've made lots of new discoveries about fireflies:
212.119	their courtship and sex lives,
214.128	their treachery and murder.
217.022	So today I'd like to share with you
218.839	just a couple of tales that we've brought back
221.31	from our collective adventures
223.788	into this hidden world.
227.498	Fireflies belong to a very beautiful
230.66	and diverse group of insects, the beetles.
234.898	Worldwide, there are more than 2,000 firefly species,
239.511	and these have evolved remarkably diverse
241.671	courtship signals,
243.026	that is, different ways to find and attract mates.
246.66	Around 150 million years ago,
248.916	the very first fireflies probably looked like this.
252.045	They flew during the daytime
253.402	and they didn't light up.
255.665	Instead, males used their fantastic antennae
258.838	to sniff out perfumes given off by their females.
262.949	In other fireflies, it's only the females who light up.
266.555	They are attractively plump and wingless,
270.897	so every night, they climb up onto perches
272.821	and they glow brightly for hours
274.789	to attract their flying but unlit males.
279.98	In still other fireflies, both sexes
281.83	use quick, bright flashes to find their mates.
285.217	Here in North America,
286.688	we have more than 100 different kinds of firefly
289.829	that have the remarkable ability to shine energy
293.406	out from their bodies
295.644	in the form of light.
297.97	How do they do that?
300.42	It seems totally magical,
302.453	but these bioluminescent signals
303.736	arise from carefully orchestrated chemical reactions
307.04	that happen inside the firefly lantern.
309.934	The main star is an enzyme called luciferase,
313.241	which in the course of evolution
314.996	has figured out a way to wrap its tiny arms
318.19	around an even smaller molecule called luciferin,
321.78	in the process getting it so excited
324.457	that it actually gives off light.
327.831	Incredible.
329.506	But how could these bright lights
331.334	have benefited some proto-firefly?
335.479	To answer this question, we need to flip back
337.589	in the family album to some baby pictures.
341.953	Fireflies completely reinvent
341.953	their bodies as they grow.
345.665	They spend the vast majority of their lifetime,
347.966	up to two years,
349.709	in this larval form.
352.57	Their main goal here, like my teenagers,
354.823	is to eat and grow.
357.978	And firefly light first originated
360.43	in these juveniles.
362.477	Every single firefly larva can light up,
364.907	even when their adults can't.
367.786	But what's the point
368.878	to being so conspicuous?
372.515	Well, we know that these juveniles
374.133	make nasty-tasting chemicals
376.113	that help them survive their extended childhood,
379.731	so we think these lights first evolved as a warning,
383.561	"a neon sign that says, ""Toxic! Stay away!"""
388.12	to any would-be predators.
391.014	It took many millions of years
393.964	before these bright lights
395.363	evolved into a smart communication tool
397.901	that could be used not just to
397.901	ward off potential predators
400.916	but to bring in potential mates.
403.886	Driven now by sexual selection,
406.687	some adult fireflies
408.577	like this proud male
410.973	evolved a shiny new glow-in-the-dark lantern
414.765	that would let them take courtship
416.609	to a whole new level.
420.389	These adults only live a few weeks,
422.841	and now they're single-mindedly focused on sex,
427.757	that is, on propelling their genes
429.727	into the next firefly generation.
432.503	So we can follow this male out into the field
435.767	as he joins hundreds of other males
438.791	who are all showing off their new courtship signals.
443.169	It's amazing to think that the luminous displays
446.161	we admire
447.845	here and in fact everywhere around the world
450.28	are actually the silent love songs
454.476	of male fireflies.
457.453	They're flying and flashing their hearts out.
461.54	I still find it very romantic.
465.08	But meanwhile, where are all the females?
468.497	Well, they're lounging down below
470.092	surveying their options.
471.83	They have plenty of males to choose from,
473.758	and these females turn out to be very picky.
477.85	When a female sees a flash
480.215	from an especially attractive male,
482.862	she'll aim her lantern in his direction,
485.843	and give him a flash back.
488.37	"It's her ""come hither"" sign."
491.771	So he flies closer and he flashes again.
495.366	If she still likes him,
496.492	they'll strike up a conversation.
499.703	These creatures speak their love
502.395	in the language of light.
505.298	So what exactly do these females consider sexy?
510.195	We decided to conduct some firefly opinion polls
512.94	to find out.
514.702	When we tested females using blinking LED lights,
517.91	we discovered they prefer males
520.225	who give longer-lasting flashes.
524.28	(Laughter) (Applause)
527.891	I know you're wondering,
529.07	what gives these males their sex appeal?
532.273	Now we get to see what happens
533.648	when the lights go out.
536.209	The first thing we discovered
537.678	is that once a male and female hook up like this,
540.447	they stay together all night long,
543.192	and when we looked inside
544.419	to see what might be happening,
545.853	we discovered a surprising new twist
548.141	to firefly sex.
550.105	While they're mating,
551.275	the male is busy giving the female
553.079	not just his sperm
555.05	but also a nutrient-filled package
559.156	called a nuptial gift.
563.777	We can zoom in to look more closely
565.711	inside this mating pair.
567.274	We can actually see the gift —
568.967	it's shown here in red —
570.379	as it's being passed from the male to the female.
574.329	What makes this gift so valuable
577.464	is that it's packed with protein
579.32	that the female will use to provision her eggs.
583.781	So females are keeping their eyes on this prize
587.651	as they size up potential mates.
589.923	We discovered that females use male flash signals
592.792	to try to predict which males
594.839	have the biggest gifts to offer,
596.909	because this bling helps the female lay more eggs
601.746	and ultimately launch more of her own offspring
604.997	into the next generation.
609.687	So it's not all sweetness and light.
611.695	Firefly romance is risky.
614.466	For the most part, these adult fireflies
616.943	don't get eaten because like their juveniles
619.627	they can manufacture toxins that are repellent
622.563	to birds and other insectivores,
625.62	but somewhere along the line,
628.12	one particular group of fireflies
630.44	somehow lost the metabolic machinery
633.567	needed to make their own protective toxins.
637.37	This evolutionary flaw,
639.65	which was discovered by my colleague Tom Eisner,
642.356	has driven these fireflies
644.299	to take their bright lights out into the night
647.697	with treacherous intent.
651.38	"Dubbed ""femme fatales"""
653.01	by Jim Lloyd, another colleague,
655.495	these females have figured out how to target
658.413	the males of other firefly species.
662.224	So the hunt begins with the predator —
664.124	she's shown here in the lower left —
666.171	where she's sitting quietly
668.218	and eavesdropping on the courtship conversation
671.35	of her intended prey,
672.79	and here's how it might go.
674.803	"First the prey male flashes, ""Do you love me?"""
678.673	"His own female responds, ""Maybe."""
682.779	So then he flashes again.
685.605	But this time, the predator sneaks in a reply
689.158	that cleverly mimics exactly
689.158	what the other female just said.
694.834	She's not looking for love: she's looking for toxins.
699.3	If she's good, she can lure this male close enough
703.181	to reach out and grab him,
706.172	and he's not just a light snack.
708.613	Over the next hour, she slowly
711.448	exsanguinates this male
714.307	leaving behind just some gory remains.
718	Unable to make their own toxins,
720.751	these females resort to drinking the blood
723.088	of other fireflies to get these protective chemicals.
727.783	So a firefly vampire,
733.628	brought to you by natural selection.
737.98	We still have a lot to learn about fireflies,
741.161	but it looks like many stories will remain untold,
744.544	because around the world, firefly populations
746.973	are blinking out.
749.628	The main culprit: habitat loss.
752.216	Pretty much everywhere, the fields and forests,
754.702	the mangroves and meadows
754.702	that fireflies need to survive,
757.649	are giving way to development and to sprawl.
761.281	Here's another problem: we've conquered darkness,
765.47	but in the process, we spill so
765.47	much extra light out into the night
768.964	that it disrupts the lives of other creatures,
772.09	and fireflies are especially sensitive to light pollution
775.534	because it obscures the signals
778.155	that they use to find their mates.
782.614	Do we really need fireflies?
784.592	After all, they're just one tiny bit
786.631	of Earth's biodiversity.
788.9	Yet every time a species is lost,
792.208	it's like extinguishing a room full of candles
794.897	one by one.
797.825	You might not notice
798.771	when the first few flames flicker out,
802.061	but in the end, you're left sitting in darkness.
811.591	As we work together to craft a planetary future,
816.411	I hope we can find a way
818.875	to keep these bright lights shining.
822.328	Thank you.
824.364	(Applause)
