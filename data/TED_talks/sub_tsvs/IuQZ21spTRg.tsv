16.063	So little Billy goes to school,
18.847	and he sits down and the teacher says,
21.604	"""What does your father do?"""
24.609	"And little Billy says, ""My father plays the piano"
28.266	"in an opium den."""
31.372	So the teacher rings up the parents, and says,
33.361	"""Very shocking story from little Billy today."
36.615	Just heard that he claimed that you play the piano
40.364	"in an opium den."""
42.524	"And the father says, ""I'm very sorry. Yes, it's true, I lied."
46.383	But how can I tell an eight-year-old boy
50.014	"that his father is a politician?"" (Laughter)"
54.423	Now, as a politician myself, standing in front of you,
57.671	or indeed, meeting any stranger anywhere in the world,
61.326	when I eventually reveal the nature of my profession,
63.902	they look at me as though I'm somewhere between
66.996	a snake, a monkey and an iguana,
71.75	and through all of this, I feel, strongly,
75.692	that something is going wrong.
78.674	Four hundred years of maturing democracy,
81.87	colleagues in Parliament who seem to me, as individuals,
84.738	reasonably impressive, an increasingly educated,
88.316	energetic, informed population, and yet
92.963	a deep, deep sense of disappointment.
97.867	My colleagues in Parliament include, in my new intake,
101.839	family doctors, businesspeople, professors,
106.593	distinguished economists, historians, writers,
110.816	army officers ranging from colonels down to regimental sergeant majors.
115.818	All of them, however, including myself, as we walk underneath
119.479	those strange stone gargoyles just down the road,
123.587	feel that we've become less than the sum of our parts,
127.613	feel as though we have become profoundly diminished.
133.286	And this isn't just a problem in Britain.
137.414	It's a problem across the developing world,
140.147	and in middle income countries too. In Jamaica,
142.781	for example -- look at Jamaican members of Parliament,
146.089	you meet them, and they're often people who are
149.069	Rhodes Scholars, who've studied at Harvard or at Princeton,
154.513	and yet, you go down to downtown Kingston,
157.574	and you are looking at one of the most depressing sites
161.218	that you can see in any middle-income country in the world:
165.303	a dismal, depressing landscape
168.066	of burnt and half-abandoned buildings.
171.256	And this has been true for 30 years, and the handover
174.384	in 1979, 1980, between one Jamaican leader who was
178.65	the son of a Rhodes Scholar and a Q.C. to another
182.125	who'd done an economics doctorate at Harvard,
185.355	over 800 people were killed in the streets
188.358	in drug-related violence.
191.885	Ten years ago, however, the promise of democracy
195.367	seemed to be extraordinary. George W. Bush stood up
199.35	in his State of the Union address in 2003
202.51	and said that democracy was the force that would beat
206.539	most of the ills of the world. He said,
209.565	because democratic governments respect their own people
213.338	and respect their neighbors, freedom will bring peace.
219.072	Distinguished academics at the same time argued that
222.706	democracies had this incredible range of side benefits.
226.384	They would bring prosperity, security,
229.684	overcome sectarian violence,
232.505	ensure that states would never again harbor terrorists.
236.97	Since then, what's happened?
239.324	Well, what we've seen is the creation, in places like Iraq
242.518	and Afghanistan, of democratic systems of government
246.506	which haven't had any of those side benefits.
249.396	In Afghanistan, for example, we haven't just had one election
252.389	or two elections. We've gone through three elections,
255.056	presidential and parliamentary. And what do we find?
258.183	Do we find a flourishing civil society, a vigorous rule of law
261.794	and good security? No. What we find in Afghanistan
265.255	is a judiciary that is weak and corrupt,
269.4	a very limited civil society which is largely ineffective,
273.585	a media which is beginning to get onto its feet
276.589	but a government that's deeply unpopular,
279.414	perceived as being deeply corrupt, and security
283.182	that is shocking, security that's terrible.
286.995	In Pakistan, in lots of sub-Saharan Africa,
291.653	again you can see democracy and elections are compatible
294.645	with corrupt governments, with states that are unstable
298.494	and dangerous.
301.351	And when I have conversations with people, I remember
303.635	having a conversation, for example, in Iraq,
306.516	with a community that asked me
309.205	whether the riot we were seeing in front of us,
312.715	this was a huge mob ransacking a provincial council building,
316.538	was a sign of the new democracy.
321.23	The same, I felt, was true in almost every single one
325.371	of the middle and developing countries that I went to,
328.319	and to some extent the same is true of us.
332.37	Well, what is the answer to this? Is the answer to just
334.946	give up on the idea of democracy?
337.604	Well, obviously not. It would be absurd
341.346	if we were to engage again in the kind of operations
344.133	we were engaged in, in Iraq and Afghanistan
347.209	if we were to suddenly find ourselves in a situation
350.729	in which we were imposing
353.404	anything other than a democratic system.
355.843	Anything else would run contrary to our values,
358.395	it would run contrary to the wishes of the people
360.646	on the ground, it would run contrary to our interests.
364.269	I remember in Iraq, for example, that we went through
367.576	a period of feeling that we should delay democracy.
370.117	We went through a period of feeling that the lesson learned
372.809	from Bosnia was that elections held too early
376.387	enshrined sectarian violence, enshrined extremist parties,
380.621	so in Iraq in 2003 the decision was made,
383.439	let's not have elections for two years. Let's invest in
386.556	voter education. Let's invest in democratization.
390.728	The result was that I found stuck outside my office
394.746	a huge crowd of people, this is actually a photograph
396.918	taken in Libya but I saw the same scene in Iraq
400.398	of people standing outside screaming for the elections,
404.523	"and when I went out and said, ""What is wrong"
407.289	with the interim provincial council?
410.249	What is wrong with the people that we have chosen?
413.917	There is a Sunni sheikh, there's a Shiite sheikh,
416.662	there's the seven -- leaders of the seven major tribes,
419.813	there's a Christian, there's a Sabian,
422.367	there are female representatives, there's every political party in this council,
426.611	"what's wrong with the people that we chose?"""
429.251	"The answer came, ""The problem isn't the people"
432.349	"that you chose. The problem is that you chose them."""
438.15	I have not met, in Afghanistan, in even the most
441.582	remote community, anybody who does not want
444.709	a say in who governs them.
447.493	Most remote community, I have never met a villager
449.554	who does not want a vote.
453.136	So we need to acknowledge
456.416	that despite the dubious statistics, despite the fact that
465.421	despite the fact that when I was in Iraq, we did an opinion poll
468.393	in 2003 and asked people what political systems they preferred,
472.651	and the answer came back that
474.975	seven percent wanted the United States,
478.036	five percent wanted France,
480.759	three percent wanted Britain,
483.414	and nearly 40 percent wanted Dubai, which is, after all,
487.769	not a democratic state at all but a relatively prosperous
490.535	minor monarchy, democracy is a thing of value
495.238	for which we should be fighting. But in order to do so
498.4	we need to get away from instrumental arguments.
501.752	We need to get away from saying democracy matters
505.32	because of the other things it brings.
508.427	We need to get away from feeling, in the same way,
510.552	human rights matters because of the other things it brings,
514.149	or women's rights matters for the other things it brings.
517.841	Why should we get away from those arguments?
520.145	Because they're very dangerous. If we set about saying,
522.549	for example, torture is wrong because it doesn't extract
527.242	good information, or we say, you need women's rights
532.44	because it stimulates economic growth by doubling the size of the work force,
537.12	you leave yourself open to the position where
538.777	the government of North Korea can turn around and say,
540.87	"""Well actually, we're having a lot of success extracting"
543.733	"good information with our torture at the moment,"""
546.234	"or the government of Saudi Arabia to say, ""Well,"
548.194	our economic growth's okay, thank you very much,
549.923	considerably better than yours,
551.383	"so maybe we don't need to go ahead with this program on women's rights."""
556.189	The point about democracy is not instrumental.
559.87	It's not about the things that it brings.
562.659	The point about democracy is not that it delivers
565.224	legitimate, effective, prosperous rule of law.
571.468	It's not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors.
576.113	The point about democracy is intrinsic.
579.03	Democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality
584.361	and an idea of liberty. It reflects an idea of dignity,
588.769	the dignity of the individual, the idea that each individual
592.639	should have an equal vote, an equal say,
596.24	in the formation of their government.
600.235	But if we're really to make democracy vigorous again,
604.301	if we're ready to revivify it, we need to get involved
606.914	in a new project of the citizens and the politicians.
611.715	Democracy is not simply a question of structures.
616.103	It is a state of mind. It is an activity.
620.12	And part of that activity is honesty.
623.911	After I speak to you today, I'm going on a radio program
627.449	"called ""Any Questions,"" and the thing you will have noticed"
629.752	about politicians on these kinds of radio programs
633.552	is that they never, ever say that they don't know the answer
637.017	to a question. It doesn't matter what it is.
638.652	If you ask about child tax credits, the future of the penguins
642.004	in the south Antarctic, asked to hold forth on whether or not
646.626	the developments in Chongqing contribute
649.258	to sustainable development in carbon capture,
651.592	and we will have an answer for you.
654.354	We need to stop that, to stop pretending to be
657.539	omniscient beings.
659.424	Politicians also need to learn, occasionally, to say that
662.984	certain things that voters want, certain things that voters
666.73	have been promised, may be things
670.593	that we cannot deliver
673.738	or perhaps that we feel we should not deliver.
677.52	And the second thing we should do is understand
680.411	the genius of our societies.
683.403	Our societies have never been so educated, have never
687.432	been so energized, have never been so healthy,
690.368	have never known so much, cared so much,
693.316	or wanted to do so much, and it is a genius of the local.
699.212	One of the reasons why we're moving away
701.91	from banqueting halls such as the one in which we stand,
705.411	banqueting halls with extraordinary images on the ceiling
709.887	of kings enthroned,
711.662	the entire drama played out here on this space,
714.814	where the King of England had his head lopped off,
717.673	why we've moved from spaces like this, thrones like that,
722.004	towards the town hall, is we're moving more and more
725.729	towards the energies of our people, and we need to tap that.
729.677	That can mean different things in different countries.
732.467	In Britain, it could mean looking to the French,
735.78	learning from the French,
737.523	getting directly elected mayors in place
741.152	in a French commune system.
743.64	In Afghanistan, it could have meant instead of concentrating
746.474	on the big presidential and parliamentary elections,
749.028	we should have done what was in the Afghan constitution
751.345	from the very beginning, which is to get direct local elections going
756.025	at a district level and elect people's provincial governors.
761.572	But for any of these things to work,
764.295	the honesty in language, the local democracy,
767.118	it's not just a question of what politicians do.
769.886	It's a question of what the citizens do.
771.954	For politicians to be honest, the public needs to allow them to be honest,
776.861	and the media, which mediates between the politicians
779.44	and the public, needs to allow those politicians to be honest.
784.071	If local democracy is to flourish, it is about the active
787.693	and informed engagement of every citizen.
791.929	In other words, if democracy is to be rebuilt,
796.33	is to become again vigorous and vibrant,
800.654	it is necessary not just for the public
803.8	to learn to trust their politicians,
806.714	but for the politicians to learn to trust the public.
811.586	Thank you very much indeed. (Applause)
