12.879	Today, I am going to show you
14.905	how this tablet and this virtual-reality
14.905	headset that I'm wearing
19.358	are going to completely
19.358	revolutionize science education.
24.1	And I'm also going to show you
25.919	how it can make any science teacher
25.919	more than twice as effective.
31.124	But before I show you
31.124	how all of this is possible,
34.612	let's talk briefly about why improving
34.612	the quality of science education
40.175	is so vitally important.
43.513	If you think about it,
44.698	the world is growing incredibly fast.
47.322	And with that growth comes
47.322	a whole list of growing challenges,
51.231	challenges such as dealing
51.231	with global warming,
54.268	solving starvation and water shortages
56.655	and curing diseases,
58.131	to name just a few.
60.402	And who, exactly, is going to help us
60.402	solve all of these great challenges?
66.733	Well, to a very last degree,
66.733	it is these young students.
70.194	This is the next generation
70.194	of young, bright scientists.
74.06	And in many ways, we all rely on them
77.104	for coming up with new, great innovations
79.93	to help us solve all
79.93	these challenges ahead of us.
84.708	And so a couple of years back,
86.683	my cofounder and I were teaching
86.683	university students just like these,
91.066	only the students we were teaching
91.066	looked a little bit more like this here.
96.204	(Laughter)
97.292	And yes, this is really
97.292	the reality out there
100.154	in way too many universities
100.154	around the world:
103.703	students that are bored, disengaged
106.38	and sometimes not even sure
106.38	why they're learning about a topic
110.009	in the first place.
111.763	So we started looking around for new,
111.763	innovative teaching methods,
116.121	but what we found was quite disappointing.
118.968	We saw that books were being
118.968	turned into e-books,
123.495	blackboards were being turned
123.495	into YouTube videos
126.535	and lecture hall monologues
126.535	were being turned into MOOCs --
129.703	massive online open courses.
132.694	And if you think about it,
133.965	all we're really doing here
133.965	is taking the same content
137.572	and the same format,
139.144	and bringing it out to more students --
142.565	which is great, don't get me
142.565	wrong, that is really great --
145.427	but the teaching method
145.427	is still more or less the same,
149.078	no real innovation there.
151.863	So we started looking elsewhere.
153.906	What we found was that flight simulators
153.906	had been proven over and over again
158.557	to be far more effective
160.048	when used in combination with real,
160.048	in-flight training to train the pilots.
165.338	And so we thought to ourselves:
167.532	Why not just apply that to science?
169.893	Why not build a virtual
169.893	laboratory simulator?
175.563	Well, we did it.
176.835	We basically set out to create
178.677	a fully simulated, one-to-one,
178.677	virtual reality laboratory simulator,
184.316	where the students
184.316	could perform experiments
186.537	with mathematical equations
188.471	that would simulate what would
188.471	happen in a real-world lab.
191.714	But not just simple simulations --
193.417	we would also create advanced simulations
195.507	with top universities like MIT,
197.455	to bring out cutting-edge cancer
197.455	research to these students.
202.52	And suddenly, the universities
202.52	could save millions of dollars
205.427	by letting the students
205.427	perform virtual experiments
208.381	before they go into the real laboratory.
212.303	And not only that; now,
212.303	they could also understand --
214.859	even on a molecular level
214.859	inside the machine --
217.316	what is happening to the machines.
220.016	And then they could suddenly perform
221.939	dangerous experiments in the labs as well.
224.591	For instance also here,
226.101	learning about salmonella bacteria,
226.101	which is an important topic
229.737	that many schools cannot teach
229.737	for good safety reasons.
234.315	And we, of course, quiz the students
236.076	and then give the teachers
236.076	a full dashboard,
238.505	so they fully understand
238.505	where the students are at.
242.134	But we didn't stop there,
243.366	because we had seen just
243.366	how important meaning is
245.715	for the students' engagement in the class.
248.025	So we brought in game designers
249.771	to create fun and engaging stories.
252.676	For instance, here in this case,
254.534	where the students have to solve
254.534	a mysterious CSI murder case
258.681	using their core science skills.
263.861	And the feedback we got
263.861	when we launched all of this
266.329	was quite overwhelmingly positive.
268.305	Here we have 300 students,
270.132	all passionately solving CSI murder cases
272.871	while learning core science skills.
274.76	And what I love the most about this
277.029	is really when the students
277.029	come up to me sometimes afterwards,
280.697	all surprised and a little confused,
282.836	"and say, ""I just spent two hours"
282.836	in this virtual lab,
288.432	"and ... and I didn't check Facebook."""
290.635	(Laughter)
291.988	That's how engaging and immersive
291.988	this really is for the students.
296.663	And so, to investigate
296.663	whether this really worked,
299.507	a learning psychologist
299.507	did a study with 160 students --
303.934	that was from Stanford University
303.934	and Technical University of Denmark.
308.204	And what they did is split
308.204	the students into two groups.
311.76	One group would only use
311.76	the virtual laboratory simulations,
316.035	the other group would only use
316.035	traditional teaching methods,
319.759	and they had the same amount of time.
322.801	Then, interestingly,
323.977	they gave the students a test
323.977	before and after the experiment,
327.668	so they could clearly measure
327.668	the learning impact of the students.
332.045	And what they found
333.237	was a surprisingly high 76 percent
333.237	increase in the learning effectiveness
339.062	when using virtual laboratories
339.062	over traditional teaching methods.
344.349	But even more interestingly,
345.858	the second part of this study investigated
349.096	what the teacher's impact
349.096	was on the learning.
352.024	And what they found
353.199	was that when you combined
353.199	the virtual laboratories
355.885	with teacher-led coaching and mentoring,
358.513	then we saw a total 101 percent
358.513	increase in the learning effectiveness,
364.353	which effectively doubles
364.353	the science teacher's impact
368.809	with the same amount of time spent.
373.784	So a couple of months back,
376.518	we started asking ourselves --
378.055	we have a wonderful team now
378.055	of learning psychologists
380.626	and teachers and scientists
380.626	and game developers --
383.006	and we started asking ourselves:
384.571	How can we keep ourselves to our promise
387.19	of constantly reimagining education?
390.178	And today, I am really excited
390.178	to be presenting what we came up with
395.303	and have been working
395.303	incredibly hard to create.
400.228	I will explain briefly what this is.
402.885	Basically, I take my mobile phone --
405.645	most students already
405.645	have these, smartphones --
408.375	and I plug it into this virtual-reality
408.375	headset, a low-cost headset.
412.923	And now what I can effectively do is,
414.916	I can literally step
414.916	into this virtual world.
418.09	We'll have some of you
418.09	in the audience also get to try this,
421.198	because it is really something
421.198	that you have to try
424.378	to fully feel how immersive it really is.
426.697	It literally feels like I just stepped
426.697	inside this virtual lab.
430.498	Do you see me up on the screen?
432.025	Audience: Yes.
433.2	Michael Bodekaer: Great! Awesome.
434.827	So basically, I have just
434.827	turned my mobile phone
437.749	into a fully simulated, million-dollar
437.749	Ivy League laboratory
441.437	with all this amazing equipment
441.437	that I can interact with.
444.286	I can, for instance, pick up the pipette
444.286	and do experiments with it.
447.683	I have my E-Ggel, my PCR
447.683	and -- oh, look there,
450.127	I have my next-generation
450.127	sequencing machine,
452.672	and there I even have
452.672	my electron microscope.
456.194	I mean, who's carrying around
456.194	an electron microscope in their pocket?
459.648	And here I have my machine,
461.544	I can do different experiments
461.544	on the machine.
463.738	And over here I have the door,
465.216	I can go into other experiments,
467.608	I can perform in the laboratories.
469.565	And here, I have my learning tablet.
471.795	This is an intelligent tablet
473.273	that allows me to read
473.273	about relevant theory.
476.145	As you can see, I can interact with it.
478.471	I can watch videos and see
478.471	content that is relevant
482.389	to the experiment
482.389	that I'm performing right now.
486.074	Then over here, I have Marie.
487.501	She is my teacher --
487.501	my lab assistant --
491.044	and what she does is guides me
491.044	through this whole laboratory.
494.245	And very soon,
495.428	the teachers will be able
495.428	to literally teleport themselves
498.42	into this virtual world
498.42	that I'm in right now
501.003	and help me, guide me,
501.003	through this whole experiment.
504.257	And now before I finalize this,
506.591	I want to show you
506.591	an even cooler thing, I think --
509.583	something you cannot
509.583	even do in real laboratories.
512.643	This is a PCR machine.
513.905	I'm now going to start this experiment.
516.409	And what I just did is literally
516.409	shrunk myself a million times
520.666	into the size of a molecule --
522.249	and it really feels like it,
522.249	you have to try this.
524.622	So now it feels like
524.622	I'm standing inside the machine
527.249	and I'm seeing all the DNA,
527.249	and I see the molecules.
529.866	I see the polymerase
529.866	and the enzymes and so forth.
533.493	And I can see how in this case,
535.12	DNA is being replicated millions of times,
538.221	just like it's happening
538.221	inside your body right now.
541.078	And I can really feel and understand
541.078	how all of this works.
546.219	Now, I hope that gives you
546.219	a little bit of a sense
549.537	of the possibilities
549.537	in these new teaching methods.
556.23	And I want to also emphasize
557.596	that everything you just saw
557.596	also works on iPads and laptops
561.311	without the headsets.
562.506	I say that for a very important reason.
565.394	In order for us to really
565.394	empower and inspire
568.903	the next generation of scientists,
571.095	we really need teachers
571.095	to drive the adoption
574.643	of new technologies in the classroom.
578.542	And so in many ways,
580.444	I believe that the next big,
580.444	quantum leap in science education
584.823	lies no longer with the technology,
587.156	but rather with the teachers' decision
589.061	to push forward and adopt
589.061	these technologies
592.29	inside the classrooms.
594.061	And so it is our hope that more
594.061	universities and schools and teachers
597.922	will collaborate with technology companies
600.811	to realize this full potential.
604.989	And so,
606.458	lastly, I'd like to leave you
606.458	with a little story
609.315	that really inspires me.
610.901	And that is the story of Jack Andraka.
613.346	Some of you might already know him.
615.132	Jack invented a new, groundbreaking
615.132	low-cost test for pancreatic cancer
622.148	at the age 15.
625.758	And when Jack shares his story
625.758	of how he did this huge breakthrough,
629.521	he also explains that one thing
629.521	almost prevented him
633.37	from making this breakthrough.
635.543	And that was that he did not
635.543	have access to real laboratories,
640.627	because he was too inexperienced
643.18	to be allowed in.
645.853	Now, imagine if we could bring
648.079	Ivy League, million-dollar
648.079	virtual laboratories
651.372	out to all these students just like Jack,
653.467	all over the world,
655.098	and give them the latest, greatest,
655.098	most fancy machines you can imagine
658.678	that would quite literally
658.678	make any scientist in here
661.248	jump up and down out of pure excitement.
663.745	And then imagine how that
663.745	would empower and inspire
668.379	a whole new generation
668.379	of young and bright scientists,
672.582	ready to innovate and change the world.
676.187	Thank you very much.
677.362	(Applause)
