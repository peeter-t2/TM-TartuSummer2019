13.552	This man is wearing what we call
16.266	a bee beard. (Laughter)
19.036	A beard full of bees.
20.485	Now, this is what many of you might picture
23.728	when you think about honeybees, maybe insects,
26.701	or maybe anything that has more legs than two.
29.789	And let me start by telling you, I gotcha.
32.447	I understand that. But, there are many things to know,
36.928	and I want you to open your minds here,
39.608	keep them open, and change your perspective about honeybees.
43.098	Notice that this man is not getting stung.
46.063	He probably has a queen bee tied to his chin,
49.507	and the other bees are attracted to it.
51.626	So this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees,
55.662	and that goes deep back for thousands of years.
59.43	We're very co-evolved, because we depend on bees
62.592	for pollination and, even more recently,
65.552	as an economic commodity.
67.376	Many of you may have heard that honeybees are disappearing,
70.176	not just dying, but they're gone.
72.753	We don't even find dead bodies.
74.555	This is called colony collapse disorder,
76.926	and it's bizarre. Researchers around the globe
79.138	still do not know what's causing it,
81.584	but what we do know is that, with the declining numbers
84.154	of bees, the costs of over 130 fruit and vegetable crops
88.391	that we rely on for food is going up in price.
93.398	So honeybees are important for their role in the economy
97.156	as well as in agriculture.
99.181	Here you can see some pictures of what are called
101	green roofs, or urban agriculture.
103.689	We're familiar with the image on the left that shows
105.967	a local neighborhood garden in the South End.
108.751	That's where I call home. I have a beehive in the backyard.
111.542	And perhaps a green roof in the future,
113.961	when we're further utilizing urban areas,
115.892	where there are stacks of garden spaces.
119.35	Check out this image above the orange line in Boston.
122.703	Try to spot the beehive. It's there.
126.18	It's on the rooftop, right on the corner there,
128.877	and it's been there for a couple of years now.
131.27	The way that urban beekeeping currently operates
134.522	is that the beehives are quite hidden,
137.113	and it's not because they need to be.
139.14	It's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea,
142.117	and that's why I want you today to try to think about this,
145.791	think about the benefits of bees in cities
148.074	and why they really are a terrific thing.
150.333	Let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works.
153.303	So we know flowers, we know fruits and vegetables,
155.886	even some alfalfa in hay that the livestock
159.092	for the meats that we eat, rely on pollinators,
161.555	but you've got male and female parts to a plant here,
164.988	and basically pollinators are attracted to plants
167.878	for their nectar, and in the process,
170.905	a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen,
174.28	or that male kind of sperm counterpart, along the way,
177.712	and then travel to different flowers, and eventually
180.33	an apple, in this case, will be produced.
183.449	You can see the orientation. The stem is down.
185.716	The blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it,
188.67	but that's a basic overview of how pollination works.
191.528	And let's think about urban living, not today,
194.4	and not in the past, but what about in a hundred years?
197.265	What's it gonna look like? We have huge grand challenges
201.203	these days of habitat loss. We have more and more people,
205.133	billions of people, in 100 years, God knows how many people,
208.494	and how little space there will be to fit all of them,
211.858	so we need to change the way that we see cities, and
215.28	looking at this picture on the left of New York City today,
218.643	you can see how gray and brown it is.
220.51	We have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back
224.041	into the atmosphere,
226.077	contributing to global climate change, no doubt.
228.412	What about in 100 years, if we have green rooftops
230.912	everywhere, and gardening, and we create our own crops
234.075	right in the cities? We save on the costs of transportation,
237.878	we save on a healthier diet, and we also educate
241.974	and create new jobs locally.
243.676	We need bees for the future of our cities and urban living.
248.342	Here's some data that we collected through our company
251.726	with Best Bees, where we deliver, install and manage
254.628	honeybee hives for anybody who wants them,
256.871	in the city, in the countryside, and we introduce honeybees,
260.388	and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop
263.247	or fire escape, for even that matter,
265.728	and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is.
268.502	There's a counterintuitive trend that we noticed
270.634	in these numbers. So let's look at the first metric here,
274.077	overwintering survival.
275.477	Now this has been a huge problem for many years,
278.302	basically since the late 1980s, when the varroa mite came
282.362	and brought many different viruses, bacteria
285.738	and fungal diseases with it.
287.542	Overwintering success is hard,
289.291	and that's when most of the colonies are lost,
291.584	and we found that in the cities, bees are surviving
294.25	better than they are in the country.
296.598	A bit counterintuitive, right?
298.826	We think, oh, bees, countryside, agriculture,
300.908	but that's not what the bees are showing.
303.135	The bees like it in the city. (Laughter)
305.284	Furthermore, they also produce more honey.
308.431	The urban honey is delicious.
311	The bees in Boston on the rooftop of the Seaport Hotel,
314.097	where we have hundreds of thousands of bees
316.569	flying overheard right now
318.072	that I'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by,
320.377	are going to all of the local community gardens
322.687	and making delicious, healthy honey
325.086	that just tastes like the flowers in our city.
328.114	So the yield for urban hives, in terms of honey production,
332.901	is higher as well as the overwintering survival,
336.016	compared to rural areas.
337.39	Again, a bit counterintuitive.
339.392	And looking back historically at the timeline
342.713	of honeybee health, we can go back to the year 950 and see
346.989	that there was also a great mortality of bees in Ireland.
350.037	So the problems of bees today isn't necessarily
353.188	something new. It has been happening
355.813	since over a thousand years ago,
357.88	but what we don't really notice are these problems in cities.
361.577	So one thing I want to encourage you to think about
363.605	is the idea of what an urban island is.
366.007	You think in the city maybe the temperature's warmer.
369.403	Why are bees doing better in the city?
370.982	This is a big question now to help us understand
373.654	why they should be in the city.
375.975	Perhaps there's more pollen in the city.
377.997	With the trains coming in to urban hubs, they can
380.213	carry pollen with them, very light pollen,
382.792	and it's just a big supermarket in the city.
385.129	A lot of linden trees live along the railroad tracks.
388.956	Perhaps there are fewer pesticides in the cities
391.722	than there are in [rural] areas.
393.94	Perhaps there are other things that we're just not thinking about yet,
396.792	but that's one idea to think about, urban islands.
399.399	And colony collapse disorder is not the only thing
403.323	affecting honeybees. Honeybees are dying,
406.225	and it's a huge, huge grand challenge of our time.
409.929	What you can see up here is a map of the world,
412.401	and we're tracking the spread of this varroa mite.
415.473	Now, the varroa mite is what changed the game
418.161	in beekeeping, and you can see, at the top right,
421.016	the years are changing, we're coming up to modern times,
424.279	and you can see the spread of the varroa mite
426.609	from the early 1900s through now.
429.26	It's 1968, and we're pretty much covering Asia.
436.273	and then, when we get to the 1980s,
440.661	and specifically to 1987, the varroa mite finally came
444.895	to North America and to the United States,
447.277	and that is when the game changed
449.733	for honeybees in the United States.
452.414	Many of us will remember our childhood growing up,
454.502	maybe you got stung by a bee, you saw bees on flowers.
456.728	Think of the kids today. Their childhood's a bit different.
460.666	They don't experience this.
462.59	The bees just aren't around anymore.
465.09	So we need bees and they're disappearing and it's a big problem.
468.53	What can we do here?
470.235	So, what I do is honeybee research.
472.8	I got my Ph.D. studying honeybee health.
474.893	I started in 2005 studying honeybees.
478.358	In 2006, honeybees started disappearing,
480.7	so suddenly, like, this little nerd kid
483.061	going to school working with bugs — (Laughter) —
485.678	became very relevant in the world.
487.771	And it worked out that way.
488.852	So my research focuses on ways to make bees healthier.
492.851	I don't research what's killing the bees, per se.
495.642	I'm not one of the many researchers around the world
497.825	who's looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases
500.896	or habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees.
503.448	We're looking at ways to make bees healthier
505.441	through vaccines, through yogurt, like probiotics,
509.072	and other types of therapies in ways that can be fed orally to bees,
513.872	and this process is so easy, even a 7-year-old can do it.
516.907	You just mix up some pollen, sugar and water,
519.267	and whatever active ingredient you want to put in,
521.069	and you just give it right to the bees. No chemicals involved,
523.267	just immune boosters.
525.437	Humans think about our own health in a prospective way.
527.637	We exercise, we eat healthy, we take vitamins.
530.297	Why don't we think about honeybees in that same type of way?
533.34	Bring them to areas where they're thriving
535.906	and try to make them healthier before they get sick.
539.342	I spent many years in grad school trying to poke bees and do vaccines
543.531	with needles. (Laughter) Like, years,
546.873	"years at the bench, ""Oh my gosh, it's 3 a.m."
549.175	"and I'm still pricking bees."" (Laughter)"
550.526	"And then one day I said, ""Why don't we just do an oral vaccine?"""
554.4	"It's like, ""Ugh,"" so that's what we do. (Laughter)"
559.048	I'd love to share with you some images of urban beehives,
562.236	because they can be anything.
564.718	I mean, really open your mind with this.
566.621	You can paint a hive to match your home.
568.795	You can hide a hive inside your home.
572.165	These are three hives on the rooftop
573.977	of the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel,
576.088	and they're beautiful here. I mean, we matched
578.548	the new color of the inside of their rooms to do
581.229	some type of a stained wood with blue for their sheets,
584.466	and these bees are terrific, and they also will use
587.485	herbs that are growing in the garden.
590.091	That's what the chefs go to to use for their cooking,
593.19	and the honey -- they do live events --
595.069	they'll use that honey at their bars.
597.207	Honey is a great nutritional substitute for regular sugar
599.827	because there are different types of sugars in there.
601.954	We also have a classroom hives project,
604.331	where -- this is a nonprofit venture --
606.983	we're spreading the word around the world for how
610.1	honeybee hives can be taken into the classroom
612.385	or into the museum setting, behind glass,
614.691	and used as an educational tool.
617.099	This hive that you see here has been
618.723	in Fenway High School for many years now.
621.274	The bees fly right into the outfield of Fenway Park.
623.233	Nobody notices it. If you're not a flower,
625.188	these bees do not care about you. (Laughter)
627.809	They don't. They don't. They'll say,
630.18	"""S'cuse me, flying around."" (Laughter)"
633.091	Some other images here in telling a part of the story
635.654	that really made urban beekeeping terrific is
638.292	in New York City, beekeeping was illegal until 2010.
641.656	That's a big problem, because what's going to pollinate
644.993	all of the gardens and the produce locally? Hands?
648.417	I mean, locally in Boston, there is a terrific company
651.773	called Green City Growers, and they are going
654.178	and pollinating their squash crops by hand with Q-Tips,
657.689	and if they miss that three day window, there's no fruit.
660.243	Their clients aren't happy, and people go hungry.
663.146	So this is important.
665.014	We have also some images of honey from Brooklyn.
667.121	Now, this was a mystery in the New York Times
669.073	where the honey was very red, and the
670.921	New York State forensics department came in
672.445	and they actually did some science to match
675.047	the red dye with that found
677.567	in a maraschino cherry factory down the street. (Laughter)
680.818	So you can tailor your honey to taste however you want
684.216	by planting bee-friendly flowers.
686.511	Paris has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping.
689.249	They've had hives on the rooftop of their opera house
691.799	for many years now, and that's what really got people started, thinking,
694.735	"""Wow, we can do this, and we should do this."""
698.203	Also in London, and in Europe across the board,
701.036	they're very advanced in their use of green rooftops
704.288	and integrating beehives,
706.786	and I'll show you an ending note here.
709.967	I would like to encourage you to open your mind.
712.042	What can you do to save the bees or to help them
715.203	or to think of sustainable cities in the future?
718.994	Well, really, just change your perspective.
720.964	Try to understand that bees are very important.
722.938	A bee isn't going to sting you if you see it.
725.349	The bee dies. Honeybees die when they sting,
728.663	so they don't want to do it either. (Laughter)
731.105	It's nothing to panic about. They're all over the city.
735.195	You could even get your own hive if you want.
737.297	There are great resources available,
739.025	and there are even companies that will help get you set up and mentor you
741.981	and it's important for our educational system in the world
745.107	for students to learn about agriculture worldwide
747.793	such as this little girl, who, again, is not even getting stung.
751.628	Thank you. (Applause)
