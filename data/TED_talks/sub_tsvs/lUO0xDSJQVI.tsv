12.772	Today I'm here, actually,
12.772	to pose you a question.
15.876	What is life?
17.56	It has been really puzzling me
17.56	for more than 25 years,
21.247	and will probably continue doing so
21.247	for the next 25 years.
25.594	This is the thesis I did
25.594	when I was still in undergraduate school.
31.255	While my colleagues still treated
31.255	computers as big calculators,
38.221	I started to teach computers to learn.
41.381	I built digital lady beetles
44.788	and tried to learn from real lady beetles,
44.788	just to do one thing:
49.399	search for food.
51.141	And after very simple neural network --
53.939	genetic algorithms and so on --
56.234	look at the pattern.
57.615	They're almost identical to real life.
61.797	A very striking learning experience
61.797	for a twenty-year-old.
67.423	Life is a learning program.
72.079	When you look
72.079	at all of this wonderful world,
75.636	every species has
75.636	its own learning program.
79.405	The learning program is genome,
82.19	and the code of that program is DNA.
86.977	The different genomes of each species
86.977	represent different survival strategies.
93.438	They represent hundreds of millions
93.438	of years of evolution.
98.699	The interaction between
98.699	every species' ancestor
102.515	and the environment.
105.97	I was really fascinated about the world,
108.433	about the DNA,
109.639	about, you know, the language of life,
112.606	the program of learning.
114.587	So I decided to co-found
114.587	the institute to read them.
119.344	I read many of them.
121.409	We probably read more than half
121.409	of the prior animal genomes in the world.
126.135	I mean, up to date.
129.263	We did learn a lot.
131.117	We did sequence, also,
131.117	one species many, many times ...
135.009	human genome.
136.192	We sequenced the first Asian.
137.978	I sequenced it myself many, many times,
140.84	just to take advantage of that platform.
144.788	Look at all those repeating base pairs:
147.718	ATCG.
149.21	You don't understand anything there.
151.148	But look at that one base pair.
152.766	Those five letters, the AGGAA.
155.704	These five SNPs represent
155.704	a very specific haplotype
159.205	in the Tibetan population
161.07	around the gene called EPAS1.
163.093	That gene has been proved --
164.848	it's highly selective --
166.135	it's the most significant signature
166.135	of positive selection of Tibetans
170.506	for the higher altitude adaptation.
172.922	You know what?
174.16	These five SNPs were the result
174.16	of integration of Denisovans,
179.971	or Denisovan-like individuals into humans.
184.049	This is the reason
184.049	why we need to read those genomes.
186.604	To understand history,
188.009	to understand what kind
188.009	of learning process
192.131	the genome has been through
192.131	for the millions of years.
197.318	By reading a genome,
197.318	it can give you a lot of information --
200.265	tells you the bugs in the genome --
201.962	I mean, birth defects,
201.962	monogenetic disorders.
205.166	Reading a drop of blood
206.496	could tell you why you got a fever,
208.628	or it tells you which medicine
208.628	and dosage needs to be used
211.756	when you're sick, especially for cancer.
215.495	A lot of things could be studied,
215.495	but look at that:
222.928	Only .67 percent of the Chinese
222.928	adult population had diabetes.
227.007	Look at now: 11 percent.
229.697	Genetics cannot change over 30 years --
232.849	only one generation.
234.725	It must be something different.
236.376	Diet?
237.598	The environment?
239.372	Lifestyle?
241.219	Even identical twins
241.219	could develop totally differently.
246.879	It could be one becomes
246.879	very obese, the other is not.
250.854	One develops a cancer
250.854	and the other does not.
253.38	Not mentioning living
253.38	in a very stressed environment.
259.386	I moved to Shenzhen 10 years ago ...
262.005	for some reason, people may know.
265.789	If the gene's under stress,
267.752	it behaves totally differently.
270.683	Life is a journey.
272.637	A gene is just a starting point,
275.169	not the end.
277.106	You have this statistical risk
277.106	of certain diseases when you are born.
282.212	But every day you make different choices,
285.799	and those choices will increase
285.799	or decrease the risk of certain diseases.
291.248	But do you know
291.248	where you are on the curve?
294.263	What's the past curve look like?
296.779	What kind of decisions
296.779	are you facing every day?
299.581	And what kind of decision is the right one
302.072	to make your own right curve
302.072	over your life journey?
307.265	What's that?
309.14	The only thing you cannot change,
311.133	you cannot reverse back,
313.338	is time.
314.59	Probably not yet; maybe in the future.
316.615	(Laughter)
317.749	Well, you cannot change
317.749	the decision you've made,
320.592	but can we do something there?
322.463	Can we actually try to run
322.463	multiple options on me,
327.589	and try to predict right
327.589	on the consequence,
331.172	and be able to make the right choice?
333.973	After all,
335.169	we are our choices.
338.233	These lady beetles came to me afterwards.
	the digital lady beetles
344.949	to try to simulate real lady beetles.
347.323	Can I make a digital me ...
349.717	to simulate me?
351.775	I understand the neural
351.775	network could become
354.36	much more sophisticated
354.36	and complicated there.
357.47	Can I make that one,
359.048	and try to run multiple options
359.048	on that digital me --
362.954	to compute that?
364.845	Then I could live in different universes,
367.832	in parallel, at the same time.
370.968	Then I would choose
370.968	whatever is good for me.
374.063	I probably have the most comprehensive
374.063	digital me on the planet.
377.929	I've spent a lot of dollars
377.929	on me, on myself.
381.807	And the digital me told me
381.807	I have a genetic risk of gout
387.037	by all of those things there.
389.074	You need different technology to do that.
391.209	You need the proteins, genes,
392.803	you need metabolized antibodies,
395.353	you need to screen all your body
397.869	about the bacterias and viruses
397.869	covering you, or in you.
401.517	You need to have
401.517	all the smart devices there --
404.329	smart cars, smart house, smart tables,
407.769	smart watch, smart phone
407.769	to track all of your activities there.
411.122	The environment is important --
412.623	everything's important --
413.868	and don't forget the smart toilet.
415.638	(Laughter)
416.693	It's such a waste, right?
418.491	Every day, so much invaluable information
418.491	just has been flushed into the water.
424.616	And you need them.
425.876	You need to measure all of them.
427.424	You need to be able to measure
427.424	everything around you
430.071	and compute them.
431.933	And the digital me told me
431.933	I have a genetic defect.
436.617	I have a very high risk of gout.
439.688	I don't feel anything now,
441.309	I'm still healthy.
442.705	But look at my uric acid level.
444.23	It's double the normal range.
446.739	And the digital me searched
446.739	all the medicine books,
449.584	"and it tells me, ""OK, you could"
449.584	"drink burdock tea"" --"
453.776	I cannot even pronounce it right --
455.498	(Laughter)
456.557	That is from old Chinese wisdom.
458.896	And I drank that tea for three months.
461.679	My uric acid has now gone back to normal.
464.938	I mean, it worked for me.
466.637	All those thousands of years
466.637	of wisdom worked for me.
469.177	I was lucky.
470.684	But I'm probably not lucky for you.
475.009	All of this existing
475.009	knowledge in the world
477.198	cannot possibly be efficient enough
477.198	or personalized enough for yourself.
483.692	The only way to make
483.692	that digital me work ...
487.244	is to learn from yourself.
490.913	You have to ask a lot
490.913	of questions about yourself:
493.341	"""What if?"" --"
495.038	I'm being jet-lagged now here.
496.865	You don't probably see it, but I do.
499.893	What if I eat less?
501.709	When I took metformin,
501.709	supposedly to live longer?
505.394	What if I climb Mt. Everest?
506.765	It's not that easy.
508.091	Or run a marathon?
509.952	What if I drink a bottle of mao-tai,
512.29	which is a Chinese liquor,
513.65	and I get really drunk?
514.868	I was doing a video rehearsal last time
514.868	with the folks here,
519.321	when I was drunk,
520.614	and I totally delivered
520.614	a different speech.
522.727	(Laughter)
525.62	What if I work less, right?
527.945	I have been less stressed, right?
529.851	So that probably never happened to me,
531.685	I was really stressed every day,
533.807	but I hope I could be less stressed.
536.111	These early studies told us,
538.314	even with the same banana,
540.321	we have totally different
540.321	glucose-level reactions
543.332	over different individuals.
544.742	How about me?
546.236	What is the right breakfast for me?
548.258	I need to do two weeks
548.258	of controlled experiments,
551.2	of testing all kinds of different
551.2	food ingredients on me,
554.969	and check my body's reaction.
557.281	And I don't know
557.281	the precise nutrition for me,
560.422	for myself.
563.013	Then I wanted to search
563.013	all the Chinese old wisdom
567.401	about how I can live longer,
567.401	and healthier.
570.709	I did it.
571.961	Some of them are really unachievable.
574.562	I did this once last October,
577.451	by not eating for seven days.
579.969	I did a fast for seven days
579.969	with six partners of mine.
584.598	Look at those people.
585.881	One smile.
587.056	You know why he smiled?
588.231	He cheated.
589.422	(Laughter)
590.446	He drank one cup of coffee at night,
593.606	and we caught it from the data.
595.115	(Laughter)
596.184	We measured everything from the data.
598.668	We were able to track them,
600.906	and we could really see --
602.488	for example, my immune system,
604.513	just to give you a little hint there.
606.299	My immune system changed
606.299	dramatically over 24 hours there.
611.738	And my antibody regulates my proteins
614.895	for that dramatic change.
616.455	And everybody was doing that.
617.86	Even if we're essentially
617.86	totally different at the very beginning.
621.216	And that probably will be
621.216	an interesting treatment in the future
624.285	for cancer and things like that.
625.952	It becomes very, very interesting.
628.106	But something you probably
628.106	don't want to try,
630.831	like drinking fecal water
630.831	from a healthier individual,
634.531	which will make you feel healthier.
636.222	This is from old Chinese wisdom.
637.961	Look at that, right?
639.421	Like 1,700 years ago,
641.611	it's already there, in the book.
644.428	But I still hate the smell.
646.057	(Laughter)
647.231	I want to find out the true way to do it,
649.661	maybe find a combination of cocktails
649.661	of bacterias and drink it,
654.039	it probably will make me better.
655.587	So I'm trying to do that.
656.802	Even though I'm trying this hard,
659.828	it's so difficult to test out
659.828	all possible conditions.
664.878	It's not possible to do
664.878	all kinds of experiments at all ...
671.161	but we do have seven billion
671.161	learning programs on this planet.
674.998	Seven billion.
676.288	And every program
676.288	is running in different conditions
679.963	and doing different experiments.
681.768	Can we all measure them?
684.782	Seven years ago,
684.782	"I wrote an essay in ""Science"""
688.021	to celebrate the human genome's
691.995	"I said, ""Sequence yourself,"
693.673	"for one and for all."""
695.618	But now I'm going to say,
697.51	"""Digitalize yourself for one and for all."""
702.095	When we make this digital me
702.095	into a digital we,
707.719	when we try to form an internet of life,
711.495	when people can learn from each other,
714.38	when people can learn
714.38	from their experience,
717.111	their data,
718.866	when people can really form
718.866	a digital me by themselves
722.491	and we learn from it,
725.236	the digital we will be
725.236	totally different with a digital me.
730.992	But it can only come from the digital me.
735.923	And this is what I try to propose here.
739.941	Join me --
741.764	become we,
743.612	and everybody should build up
743.612	their own digital me,
748.574	because only by that
748.574	will you learn more about you,
753.117	about me,
754.565	about us ...
756.498	about the question I just posed
756.498	at the very beginning:
760.202	"""What is life?"""
761.886	Thank you.
763.079	(Applause)
769.053	Chris Anderson:
769.053	One quick question for you.
772.638	I mean, the work is amazing.
774.636	I suspect one question people have is,
777.858	as we look forward to these amazing
777.858	technical possibilities
781.163	of personalized medicine,
782.548	in the near-term it feels like
782.548	they're only going to be affordable
785.875	for a few people, right?
787.175	It costs many dollars to do
787.175	all the sequencing and so forth.
790.709	Is this going to lead to a kind of,
793.645	you know, increasing inequality?
795.986	Or do you have this vision
795.986	that the knowledge that you get
799.921	from the pioneers
801.297	can actually be
801.297	pretty quickly disseminated
803.417	to help a broader set of recipients?
807.565	Jun Wang: Well, good question.
809.123	I'll tell you that seven years ago,
809.123	when I co-founded BGI,
812.698	and served as the CEO
812.698	of the company there,
816.127	the only goal there for me to do
818.532	was to drive the sequencing cost down.
820.864	It started from 100 million dollars
820.864	per human genome.
823.663	Now, it's a couple hundred dollars
823.663	for a human genome.
826.278	The only reason to do it
826.278	is to get more people to benefit from it.
830.198	So for the digital me,
830.198	it's the same thing.
832.379	Now, you probably need,
833.892	you know, one million dollars
833.892	to digitize a person.
837.621	I think it has to be 100 dollars.
839.807	It has to be free for many of those people
839.807	that urgently need that.
844.192	So this is our goal.
845.813	And it seems that with all
845.813	this merging of the technology,
849.26	I'm thinking that in the very near future,
851.876	let's say three to five years,
854.265	it will come to reality.
855.771	And this is the whole idea
855.771	of why I founded iCarbonX,
859.774	my second company.
861.017	It's really trying to get the cost down
863.909	to a level where every individual
863.909	could have the benefit.
867.353	CA: All right, so the dream is not
867.353	elite health services for few,
870.425	it's to really try
871.683	and actually make overall health care
871.683	much more cost effective --
874.818	JW: But we started
874.818	from some early adopters,
877.272	people believing ideas and so on,
879.802	but eventually, it will become
879.802	everybody's benefit.
884.123	CA: Well, Jun, I think
884.123	it's got to be true to say
886.48	you're one of the most amazing
886.48	scientific minds on the planet,
889.462	and it's an honor to have you.
890.915	JW: Thank you.
892.097	(Applause)
