16.31	It's time to start designing for our ears.
20.101	Architects and designers tend to focus
22.181	exclusively on these.
23.707	They use these to design with and they design for them,
26.821	which is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look
29.149	like this — (loud crowd noise) — and sound like this,
30.946	shouting from a foot away to try and be heard
33.493	by our dinner companion,
34.795	or why we get on airplanes -- (flight attendant announcements) -- which cost 200 million pounds,
38.018	with somebody talking through an old-fashioned telephone handset
41.861	on a cheap stereo system,
43.397	making us jump out of our skins.
46.05	We're designing environments that make us crazy. (Laughter)
49.434	And it's not just our quality of life which suffers.
52.146	It's our health,
53.921	our social behavior, and our productivity as well.
57.932	How does this work? Well, two ways.
59.574	First of all, ambience. I have a whole TEDTalk about this.
63.013	Sound affects us physiologically, psychologically,
66.444	cognitively and behaviorally all the time.
68.644	The sound around us is affecting us
70.381	even though we're not conscious of it.
72.703	There's a second way though, as well.
74.459	That's interference. Communication requires sending
77.836	and receiving, and I have another whole TEDTalk
81.736	about the importance of conscious listening,
84.2	but I can send as well as I like,
86.234	and you can be brilliant conscious listeners.
88.648	If the space I'm sending it in is not effective,
92.148	that communication can't happen.
94.642	Spaces tend to include noise and acoustics.
97.172	A room like this has acoustics, this one very good acoustics.
100.872	Many rooms are not so good.
103.04	Let me give you some examples from a couple of areas
105.071	which I think we all care about: health and education.
108.544	(Hospital noises) When I was visiting my terminally ill father
110.776	in a hospital, I was asking myself,
112.808	how does anybody get well in a place that sounds like this?
116.945	Hospital sound is getting worse all the time.
119.253	Noise levels in hospitals have doubled
121.259	in the last few years, and it affects not just the patients
124.863	but also the people working there.
126.679	I think we would like for dispensing errors to be zero,
130.556	wouldn't we? And yet, as noise levels go up, so do
134.021	the errors in dispensing made by the staff in hospitals.
137.575	Most of all, though, it affects the patients,
140.63	and that could be you, it could be me.
142.838	Sleep is absolutely crucial for recovery.
145.177	It's when we regenerate, when we rebuild ourselves,
148.217	and with threatening noise like this going on,
150.601	your body, even if you are able to sleep, your body
153.753	"is telling you, ""I'm under threat. This is dangerous."""
156.796	And the quality of sleep is degraded, and so is our recovery.
160.025	There are just huge benefits to come
162.177	from designing for the ears in our health care.
165.214	This is an area I intend to take on this year.
168.121	Education.
170.086	When I see a classroom that looks like this,
171.682	can you imagine how this sounds?
173.559	I am forced to ask myself a question.
175.89	"(""Do architects have ears?"") (Laughter)"
178.467	Now, that's a little unfair. Some of my best friends
181.134	are architects. (Laughter) And they definitely do have ears.
184.023	But I think sometimes they don't use them
186.088	when they're designing buildings. Here's a case in point.
188.751	This is a 32-million-pound flagship academy school
192.442	which was built quite recently in the U.K. and designed
194.447	by one of Britain's top architects.
197.594	Unfortunately, it was designed like a corporate
199.419	headquarters, with a vast central atrium
201.818	and classrooms leading off it with no back walls at all.
206.092	The children couldn't hear their teachers.
208.018	They had to go back in and spend 600,000 pounds
210.739	putting the walls in. Let's stop this madness
213.819	of open plan classrooms right now, please.
217.881	It's not just these modern buildings which suffer.
221.409	Old-fashioned classrooms suffer too.
223.746	A study in Florida just a few years ago found
225.94	that if you're sitting where this photograph was taken
227.617	in the classroom, row four, speech intelligibility
230.817	is just 50 percent.
233.268	Children are losing one word in two.
235.468	Now that doesn't mean they only get half their education,
238.113	but it does mean they have to work very hard
239.825	to join the dots and understand what's going on.
242.801	This is affected massively by reverberation time,
245.574	how reverberant a room is.
247.474	In a classroom with a reverberation time of 1.2 seconds,
251.032	which is pretty common, this is what it sounds like.
254.728	(Inaudible echoing voice)
267.032	Not so good, is it?
268.849	If you take that 1.2 seconds down to 0.4 seconds
273.308	by installing acoustic treatments, sound absorbing materials
276.256	and so forth, this is what you get.
278.964	Voice: In language, infinitely many words can be written
282.825	with a small set of letters. In arithmetic,
285.697	infinitely many numbers can be composed
288.051	from just a few digits with the help of the simple zero.
291.653	Julian Treasure: What a difference.
293.217	Now that education you would receive,
295.057	and thanks to the British acoustician Adrian James
297.987	for those simulations. The signal was the same,
300.676	the background noise was the same.
302.075	All that changed was the acoustics of the classroom
304.518	in those two examples.
306.192	If education can be likened to watering a garden,
308.612	which is a fair metaphor, sadly, much of the water
312.779	is evaporating before it reaches the flowers,
315.835	especially for some groups,
317.867	for example, those with hearing impairment.
321.243	Now that's not just deaf children. That could be any child
323.995	who's got a cold, glue ear, an ear infection,
326.43	even hay fever. On a given day, one in eight children
328.806	fall into that group, on any given day.
331.622	Then you have children for whom English is a second language,
334.798	or whatever they're being taught in is a second language.
337.734	In the U.K., that's more than 10 percent of the school population.
341.318	And finally, after Susan Cain's wonderful TEDTalk in February,
344.978	we know that introverts find it very difficult to relate
348.194	when they're in a noisy environment doing group work.
350.891	Add those up. That is a lot of children
353.552	who are not receiving their education properly.
355.964	It's not just the children who are affected, though.
358.2	(Noisy conversation) This study in Germany found
359.783	the average noise level in classrooms is 65 decibels.
363.338	I have to really raise my voice to talk over 65 decibels
367.564	of sound, and teachers are not just raising their voices.
371.348	This chart maps the teacher's heart rate
374.156	against the noise level.
376.58	Noise goes up, heart rate goes up.
379.287	That is not good for you.
381.436	In fact, 65 decibels is the very level at which this big survey
385.516	of all the evidence on noise and health found that, that is
389.044	the threshold for the danger of myocardial infarction.
393.751	To you and me, that's a heart attack.
396.6	It may not be pushing the boat out too far to suggest
399.319	that many teachers are losing significant life expectancy
403.619	by teaching in environments like that day after day.
407.891	What does it cost to treat a classroom
409.947	down to that 0.4-second reverberation time?
412.717	Two and a half thousand pounds.
415.451	And the Essex study which has just been done in the U.K.,
418.627	which incidentally showed that when you do this,
420.968	you do not just make a room that's suitable
423.331	for hearing-impaired children, you make a room
424.928	where behavior improves, and results improve significantly,
430.212	this found that sending a child out of area to a school
434.204	that does have such a room, if you don't have one,
436.835	costs 90,000 pounds a year.
440.297	I think the economics are pretty clear on this.
442.684	I'm glad that debate is happening on this.
444.703	I just moderated a major conference in London
447.269	a few weeks ago called Sound Education,
449.318	which brought together top acousticians,
451.115	government people, teachers, and so forth.
453.136	We're at last starting to debate this issue, and the benefits
457.335	that are available for designing for the ears in education,
460.035	unbelievable.
461.846	Out of that conference, incidentally, also came
464.915	a free app which is designed to help children study
467.917	if they're having to work at home, for example,
470.288	in a noisy kitchen.
471.88	And that's free out of that conference.
475.118	Let's broaden the perspective a little bit
478.069	and look at cities.
479.48	We have urban planners.
481.972	Where are the urban sound planners?
485.117	I don't know of one in the world, and the opportunity is there
488.324	to transform our experience in our cities.
490.86	The World Health Organization estimates
492.967	that a quarter of Europe's population is having its sleep
495.551	degraded by noise in cities. We can do better than that.
499.484	And in our offices, we spend a lot of time at work.
502.313	Where are the office sound planners?
504.972	People who say, don't sit that team next to this team,
506.859	because they like noise and they need quiet.
509.192	Or who say, don't spend all your budget on a huge screen
511.931	in the conference room,
512.874	and then place one tiny microphone
514.883	in the middle of a table for 30 people. (Laughter)
518.12	If you can hear me, you can understand me
520.239	without seeing me. If you can see me without hearing me,
523.364	that does not work.
525.468	So office sound is a huge area, and incidentally,
528.684	noise in offices has been shown to make people
530.82	less helpful, less enjoy their teamwork,
533.443	and less productive at work.
535.964	Finally, we have homes. We use interior designers.
539.017	Where are the interior sound designers?
541.252	Hey, let's all be interior sound designers,
544.592	take on listening to our rooms and designing sound
547.409	that's effective and appropriate.
548.927	My friend Richard Mazuch, an architect in London,
551.468	"coined the phrase ""invisible architecture."""
554.354	I love that phrase.
555.904	It's about designing, not appearance, but experience,
560.984	so that we have spaces that sound as good as they look,
564.592	that are fit for purpose, that improve our quality of life,
568.102	our health and well being, our social behavior
571.343	and our productivity.
573.219	It's time to start designing for the ears.
576.725	Thank you. (Applause)
579.555	(Applause)
581.087	Thank you. (Applause)
