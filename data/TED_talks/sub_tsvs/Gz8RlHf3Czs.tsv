12.717	Nicole Paris: TEDYouth, make some noise!
14.738	(Beatboxing)
16.643	TEDYouth, make some --
18.168	(Beatboxing)
40.216	(Beatboxing ends)
43.199	Are you ready?
44.377	(Cheers and applause)
45.655	Are you ready?
47.956	Ed Cage: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
49.38	(Beatboxing)
55.357	(Laughter)
57.596	EC: Y'all like that? Let me show you
57.596	how we used to do it --
60.438	NP: Get it pops, go ahead.
61.715	EC: ... when I was growing up in the '90s.
64.107	(Beatboxing)
69.815	(Beatboxing ends)
72.555	(Laughter)
74.432	(Beatboxing)
87.912	NP: Pops, pops, pops, pops, pops, pops,
89.849	hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up!
91.866	Oh my God.
94.151	OK, he's trying to battle me.
95.716	Hold on, right now, hold on.
97.882	Do you remember when you used
97.882	to beatbox me to sleep?
101.895	EC: Yeah, yeah, I remember.
103.348	That's when she was a little baby.
105.925	We would do something like this.
107.491	(Beatboxing)
116.273	NP: I remember that.
117.744	(Beatboxing)
128.008	NP: All right, pops, pops, pops,
128.008	chill out, chill out.
130.785	Hold up, hold up, hold up.
132.297	EC: Y'all remember the video.
133.71	This is like a little payback or something
135.914	for 50 million people
135.914	calling me the loser.
138.437	NP: Hold up, hold up.
139.819	But a lot of people out there don't
139.819	really know what beatboxing is,
143.002	where it started from.
144.549	EC: Right, right.
145.724	NP: Where it came from.
146.941	So why don't you give
146.941	them a little history --
149.322	just a tickle -- a bit of history
149.322	of where it comes from.
152.037	EC: Beatbox started here in New York.
153.918	(Cheers)
155.093	That's right, that's right.
155.093	New York, New York!
158.604	"Everybody like, ""Yeah!"""
160.255	Well, we from St. Louis.
161.769	(Laughter)
162.811	NP: Now you can put y'all hands down.
164.955	(Laughter)
166.278	EC: But beatbox started here in New York.
168.279	What you would have is that,
168.279	when we would go to parties,
170.994	you would have the DJ
170.994	and you would have the rapper.
173.494	But because I don't have
173.494	electricity coming out of me,
176.261	we had to emulate
176.261	what the beats was doing.
179.41	So when you would see the beatboxer,
182.027	you would see us over to the side.
183.987	Then you would see a rapper,
183.987	and when the rapper began to rap,
186.937	we would do a simple beat,
188.215	because back then the beats were simple --
190.261	(Beatboxing)
195.146	or --
196.321	(Beatboxing)
202.041	Those were simple beats.
203.892	But now, you got folks that want
203.892	to do all type of stuff
208.318	with their beats now,
209.559	and they want to humiliate their father,
211.972	which is not right when you want
211.972	to humiliate the person
215.246	that take care of you, pay
215.246	all your tuition, (Nicole laughs)
218.136	especially when you have 50 million people
220.547	that just go around
220.547	"and call you ""the loser."""
222.688	Well, I'm taking that to heart.
224.617	But now we do something
224.617	different in our house,
226.849	so we have these jam sessions,
228.774	and our jam sessions consist
228.774	of us jamming in church.
233.032	You know, in church,
233.032	we'll look at each other like,
235.489	(Beatboxing)
236.664	(Laughter)
237.689	and we'll text the beat to each other.
240.018	Or we'll be in the kitchen cooking,
242.411	road trips, airports.
244.69	NP: Standing right there in the corner,
244.69	"""Aw, Dad -- listen to that."""
247.988	(Beatboxing)
249.2	Naw, I'm kidding. But you know what?
251.852	We're talking all about this
251.852	jam session and everything.
255.079	EC: Yeah.
256.253	NP: Why don't we give them a little peek,
256.253	just a tiny bit of our jam session?
260.774	NP: Y'all want to hear some jam session?
260.774	EC: Y'all ready for a jam session?
264.34	(Cheers)
265.365	NP: Sorry? I can't hear you.
266.734	(Cheers)
267.759	Yeah! Kick it, pops!
268.934	(Beatboxing)
330.382	(Applause)
333.864	(Beatboxing)
362.265	(Beatboxing ends)
364.958	(Applause)
369.263	NP: I'm getting ready to go!
370.645	EC: Y'all ready? Everybody stand up!
370.645	Come on, everybody stand up!
373.776	Get on up! Come on, stretch!
376.494	(Beatboxing)
406.61	(Beatboxing ends)
408.74	NP: That's it.
409.917	(Cheers and applause)
413.063	Thank you! Make some noise!
414.39	EG: Thank you, everybody!
415.612	NP: Make some noise! Make some noise!
417.516	Thank you!
