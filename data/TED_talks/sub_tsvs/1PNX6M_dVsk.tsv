12.12	So I'm going to talk about trust,
14.215	and I'm going to start by reminding you
16.495	of the standard views that people have about trust.
20.576	I think these are so commonplace,
22.815	they've become clich√©s of our society.
25.103	And I think there are three.
27.129	One's a claim: there has been a great decline in trust,
31.961	very widely believed.
33.869	The second is an aim: we should have more trust.
38.376	And the third is a task: we should rebuild trust.
43.866	I think that the claim, the aim and the task
48.204	are all misconceived.
50.374	So what I'm going to try to tell you today
52.023	is a different story about a claim, an aim and a task
56.713	which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter.
61.34	First the claim: Why do people think trust has declined?
66.106	And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence,
69.907	I don't know the answer.
71.681	I'm inclined to think it may have declined
75.49	in some activities or some institutions
78.996	and it might have grown in others.
80.8	I don't have an overview.
82.744	But, of course, I can look at the opinion polls,
87.081	and the opinion polls are supposedly
89.449	the source of a belief that trust has declined.
93.401	When you actually look at opinion polls across time,
97.258	there's not much evidence for that.
99.056	That's to say, the people who were mistrusted
103.257	principally journalists and politicians, are still mistrusted.
107.81	And the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago
111.18	are still rather highly trusted: judges, nurses.
114.625	The rest of us are in between,
116.529	and by the way, the average person in the street
119.599	is almost exactly midway.
121.623	But is that good evidence?
123.856	What opinion polls record is, of course, opinions.
128.012	What else can they record?
129.579	So they're looking at the generic attitudes
133.12	that people report when you ask them certain questions.
136.659	Do you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers?
140.589	"Now if somebody said to you, ""Do you trust greengrocers?"
144.221	Do you trust fishmongers?
146.118	"Do you trust elementary school teachers?"""
148.75	"you would probably begin by saying, ""To do what?"""
152.341	And that would be a perfectly sensible response.
155.555	And you might say, when you understood the answer to that,
160.68	"""Well, I trust some of them, but not others."""
164.12	That's a perfectly rational thing.
166.038	In short, in our real lives,
169.16	we seek to place trust in a differentiated way.
172.81	We don't make an assumption that the level of trust
176.386	that we will have in every instance of a certain type
179.882	of official or office-holder or type of person
183.797	is going to be uniform.
185.742	I might, for example, say that I certainly trust
189.465	a certain elementary school teacher I know
191.91	to teach the reception class to read,
194.536	but in no way to drive the school minibus.
198.184	I might, after all, know that she wasn't a good driver.
201.285	I might trust my most loquacious friend
204.562	to keep a conversation going
206.654	but not -- but perhaps not to keep a secret.
216.313	Simple.
217.562	So if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives
222.468	of the way that trust is differentiated,
224.584	why do we sort of drop all that intelligence
227.835	when we think about trust more abstractly?
231.458	I think the polls are very bad guides
234.202	to the level of trust that actually exists,
237.259	because they try to obliterate the good judgment
240.831	that goes into placing trust.
244.238	Secondly, what about the aim?
246.43	The aim is to have more trust.
249.05	Well frankly, I think that's a stupid aim.
252.379	It's not what I would aim at.
254.326	I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy
257.789	but not in the untrustworthy.
260.806	In fact, I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy.
267.348	And I think, of those people who, for example,
270.96	placed their savings with the very aptly named Mr. Madoff,
275.661	who then made off with them,
278.3	and I think of them, and I think, well, yes,
280.63	too much trust.
282.493	More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life.
286.35	Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust
290.344	is the proper aim.
292.811	Well once one says that, one says, yeah, okay,
296.274	that means that what matters in the first place
299.418	is not trust but trustworthiness.
302.559	It's judging how trustworthy people are
305.477	in particular respects.
307.406	And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things.
310.754	Are they competent? Are they honest? Are they reliable?
315.966	And if we find that a person is competent
318.038	in the relevant matters,
319.774	and reliable and honest,
321.695	we'll have a pretty good reason to trust them,
323.989	because they'll be trustworthy.
326.2	But if, on the other hand, they're unreliable, we might not.
329.866	I have friends who are competent and honest,
332.11	but I would not trust them to post a letter,
333.897	because they're forgetful.
336.469	I have friends who are very confident
339.141	they can do certain things,
341.104	but I realize that they overestimate their own competence.
345.512	And I'm very glad to say, I don't think I have many friends
348.167	who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest.
351.801	(Laughter)
352.641	If so, I haven't yet spotted it.
356.028	But that's what we're looking for:
358.322	trustworthiness before trust.
360.52	Trust is the response.
362.428	Trustworthiness is what we have to judge.
364.768	And, of course, it's difficult.
366.499	Across the last few decades, we've tried to construct
369.848	systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions
373.121	and professionals and officials and so on
375.217	that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.
379.823	A lot of these systems have the converse effect.
383.095	They don't work as they're supposed to.
384.971	I remember I was talking with a midwife who said,
389.386	"""Well, you see, the problem is it takes longer"
391.718	"to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby."""
395.219	And all over our public life, our institutional life,
398.99	we find that problem,
400.84	that the system of accountability
403.253	that is meant to secure trustworthiness
405.582	and evidence of trustworthiness
408.332	is actually doing the opposite.
410.196	It is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks,
414.833	like midwives, from doing them
417.146	by requiring them to tick the boxes, as we say.
420.104	You can all give your own examples there.
422.838	So so much for the aim.
424.748	The aim, I think, is more trustworthiness,
427.638	and that is going to be different
429.797	if we are trying to be trustworthy
431.746	and communicate our trustworthiness to other people,
434.772	and if we are trying to judge whether other people
437.676	or office-holders or politicians are trustworthy.
440.848	It's not easy. It is judgment, and simple reaction,
445.222	attitudes, don't do adequately here.
450.084	Now thirdly, the task.
453.649	Calling the task rebuilding trust, I think,
457.221	also gets things backwards.
458.96	It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
463.815	Well, we can do that for ourselves.
466.268	We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.
468.666	We can do it two people together trying to improve trust.
472.298	But trust, in the end, is distinctive
475.502	because it's given by other people.
478.262	You can't rebuild what other people give you.
481.439	You have to give them the basis
484.166	for giving you their trust.
487.349	So you have to, I think, be trustworthy.
490.541	And that, of course, is because you can't fool
492.925	all of the people all of the time, usually.
496.511	But you also have to provide usable evidence
501.157	that you are trustworthy.
502.711	How to do it?
504.253	Well every day, all over the place, it's being done
507.463	by ordinary people, by officials, by institutions,
510.477	quite effectively.
512.317	Let me give you a simple commercial example.
515.83	The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back,
519.72	and they don't ask any questions.
521.972	They take them back and give me the money
523.733	or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted.
526.365	That's super. I trust them
528.554	because they have made themselves vulnerable to me.
531.885	I think there's a big lesson in that.
533.878	If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party,
536.932	then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy
540.835	and you have confidence in what you are saying.
543.853	So in the end, I think what we are aiming for
546.025	is not very difficult to discern.
549.565	It is relationships in which people are trustworthy
553.77	and can judge when and how the other person
557.645	is trustworthy.
558.933	So the moral of all this is,
562.791	we need to think much less about trust,
565.945	let alone about attitudes of trust
569.48	detected or mis-detected by opinion polls,
573.166	much more about being trustworthy,
575.78	and how you give people adequate, useful
579.685	and simple evidence that you're trustworthy.
582.429	Thanks.
583.49	(Applause)
