12.606	I recently retired
13.744	from the California Highway Patrol
15.788	after 23 years of service.
18.725	The majority of those 23 years
20.691	was spent patrolling the southern end
23.319	of Marin County,
24.852	which includes the Golden Gate Bridge.
28.029	The bridge is an iconic structure,
30.316	known worldwide
31.569	for its beautiful views of San Francisco,
34.245	the Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring architecture.
38.636	Unfortunately, it is also a magnet for suicide,
43.052	being one of the most utilized sites in the world.
47.631	The Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937.
50.761	Joseph Strauss, chief engineer
50.761	in charge of building the bridge,
55.084	was quoted as saying,
56.688	"""The bridge is practically suicide-proof."
60.084	Suicide from the bridge
61.793	"is neither practical nor probable."""
65.559	But since its opening,
67.853	over 1,600 people have leapt to their death
71	from that bridge.
73.162	Some believe that traveling
75.366	between the two towers
77.431	will lead you to another dimension --
79.554	this bridge has been romanticized as such â€”
83.01	that the fall from that
84.589	frees you from all your worries and grief,
87.623	and the waters below
89.407	will cleanse your soul.
91.531	But let me tell you what actually occurs
93.855	when the bridge is used
95.041	as a means of suicide.
97.095	After a free fall of four to five seconds,
100.549	the body strikes the water
103.218	at about 75 miles an hour.
106.9	That impact shatters bones,
109.617	some of which then puncture vital organs.
112.969	Most die on impact.
115.318	Those that don't
117.07	generally flail in the water helplessly,
119.663	and then drown.
121.882	I don't think that those who contemplate
124.05	this method of suicide
125.872	realize how grisly a death that they will face.
131.048	This is the cord.
133.176	Except for around the two towers,
135.233	there is 32 inches of steel
137.521	paralleling the bridge.
139.051	This is where most folks stand
141.336	before taking their lives.
143.87	I can tell you from experience
145.904	that once the person is on that cord,
148.638	and at their darkest time,
150.396	it is very difficult to bring them back.
153.69	I took this photo last year
155.732	as this young woman spoke to an officer
157.668	contemplating her life.
159.666	I want to tell you very happily
161.922	that we were successful that day
164.03	in getting her back over the rail.
166.954	When I first began working on the bridge,
169.346	we had no formal training.
171.83	You struggled to funnel your
171.83	way through these calls.
175.624	This was not only a disservice
178.088	to those contemplating suicide,
180.127	but to the officers as well.
182.92	We've come a long, long way since then.
186.1	Now, veteran officers and psychologists
189.669	train new officers.
192.34	This is Jason Garber.
194.549	I met Jason on July 22 of last year
197.76	when I get received a call
198.875	of a possible suicidal subject
200.817	sitting on the cord near midspan.
203.566	I responded, and when I arrived,
206.263	I observed Jason
208.077	speaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer.
211.448	Jason was just 32 years old
213.972	and had flown out here from New Jersey.
216.804	As a matter of fact,
218.348	he had flown out here on two other occasions
220.166	from New Jersey
221.928	to attempt suicide on this bridge.
225.342	After about an hour of speaking with Jason,
228.9	he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's box.
232.635	Recalling your Greek mythology,
235.07	Zeus created Pandora,
237.04	and sent her down to Earth with a box,
240.394	"and told her, ""Never, ever open that box."""
244.298	Well one day, curiosity got the better of Pandora,
246.94	and she did open the box.
249.342	Out flew plagues, sorrows,
252.194	and all sorts of evils against man.
255.406	The only good thing in the box was hope.
259.985	Jason then asked us,
262.558	"""What happens when you open the box"
265.542	"and hope isn't there?"""
268.724	He paused a few moments,
271.774	leaned to his right,
274.213	and was gone.
276.414	This kind, intelligent young man from New Jersey
280.284	had just committed suicide.
284.064	I spoke with Jason's parents that evening,
287.064	and I suppose that, when I was speaking with them,
289.626	that I didn't sound as if I was doing very well,
293.39	because that very next day,
295.61	their family rabbi called to check on me.
299.13	Jason's parents had asked him to do so.
302.924	The collateral damage of suicide
305.132	affects so many people.
310.235	I pose these questions to you:
313.216	What would you do if your family member,
315.884	friend or loved one was suicidal?
318.992	What would you say?
321.426	Would you know what to say?
324.656	In my experience, it's not just the talking that you do,
328.582	but the listening.
330.83	Listen to understand.
335.446	Don't argue, blame,
337.974	or tell the person you know how they feel,
341.742	because you probably don't.
344.353	By just being there,
347.264	you may just be the turning point that they need.
351.587	If you think someone is suicidal,
354.691	don't be afraid to confront
354.691	them and ask the question.
358.405	One way of asking them the question is like this:
362.615	"""Others in similar circumstances"
365.029	have thought about ending their life;
367.197	"have you had these thoughts?"""
369.956	Confronting the person head-on
372.752	may just save their life and
372.752	be the turning point for them.
376.702	Some other signs to look for:
379.151	hopelessness, believing that things are terrible
383.299	and never going to get better;
386.426	helplessness, believing that there is nothing
389.871	that you can do about it;
392.303	recent social withdrawal;
394.9	and a loss of interest in life.
399.717	I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago,
403.639	and I received an email from a lady
406.84	that I'd like to read you her letter.
411.325	She lost her son on January 19 of this year,
419.437	and she wrote this me this email
421.25	just a couple of days ago,
424.62	and it's with her permission and blessing
426.62	that I read this to you.
429.645	"""Hi, Kevin. I imagine you're at the TED Conference."
433.647	That must be quite the experience to be there.
436.581	I'm thinking I should go walk
436.581	the bridge this weekend.
440.213	Just wanted to drop you a note.
442.746	Hope you get the word out to many people
444.967	and they go home talking about it
447.079	to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
451.745	I'm still pretty numb,
454.189	but noticing more moments of really realizing
457.261	Mike isn't coming home.
459.973	Mike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco
462.72	to watch the 49ers game with his father
464.637	on January 19.
466.67	He never made it there.
469.614	I called Petaluma police
471.661	and reported him missing that evening.
474.157	The next morning,
476.059	two officers came to my home
479.782	and reported that Mike's car was down at the bridge.
484.286	A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge
486.75	at 1:58 p.m. the previous day.
491.002	Thanks so much
493.622	for standing up for those
494.806	who may be only temporarily too weak
497.358	to stand for themselves.
499.9	Who hasn't been low before
501.92	without suffering from a true mental illness?
505.696	It shouldn't be so easy to end it.
509.057	My prayers are with you for your fight.
512.454	The GGB, Golden Gate Bridge,
516.05	is supposed to be a passage across
518.776	our beautiful bay,
520.859	not a graveyard.
523.546	"Good luck this week. Vicky."""
528.81	I can't imagine the courage it takes for her
531.853	to go down to that bridge and walk the path
533.795	that her son took that day,
537.233	and also the courage just to carry on.
542.307	I'd like to introduce you to a man
546.053	I refer to as hope and courage.
551.695	On March 11 of 2005,
554.334	I responded to a radio call of a possible
556.997	suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk
559.211	near the north tower.
560.699	I rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk
563.387	and observed this man, Kevin Berthia,
566.099	standing on the sidewalk.
568.635	When he saw me, he immediately traversed
572.06	that pedestrian rail,
574.237	and stood on that small pipe
575.109	which goes around the tower.
578.181	For the next hour and a half,
580.515	I listened as Kevin spoke about
583.443	his depression and hopelessness.
586.331	Kevin decided on his own that day
589.005	to come back over that rail
590.687	and give life another chance.
593.419	When Kevin came back over,
595.19	I congratulated him.
597.231	"""This is a new beginning, a new life."""
599.981	"But I asked him, ""What was it"
603.015	that made you come back
604.74	"and give hope and life another chance?"""
607.53	And you know what he told me?
610.221	"He said, ""You listened."
612.751	"You let me speak, and you just listened."""
617.951	Shortly after this incident,
619.91	I received a letter from Kevin's mother,
623.169	and I have that letter with me,
626.081	and I'd like to read it to you.
628.931	"""Dear Mr. Briggs,"
631.087	Nothing will erase the events of March 11,
633.952	but you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us.
637.08	I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help.
641.373	He has been diagnosed with a mental illness
644.095	for which he has been properly medicated.
646.929	I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old,
650.297	completely unaware of any hereditary traits,
654.245	but, thank God, now we know.
658.429	Kevin is straight, as he says.
661.255	We truly thank God for you.
663.94	Sincerely indebted to you,
666.341	"Narvella Berthia."""
669.033	And on the bottom she writes,
671.081	"""P.S. When I visited San Francisco"
671.081	General Hospital that evening,
676.517	you were listed as the patient.
678.445	"Boy, did I have to straighten that one out."""
683.427	Today, Kevin is a loving father
687.557	and contributing member of society.
690.242	He speaks openly
691.711	about the events that day and his depression
694.645	in the hopes that his story
696.327	will inspire others.
699.401	Suicide is not just something
699.401	I've encountered on the job.
702.831	It's personal.
704.863	My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning.
708.737	That act, although ending his own pain,
712.611	robbed me from ever getting to know him.
717.157	This is what suicide does.
719.823	For most suicidal folks,
722.171	or those contemplating suicide,
724.125	they wouldn't think of hurting another person.
726.831	They just want their own pain to end.
730.415	Typically, this is accomplished in just three ways:
734.451	sleep, drugs or alcohol, or death.
740.109	In my career, I've responded to
742.829	and been involved in hundreds
745.182	of mental illness and suicide calls
747.96	around the bridge.
749.754	Of those incidents I've been directly involved with,
753.265	I've only lost two,
755.237	but that's two too many.
757.423	One was Jason.
759.435	The other was a man I spoke to
761.691	for about an hour.
763.374	During that time, he shook my hand
765.79	on three occasions.
768.527	On that final handshake,
770.603	he looked at me, and he said,
772.937	"""Kevin, I'm sorry, but I have to go."""
778.34	And he leapt.
780.473	Horrible, absolutely horrible.
783.279	I do want to tell you, though,
785.255	the vast majority of folks
787.607	that we do get to contact on that bridge
791.129	do not commit suicide.
794.325	Additionally, that very few
797.315	who have jumped off the bridge and lived
799.971	and can talk about it,
801.317	that one to two percent,
804.13	most of those folks have said
805.961	that the second that they let go of that rail,
809.315	they knew that they had made a mistake
811.88	and they wanted to live.
814.931	I tell people, the bridge not only connects
819.364	Marin to San Francisco,
821.645	but people together also.
824.837	That connection, or bridge that we make,
828.63	is something that each and every one of us
831.059	should strive to do.
833.053	Suicide is preventable.
836.077	There is help. There is hope.
839.411	Thank you very much.
842.441	(Applause)
