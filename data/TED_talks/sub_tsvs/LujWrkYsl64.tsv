12.937	The work of a transportation commissioner
15.096	isn't just about stop signs and traffic signals.
18.59	It involves the design of cities
20.764	and the design of city streets.
23.16	Streets are some of the most valuable resources
26.131	that a city has, and yet it's an asset
28.909	that's largely hidden in plain sight.
31.765	And the lesson from New York
33.346	over the past six years
35.004	is that you can update this asset.
37.3	You can remake your streets quickly, inexpensively,
40.998	it can provide immediate benefits,
43.736	and it can be quite popular.
46.337	You just need to look at them a little differently.
49.829	This is important because we live in an urban age.
53.577	For the first time in history,
55.656	most people live in cities,
58.421	and the U.N. estimates that over the next 40 years,
61.984	the population is going to double on the planet.
64.885	So the design of cities is a key issue for our future.
69.328	Mayor Bloomberg recognized this
70.913	when he launched PlaNYC in 2007.
74.152	The plan recognized that cities
76.865	are in a global marketplace,
78.987	and that if we're going to continue to grow and thrive
81.712	and to attract the million more people
85.015	that are expected to move here,
86.615	we need to focus on the quality of life
89.866	and the efficiency of our infrastructure.
93.534	For many cities, our streets have been
95.177	in a kind of suspended animation for generations.
99.286	This is a picture of Times Square in the '50s,
102.862	and despite all of the technological innovation,
106.841	cultural changes, political changes,
109.29	this is Times Square in 2008.
111.545	Not much has changed in those 50 years.
115.918	So we worked hard to refocus our agenda,
118.981	to maximize efficient mobility,
121.596	providing more room for buses, more room for bikes,
125.177	more room for people to enjoy the city,
128.236	and to make our streets as safe as they can be
130.471	for everybody that uses them.
133.579	We set out a clear action plan
136.067	with goals and benchmarks.
138.763	Having goals is important,
140.981	because if you want to change and steer the ship
145.102	of a big city in a new direction,
147.725	you need to know where you're going and why.
151.921	The design of a street can tell you everything
154.174	about what's expected on it.
156.523	In this case, it's expected that you shelter in place.
160.524	The design of this street is really
162.461	to maximize the movement of cars
165.121	moving as quickly as possible
166.849	from point A to point B,
168.672	and it misses all the other ways
170.564	that a street is used.
172.991	When we started out, we did some early surveys
175.942	about how our streets were used,
177.987	and we found that New York City was largely
179.983	a city without seats.
182.114	Pictures like this, people perched
184.498	on a fire hydrant, not the mark of a world-class city.
188.671	(Laughter)
190.959	It's not great for parents with kids.
193.435	It's not great for seniors. It's not great for retailers.
196.671	It's probably not good for the fire hydrants.
199.712	Certainly not good for the police department.
202.764	So we worked hard to change that balance,
205.773	and probably the best example of our new approach
209.108	is in Times Square.
210.743	Three hundred and fifty thousand people a day
214.573	walk through Times Square,
216.283	and people had tried for years to make changes.
218.773	They changed signals, they changed lanes,
221.161	everything they could do to make Times Square work better.
224.064	It was dangerous, hard to cross the street.
226.986	It was chaotic.
228.707	And so, none of those approaches worked,
231.489	so we took a different approach, a bigger approach,
233.538	looked at our street differently.
235.207	And so we did a six-month pilot.
238.78	We closed Broadway from 42nd Street to 47th Street
243.036	and created two and a half acres
245.57	of new pedestrian space.
248.346	And the temporary materials are an important part
251.513	of the program, because we were able to show
254.938	how it worked.
256.307	And I work for a data-driven mayor, as you probably know.
259.286	So it was all about the data.
261.122	So if it worked better for traffic, if it was better for mobility,
264.295	if it was safer, better for business, we would keep it,
266.648	and if it didn't work, no harm, no foul,
269.379	we could put it back the way that it was,
271.269	because these were temporary materials.
272.53	And that was a very big part of the buy-in,
275.439	much less anxiety when you think that something
277.582	can be put back.
279.453	But the results were overwhelming.
281.607	Traffic moved better. It was much safer.
284.527	Five new flagship stores opened.
286.934	It's been a total home run.
288.807	Times Square is now one of the top 10
291.39	retail locations on the planet.
294.021	And this is an important lesson,
296.455	because it doesn't need to be a zero-sum game
299.553	between moving traffic and creating public space.
304.078	Every project has its surprises,
306.893	and one of the big surprises with Times Square
309.546	was how quickly people flocked to the space.
313.226	We put out the orange barrels,
315.284	and people just materialized immediately into the street.
318.892	It was like a Star Trek episode, you know?
320.933	They weren't there before, and then zzzzzt!
323.262	All the people arrived.
324.64	Where they'd been, I don't know, but they were there.
327.398	And this actually posed an immediate challenge for us,
330.542	because the street furniture had not yet arrived.
334.058	So we went to a hardware store
336.68	and bought hundreds of lawn chairs,
339.027	and we put those lawn chairs out on the street.
342.219	And the lawn chairs became the talk of the town.
346.115	It wasn't about that we'd closed Broadway to cars.
348.999	It was about those lawn chairs.
350.358	"""What did you think about the lawn chairs?"""
351.889	"""Do you like the color of the lawn chairs?"""
353.566	So if you've got a big, controversial project,
357.332	think about lawn chairs.
359.043	(Laughter)
361.953	This is the final design for Times Square,
364.45	and it will create a level surface,
366.99	sidewalk to sidewalk,
368.674	beautiful pavers that have studs in them
370.902	to reflect the light from the billboards,
372.94	creating a great new energy on the street,
375.653	and we think it's going to really create
377.77	a great place, a new crossroads of the world
379.928	that is worthy of its name.
381.451	And we will be cutting the ribbon on this,
382.952	the first phase, this December.
386.554	With all of our projects, our public space projects,
389.011	we work closely with local businesses
391.224	and local merchant groups
392.755	who maintain the spaces, move the furniture,
396.071	take care of the plants.
397.492	This is in front of Macy's, and they were
399.511	a big supporter of this new approach,
401.625	because they understood that more people on foot
406.472	is better for business.
408.453	And we've done these projects all across the city
411.123	in all kinds of neighborhoods.
412.735	This is in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn,
414.861	and you can see the short leg that was there,
416.953	used for cars, that's not really needed.
419.203	So what we did is we painted over the street,
422.792	put down epoxy gravel, and connected the triangle
426.123	to the storefronts on Grand Avenue,
428.118	created a great new public space,
430.116	and it's been great for businesses
432.13	along Grand Avenue.
433.713	We did the same thing in DUMBO, in Brooklyn,
436.869	and this is one of our first projects that we did,
439.297	and we took an underutilized,
441.892	pretty dingy-looking parking lot
444.573	and used some paint and planters
447.825	to transform it over a weekend.
450.711	And in the three years since we've implemented the project,
453.669	retail sales have increased 172 percent.
458.423	And that's twice that of adjacent areas in the same neighborhood.
463.295	We've moved very, very quickly
465.444	with paint and temporary materials.
467.693	Instead of waiting
468.95	through years of planning studies
471.773	and computer models to get something done,
474.151	we've done it with paint and temporary materials.
476.886	And the proof is not in a computer model.
479.236	It is in the real-world performance of the street.
482.201	You can have fun with paint.
485.197	All told, we've created over 50 pedestrian plazas
489.43	in all five boroughs across the city.
492.205	We've repurposed 26 acres of active car lanes
497.011	and turned them into new pedestrian space.
501.007	I think one of the successes is in its emulation.
504.448	You're seeing this kind of approach,
505.989	since we've painted Times Square,
507.544	you've seen this approach in Boston, in Chicago,
510.574	in San Francisco, in Mexico City,
513.073	Buenos Aires, you name it.
514.636	This is actually in Los Angeles,
516.985	and they actually copied even the green dots
520.608	that we had on the streets.
522.633	But I can't underscore enough
524.743	how much more quickly this enables you to move
527.32	over traditional construction methods.
530.442	We also brought this quick-acting approach
532.602	to our cycling program,
534.15	and in six years turned cycling
536.666	into a real transportation option in New York.
539.905	I think it's fair to say --
541.602	(Applause) --
546.841	it used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike,
550.305	and now New York has become
551.863	one of the cycling capitals in the United States.
555.908	And we moved quickly to create an interconnected
559.904	network of lanes.
562.339	You can see the map in 2007.
564.7	This is how it looked in 2013
566.894	after we built out 350 miles of on-street bike lanes.
571.49	I love this because it looks so easy.
573.507	You just click it, and they're there.
577.406	We also brought new designs to the street.
580.417	We created the first parking-protected bike lane
583.754	in the United States.
585.326	(Applause)
586.853	We protected bikers by floating parking lanes,
590.124	and it's been great.
591.637	Bike volumes have spiked.
593.364	Injuries to all users, pedestrians, cyclists, drivers,
595.998	are all down 50 percent.
597.789	And we've built 30 miles of these protected bike lanes,
601.052	and now you're seeing them pop up
602.591	all over the country.
604.46	And you can see here that this strategy has worked.
607.317	The blue line is the number of cyclists,
608.969	soaring.
609.973	The green line is the number of bike lanes.
611.916	And the yellow line is the number of injuries,
614.412	which has remained essentially flat.
616.897	After this big expansion, you've seen
619.765	no net increase in injuries,
621.615	and so there is something to that axiom
624.271	that there is safety in numbers.
627.518	Not everybody liked the new bike lanes,
630.65	and there was a lawsuit and somewhat
632.922	of a media frenzy a couple years ago.
635.894	One Brooklyn paper called this bike lane
638.141	that we have on Prospect Park West
640.595	"""the most contested piece of land"
642.483	"outside of the Gaza Strip."""
644.455	(Laughter)
647.834	And this is what we had done.
649.754	So if you dig below the headlines, though,
654.76	you'll see that the people were far ahead of the press,
657.653	far ahead of the politicians.
659.901	In fact, I think most politicians would be happy
662.089	to have those kind of poll numbers.
664.24	Sixty-four percent of New Yorkers support these bike lanes.
667.318	This summer, we launched Citi Bike,
669.297	the largest bike share program in the United States,
671.88	with 6,000 bikes
673.764	and 330 stations located next to one another.
677.326	Since we've launched the program,
679.334	three million trips have been taken.
681.002	People have ridden seven million miles.
683.771	That's 280 times around the globe.
686.633	And so with this little blue key,
688.704	you can unlock the keys to the city
691.337	and this brand new transportation option.
693.893	And daily usage just continues to soar.
696.252	What has happened is the average daily ridership
698.997	on the streets of New York is 36,000 people.
701.703	The high that we've had so far is 44,000 in August.
704.735	Yesterday, 40,000 people used Citi Bike in New York City.
708.624	The bikes are being used six times a day.
710.586	And I think you also see it in the kinds of riders
713.367	that are on the streets.
714.722	In the past, it looked like the guy on the left,
717.096	ninja-clad bike messenger.
720.101	And today, cyclists look
723.938	like New York City looks.
726.109	It's diverse -- young, old, black, white,
729.291	women, kids, all getting on a bike.
732.309	It's an affordable, safe, convenient way to get around.
735.326	Quite radical.
737.416	We've also brought this approach to our buses,
740.558	and New York City has the largest bus fleet in North America,
743.995	the slowest bus speeds.
745.436	As everybody knows,
746.515	you can walk across town faster
748.917	than you can take the bus.
750.137	And so we focused on the most congested areas
752.939	of New York City,
754.364	built out six bus rapid transit lines,
760.588	You pay at a kiosk before you get on the bus.
763.318	We've got dedicated lanes that keep cars out
765.704	because they get ticketed by a camera
767.83	if they use that lane,
769.343	and it's been a huge success.
772.985	I think one of my very favorite moments
775.025	as transportation commissioner was the day
777.311	that we launched Citi Bike,
778.808	and I was riding Citi Bike up First Avenue
781.858	in my protected bike lane,
783.218	and I looked over and I saw pedestrians
785.594	standing safely on the pedestrian islands,
788.222	and the traffic was flowing,
790.586	birds were singing --
792.536	(Laughter) --
793.891	the buses were speeding up their dedicated lanes.
796.977	It was just fantastic.
800.675	And this is how it looked six years ago.
803.546	And so, I think that the lesson that we have
806.99	from New York is that it's possible
810.469	to change your streets quickly,
813.177	it's not expensive, it can provide immediate benefits,
817.171	and it can be quite popular.
819.525	You just need to reimagine your streets.
822.804	They're hidden in plain sight.
824.869	Thank you.
826.267	(Applause)
