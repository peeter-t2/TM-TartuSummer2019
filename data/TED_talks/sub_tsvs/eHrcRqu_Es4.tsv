15.946	So what I want to try to do is tell a quick story
18.944	about a 404 page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it.
22.654	But to start it probably helps to have an understanding
25.373	of what a 404 page actually is.
28.885	The 404 page is that.
31.991	It's that broken experience on the Web.
34.331	It's effectively the default page
36.642	when you ask a website for something and it can't find it.
40.218	And it serves you the 404 page.
42.518	It's inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it.
47.343	And I just want you to think a little bit about, remember for yourself,
49.968	it's annoying when you hit this thing.
53.01	Because it's the feeling of a broken relationship.
55.268	And that's where it's actually also interesting to think about,
58.01	where does 404 come from?
59.885	It's from a family of errors actually --
61.929	a whole set of relationship errors,
64.039	which, when I started digging into them,
66.343	it looks almost like a checklist
66.343	for a sex therapist or a couples counselor.
71.177	You sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey.
74.302	(Laughter)
77.191	Yes.
79.218	But these things are everywhere.
81.462	They're on sites big, they're on sites small.
84.158	This is a global experience.
86.843	What a 404 page tells you
89.72	is that you fell through the cracks.
93.877	And that's not a good experience
95.635	when you're used to experiences like this.
98.079	You can get on your Kinect
99.352	and you can have unicorns dancing
101.51	and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone.
104.147	A 404 page is not what you're looking for.
106.237	You get that, and it's like a slap in the face.
109.689	Trying to think about how a 404 felt,
111.922	and it would be like if you went to Starbucks
113.802	and there's the guy behind the counter
115.552	and you're over there and there's no skim milk.
117.364	"And you say, ""Hey, could you bring the skim milk?"""
119.343	And they walk out from behind the counter and they've got no pants on.
121.508	"And you're like, ""Oh, I didn't want to see that."""
124.45	That's the 404 feeling.
126.554	(Laughter)
128.212	I mean, I've heard about that.
130.468	So where this comes into play and why this is important
134.606	is I head up a technology incubator,
135.937	and we had eight startups sitting around there.
137.937	And those startups are focused on what they are, not what they're not,
140.973	until one day Athletepath,
142.769	which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes,
146.447	found this video.
147.885	(Video) Guy: Joey!
151.45	Crowd: Whoa!
156.254	Renny Gleeson: You just ... no, he's not okay.
159.635	They took that video and they embedded it in their 404 page
163.678	and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place.
166.51	Because finally there was a page
169.218	that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a 404.
172.419	(Laughter)
173.945	(Applause)
175.726	So this turned into a contest.
178.093	Dailypath that offers inspiration
180.343	put inspiration on their 404 page.
182.839	Stayhound, which helps you find pet sitters through your social network,
186.755	commiserated with your pet.
188.575	Each one of them found this.
189.968	It turned into a 24-hour contest.
191.218	At 4:04 the next day, we gave out $404 in cash.
194.343	And what they learned
195.76	was that those little things, done right, actually matter,
198.144	and that well-designed moments can build brands.
200.79	So you take a look out in the real world,
202.718	and the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself.
205.16	You can type in an URL and put in a 404 and these will pop.
208.091	This is one that commiserates with you.
210.089	This is one that blames you.
211.839	This is one that I loved.
213.677	This is an error page,
216.01	but what if this error page was also an opportunity?
220.056	So it was a moment in time
222.222	where all of these startups had to sit and think
224.493	and got really excited about what they could be.
226.815	Because back to the whole relationship issue,
229.412	what they figured out through this exercise
231.669	was that a simple mistake can tell me what you're not,
234.506	or it can remind me of why I should love you.
237.825	Thank you.
239.583	(Applause)
