12.844	So this is a talk about gene drives,
15.33	but I'm going to start
15.33	by telling you a brief story.
	named Anthony James
21.868	got obsessed with the idea
21.868	of making mosquitos
24.211	that didn't transmit malaria.
27.683	It was a great idea,
27.683	and pretty much a complete failure.
32.596	For one thing, it turned out
32.596	to be really hard
35.28	to make a malaria-resistant mosquito.
38.286	James managed it, finally,
38.286	just a few years ago,
41.937	by adding some genes
41.937	that make it impossible
44.032	for the malaria parasite
44.032	to survive inside the mosquito.
47.551	But that just created another problem.
50.043	Now that you've got
50.043	a malaria-resistant mosquito,
52.909	how do you get it to replace
52.909	all the malaria-carrying mosquitos?
58.107	There are a couple options,
59.604	but plan A was basically to breed up
61.651	a bunch of the new
61.651	genetically-engineered mosquitos
64.762	release them into the wild
66.112	and hope that they pass on their genes.
68.673	The problem was that you'd have to release
70.811	literally 10 times the number
70.811	of native mosquitos to work.
75.135	So in a village with 10,000 mosquitos,
77.246	you release an extra 100,000.
80.229	As you might guess,
81.403	this was not a very popular strategy
81.403	with the villagers.
84.181	(Laughter)
86.963	Then, last January,
86.963	Anthony James got an email
90.691	from a biologist named Ethan Bier.
93.4	Bier said that he
93.4	and his grad student Valentino Gantz
96.283	had stumbled on a tool
96.283	that could not only guarantee
99.251	that a particular genetic trait
99.251	would be inherited,
101.949	but that it would spread
101.949	incredibly quickly.
104.734	If they were right,
104.734	it would basically solve the problem
107.424	that he and James had been
107.424	working on for 20 years.
110.45	As a test, they engineered two mosquitos
110.45	to carry the anti-malaria gene
115.132	and also this new tool, a gene drive,
117.315	which I'll explain in a minute.
119.506	Finally, they set it up
119.506	so that any mosquitos
121.863	that had inherited the anti-malaria gene
123.825	wouldn't have the usual white eyes,
123.825	but would instead have red eyes.
128.682	That was pretty much just for convenience
130.756	so they could tell just at a glance
130.756	which was which.
134.192	So they took their two
134.192	anti-malarial, red-eyed mosquitos
136.973	and put them in a box
136.973	with 30 ordinary white-eyed ones,
139.656	and let them breed.
141.383	In two generations, those had produced
141.383	3,800 grandchildren.
146.217	That is not the surprising part.
148.716	This is the surprising part:
150.662	given that you started
150.662	with just two red-eyed mosquitos
153.593	and 30 white-eyed ones,
154.951	you expect mostly white-eyed descendants.
158.514	Instead, when James opened the box,
161.562	all 3,800 mosquitos had red eyes.
165.315	When I asked Ethan Bier about this moment,
167.379	he became so excited that he was literally
167.379	shouting into the phone.
171.886	That's because getting
171.886	only red-eyed mosquitos
174.073	violates a rule that is the absolute
174.073	cornerstone of biology,
177.045	Mendelian genetics.
178.912	I'll keep this quick,
180.105	but Mendelian genetics
180.105	says when a male and a female mate,
182.893	their baby inherits half
182.893	of its DNA from each parent.
185.559	So if our original mosquito was aa
185.559	and our new mosquito is aB,
189.178	where B is the anti-malarial gene,
191.004	the babies should come out
191.004	in four permutations:
193.415	aa, aB, aa, Ba.
196.884	Instead, with the new gene drive,
199.197	they all came out aB.
201.9	Biologically, that shouldn't
201.9	even be possible.
204.476	So what happened?
206.709	The first thing that happened
208.177	was the arrival of a gene-editing tool
208.177	known as CRISPR in 2012.
212.701	Many of you have probably
212.701	heard about CRISPR,
214.835	so I'll just say briefly that CRISPR
214.835	is a tool that allows researchers
218.16	to edit genes very precisely,
218.16	easily and quickly.
221.533	It does this by harnessing a mechanism
221.533	that already existed in bacteria.
225.286	Basically, there's a protein
225.286	that acts like a scissors
227.936	and cuts the DNA,
229.194	and there's an RNA molecule
229.194	that directs the scissors
231.701	to any point on the genome you want.
233.443	The result is basically
233.443	a word processor for genes.
236.157	You can take an entire gene
236.157	out, put one in,
238.807	or even edit just a single
238.807	letter within a gene.
241.646	And you can do it in nearly any species.
245.328	OK, remember how I said that gene drives
245.328	originally had two problems?
249.835	The first was that it was hard
249.835	to engineer a mosquito
252.979	to be malaria-resistant.
254.39	That's basically gone now,
254.39	thanks to CRISPR.
257.117	But the other problem was logistical.
259.307	How do you get your trait to spread?
262.196	This is where it gets clever.
264.943	A couple years ago, a biologist
264.943	at Harvard named Kevin Esvelt
268.569	wondered what would happen
269.943	if you made it so that
269.943	CRISPR inserted not only your new gene
273.594	but also the machinery
273.594	that does the cutting and pasting.
277.233	In other words, what if CRISPR
277.233	also copied and pasted itself.
282.145	You'd end up with a perpetual
282.145	motion machine for gene editing.
286.458	And that's exactly what happened.
289.037	This CRISPR gene drive that Esvelt created
291.939	not only guarantees
291.939	that a trait will get passed on,
295.606	but if it's used in the germline cells,
298.068	it will automatically copy and paste
298.068	your new gene
300.668	into both chromosomes
300.668	of every single individual.
303.743	It's like a global search and replace,
306.164	or in science terms, it makes
306.164	a heterozygous trait homozygous.
311.045	So, what does this mean?
313.68	For one thing, it means we have
313.68	a very powerful,
316.428	but also somewhat alarming new tool.
320.576	Up until now, the fact that gene drives
320.576	didn't work very well
323.489	was actually kind of a relief.
325.425	Normally when we mess around
325.425	with an organism's genes,
328.131	we make that thing
328.131	less evolutionarily fit.
330.504	So biologists can make
330.504	all the mutant fruit flies they want
333.361	without worrying about it.
334.638	If some escape, natural selection
334.638	just takes care of them.
338.75	What's remarkable and powerful
338.75	and frightening about gene drives
341.997	is that that will no longer be true.
345.092	Assuming that your trait does not have
345.092	a big evolutionary handicap,
348.68	like a mosquito that can't fly,
350.783	the CRISPR-based gene drive
350.783	will spread the change relentlessly
354.26	until it is in every single individual
354.26	in the population.
359.101	Now, it isn't easy to make
359.101	a gene drive that works that well,
362.014	but James and Esvelt think that we can.
365.339	The good news is that this opens
365.339	the door to some remarkable things.
369.187	If you put an anti-malarial gene drive
371.115	in just 1 percent of Anopheles mosquitoes,
373.339	the species that transmits malaria,
375.488	researchers estimate that it would spread
375.488	to the entire population in a year.
380.178	So in a year, you could virtually
380.178	eliminate malaria.
383.455	In practice, we're still a few years out
383.455	from being able to do that,
387.351	but still, a 1,000 children
387.351	a day die of malaria.
390.093	In a year, that number
390.093	could be almost zero.
392.966	The same goes for dengue fever,
392.966	chikungunya, yellow fever.
397.211	And it gets better.
399.215	Say you want to get rid
399.215	of an invasive species,
401.715	like get Asian carp
401.715	out of the Great Lakes.
404.434	All you have to do is release a gene drive
406.482	that makes the fish produce
406.482	only male offspring.
409.386	In a few generations,
409.386	there'll be no females left, no more carp.
413.608	In theory, this means we could restore
413.608	hundreds of native species
416.711	that have been pushed to the brink.
419.41	OK, that's the good news,
422.721	this is the bad news.
425.07	Gene drives are so effective
427.122	that even an accidental release
427.122	could change an entire species,
430.971	and often very quickly.
433.178	Anthony James took good precautions.
435.328	He bred his mosquitos
435.328	in a bio-containment lab
437.518	and he also used a species
437.518	that's not native to the US
440.13	so that even if some did escape,
441.709	they'd just die off, there'd be nothing
441.709	for them to mate with.
444.748	But it's also true that if a dozen
444.748	Asian carp with the all-male gene drive
448.795	accidentally got carried
448.795	from the Great Lakes back to Asia,
452.748	they could potentially wipe out
452.748	the native Asian carp population.
457.93	And that's not so unlikely,
457.93	given how connected our world is.
460.866	In fact, it's why we have
460.866	an invasive species problem.
463.912	And that's fish.
465.428	Things like mosquitos and fruit flies,
468.04	there's literally no way to contain them.
470.024	They cross borders
470.024	and oceans all the time.
473.754	OK, the other piece of bad news
475.96	is that a gene drive
475.96	might not stay confined
478.302	to what we call the target species.
480.556	That's because of gene flow,
482.079	which is a fancy way of saying
482.079	that neighboring species
484.7	sometimes interbreed.
485.972	If that happens, it's possible
485.972	a gene drive could cross over,
489.147	like Asian carp could infect
489.147	some other kind of carp.
491.698	That's not so bad if your drive
491.698	just promotes a trait, like eye color.
495.437	In fact, there's a decent
495.437	chance that we'll see
497.708	a wave of very weird fruit flies
497.708	in the near future.
501.39	But it could be a disaster
502.677	if your drive is deigned
502.677	to eliminate the species entirely.
506.351	The last worrisome thing
506.351	is that the technology to do this,
509.903	to genetically engineer an organism
509.903	and include a gene drive,
513.618	is something that basically any lab
513.618	in the world can do.
516.976	An undergraduate can do it.
519.209	A talented high schooler
519.209	with some equipment can do it.
524.526	Now, I'm guessing
524.526	that this sounds terrifying.
527.351	(Laughter)
529.581	Interestingly though,
529.581	nearly every scientist I talk to
532.495	seemed to think that gene drives were not
532.495	actually that frightening or dangerous.
536.4	Partly because they believe
536.4	that scientists will be
539.052	very cautious and responsible
539.052	about using them.
541.28	(Laughter)
542.318	So far, that's been true.
544.302	But gene drives also have
544.302	some actual limitations.
547.022	So for one thing, they work
547.022	only in sexually reproducing species.
550.704	So thank goodness, they can't be used
550.704	to engineer viruses or bacteria.
554.156	Also, the trait spreads
554.156	only with each successive generation.
557.37	So changing or eliminating a population
559.387	is practical only if that species
559.387	has a fast reproductive cycle,
562.737	like insects or maybe
562.737	small vertebrates like mice or fish.
566.438	In elephants or people,
566.438	it would take centuries
568.723	for a trait to spread
568.723	widely enough to matter.
572.079	Also, even with CRISPR, it's not that easy
572.079	to engineer a truly devastating trait.
578.079	Say you wanted to make a fruit fly
579.832	that feeds on ordinary fruit
579.832	instead of rotting fruit,
582.411	with the aim of sabotaging
582.411	American agriculture.
585.068	First, you'd have to figure out
586.622	which genes control
586.622	what the fly wants to eat,
589.418	which is already a very long
589.418	and complicated project.
592.489	Then you'd have to alter those genes
592.489	to change the fly's behavior
595.817	to whatever you'd want it to be,
597.379	which is an even longer
597.379	and more complicated project.
600.204	And it might not even work,
601.546	because the genes
601.546	that control behavior are complex.
604.064	So if you're a terrorist
604.064	and have to choose
606.096	between starting a grueling
606.096	basic research program
608.478	that will require years of meticulous
608.478	lab work and still might not pan out,
612.029	or just blowing stuff up?
613.4	You'll probably choose the later.
615.498	This is especially true
615.498	because at least in theory,
617.942	it should be pretty easy
617.942	to build what's called a reversal drive.
621.1	That's one that basically overwrites
621.1	the change made by the first gene drive.
624.822	So if you don't like
624.822	the effects of a change,
627.14	you can just release a second drive
627.14	that will cancel it out,
629.997	at least in theory.
633.374	OK, so where does this leave us?
636.604	We now have the ability
636.604	to change entire species at will.
641.017	Should we?
642.552	Are we gods now?
645.972	I'm not sure I'd say that.
648.094	But I would say this:
650.329	first, some very smart people
652.211	are even now debating
652.211	how to regulate gene drives.
655.598	At the same time,
655.598	some other very smart people
658.186	are working hard to create safeguards,
660.321	like gene drives that self-regulate
660.321	or peter out after a few generations.
664.644	That's great.
666.313	But this technology still requires
666.313	a conversation.
670.059	And given the nature of gene drives,
671.813	that conversation has to be global.
674.131	What if Kenya wants to use a drive
674.131	but Tanzania doesn't?
677.241	Who decides whether to release
677.241	a gene drive that can fly?
682.874	I don't have the answer to that question.
685.618	All we can do going forward, I think,
687.65	is talk honestly
687.65	about the risks and benefits
690.508	and take responsibility for our choices.
693.817	By that I mean, not just the choice
693.817	to use a gene drive,
697.754	but also the choice not to use one.
701.111	Humans have a tendency to assume
701.111	that the safest option
704.112	is to preserve the status quo.
706.905	But that's not always the case.
709.711	Gene drives have risks,
709.711	and those need to be discussed,
713.136	but malaria exists now
713.136	and kills 1,000 people a day.
716.977	To combat it, we spray pesticides
716.977	that do grave damage to other species,
720.565	including amphibians and birds.
723.668	So when you hear about gene drives
723.668	in the coming months,
726.556	and trust me, you will
726.556	be hearing about them,
728.834	remember that.
730.402	It can be frightening to act,
732.446	but sometimes, not acting is worse.
736.746	(Applause)
