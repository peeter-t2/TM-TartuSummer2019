90.956	You probably all agree with me
92.981	that this is a very nice road.
95.756	It's made of asphalt,
97.915	and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on,
101.149	but not always, especially not on these days as today,
105.283	when it's raining a lot.
107.134	Then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt.
110.082	And especially if you then ride with your bicycle,
112.376	and pass these cars, then that's not very nice.
116.321	Also, asphalt can create a lot of noise.
119.431	It's a noisy material,
121.045	and if we produce roads like in the Netherlands,
123.489	very close to cities, then we would like a silent road.
127.621	The solution for that is to make roads
130.89	out of porous asphalt.
133.067	Porous asphalt, a material that we use now
135.058	in most of the highways in the Netherlands,
138.017	it has pores and water can just rain through it,
141.461	so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides,
144.362	and you have a road that's easy to drive on,
146.451	so no splash water anymore.
148.381	Also the noise will disappear in these pores.
151.543	Because it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear,
154.566	so it's a very silent road.
157.154	It also has disadvantages, of course,
160.699	and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur.
164.861	What is raveling? You see that in this road
167.786	that the stones at the surface come off.
170.407	First you get one stone, then several more,
175.685	and more and more and more and more,
177.427	and then they -- well, I will not do that. (Laughter)
180.994	But they can damage your windshield,
183.908	so you're not happy with that.
185.698	And finally, this raveling can also lead to more and more damage.
189.688	Sometimes you can create potholes with that.
192.304	Ha. He's ready.
196.365	Potholes, of course, that can become a problem,
199.55	but we have a solution.
201.093	Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material.
204.351	It's a porous asphalt, like I said, so you have only
206.351	a small amount of binder between the stones.
209.123	Due to weathering, due to U.V. light, due to oxidation,
212.442	this binder, this bitumen,
215.17	the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink,
217.843	and if it shrinks, it gets micro-cracks,
219.788	and it delaminates from the aggregates.
221.51	Then if you drive over the road, you take out the aggregates --
224.07	what we just saw here.
227.066	To solve this problem, we thought of self-healing materials.
230.88	If we can make this material self-healing,
233.541	then probably we have a solution.
236.734	So what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans,
241.328	and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces,
244.813	and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen.
248.717	So then you have asphalt
250.462	with very small pieces of steel wool in it.
253.529	Then you need a machine, like you see here,
256.32	that you can use for cooking -- an induction machine.
259.459	Induction can heat, especially steel; it's very good at that.
263.508	Then what you do is you heat up the steel,
266.19	you melt the bitumen,
267.681	and the bitumen will flow into these micro-cracks,
270.247	and the stones are again fixed to the surface.
273.454	Today I use a microwave because I cannot take
277.416	the big induction machine here onstage.
279.653	So a microwave is a similar system.
282.533	So I put the specimen in, which I'm now going to take out
286.178	to see what happened.
289.43	So this is the specimen coming out now.
291.923	So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab
296.316	to heat up the specimens.
298.588	We tested a lot of specimens there,
300.678	and then the government, they actually saw our results,
303.853	"and they thought, ""Well, that's very interesting. We have to try that."""
307.803	So they donated to us a piece of highway,
313.606	a test track to test this material.
316.116	So that's what we did here. You see where we were making the test road,
319.648	and then of course this road will last several years
324.146	without any damage. That's what we know from practice.
327.434	So we took a lot of samples from this road
330.213	and we tested them in the lab.
332.482	So we did aging on the samples,
335.399	did a lot of loading on it, healed them with our induction machine,
339.011	and healed them and tested them again.
341.837	Several times we can repeat that.
343.741	So actually, the conclusion from this research is that
345.966	if we go on the road every four years
349.284	with our healing machine -- this is the big version
352.164	we have made to go on the real road --
354.069	if we go on the road every four years
355.939	we can double the surface life of this road,
359.689	which of course saves a lot of money.
361.866	Well, to conclude, I can say
364.043	that we made a material
366.799	using steel fibers, the addition of steel fibers,
370.579	using induction energy to really
373.088	increase the surface life of the road,
375.755	double the surface life you can even do,
377.505	so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
381.169	And now you're of course curious if it also worked.
384.642	So we still have the specimen here. It's quite warm.
387.745	Actually, it still has to cool down first
390.324	before I can show you that the healing works.
392.664	But I will do a trial.
395.532	Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
398.291	Thank you.
399.641	(Applause)
