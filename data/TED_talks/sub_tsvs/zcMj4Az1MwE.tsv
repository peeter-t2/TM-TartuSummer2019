13.208	When I die,
14.845	I would like for my body
14.845	to be laid out to be eaten by animals.
20.92	Having your body laid out to be eaten
20.92	by animals is not for everyone.
25.655	(Laughter)
26.712	Maybe you have already had
26.712	the end-of-life talk with your family
30.689	and decided on,
30.689	I don't know, cremation.
34.833	And in the interest of full disclosure,
37.423	what I am proposing for my dead body
37.423	is not strictly legal at the moment,
43.435	but it's not without precedent.
45.924	We've been laying out our dead
45.924	for all of human history;
49.536	it's call exposure burial.
52.096	In fact, it's likely happening
52.096	right now as we speak.
56.684	In the mountainous regions of Tibet,
58.939	"they practice ""sky burial,"""
61.027	a ritual where the body is left
61.027	to be consumed by vultures.
65.545	In Mumbai, in India,
65.545	those who follow the Parsi religion
70.795	put their dead in structures
70.795	"called ""Towers of Silence."""
75.487	These are interesting cultural tidbits,
78.055	but they just haven't really been
78.055	that popular in the Western world --
82.527	they're not what you'd expect.
84.978	In America, our death traditions
84.978	have come to be chemical embalming,
90.032	followed by burial at your local cemetery,
93.437	or, more recently, cremation.
96.843	I myself, am a recent vegetarian,
100.13	which means I spent the first
103.773	frantically inhaling animals --
106.004	as many as I could get my hands on.
108.706	Why, when I die, should they not
108.706	have their turn with me?
113.31	(Laughter)
115.101	Am I not an animal?
117.005	Biologically speaking,
117.005	are we not all, in this room, animals?
122.949	Accepting the fact that we are animals
125.625	has some potentially
125.625	terrifying consequences.
129.22	It means accepting
129.22	that we are doomed to decay and die,
133.272	just like any other creature on earth.
138.076	For the last nine years,
138.076	I've worked in the funeral industry,
141.714	first as a crematory operator,
143.869	then as a mortician
145.371	and most recently, as the owner
145.371	of my own funeral home.
149.162	And I have some good news:
150.918	if you're looking to avoid the whole
150.918	"""doomed to decay and die"" thing:"
156.514	you will have all the help
156.514	in the world in that avoidance
160.754	from the funeral industry.
163.64	It's a multi-billion-dollar industry,
165.829	and its economic model
165.829	is based on the principle
168.837	of protection, sanitation
168.837	and beautification of the corpse.
175.43	Whether they mean to or not,
177.626	the funeral industry promotes
177.626	this idea of human exceptionalism.
182.636	It doesn't matter what it takes,
184.302	how much it costs,
185.618	how bad it is for the environment,
187.6	we're going to do it
187.6	because humans are worth it!
191.767	It ignores the fact
193.379	that death can be an emotionally messy
193.379	and complex affair,
198.49	and that there is beauty in decay --
201.058	beauty in the natural return
201.058	to the earth from whence we came.
207	Now, I don't want you to get me wrong --
208.94	I absolutely understand
208.94	the importance of ritual,
211.951	especially when it comes
211.951	to the people that we love.
215.076	But we have to be able
215.076	to create and practice this ritual
218.635	without harming the environment,
220.44	which is why we need new options.
224.235	So let's return to the idea of protection,
224.235	sanitation and beautification.
229.299	We'll start with a dead body.
231.672	The funeral industry
231.672	will protect your dead body
234.715	by offering to sell your family a casket
234.715	made of hardwood or metal
239.58	with a rubber sealant.
242.083	At the cemetery, on the day of burial,
242.083	that casket will be lowered
245.678	into a large concrete or metal vault.
249.573	We're wasting all of these resources --
249.573	concretes, metal, hardwoods --
253.521	hiding them in vast
253.521	underground fortresses.
258.12	When you choose burial at the cemetery,
260.692	your dead body is not coming anywhere
260.692	near the dirt that surrounds it.
266.57	Food for worms
268.148	you are not.
270.477	Next, the industry will sanitize
270.477	your body through embalming:
275.32	the chemical preservation of the dead.
278.126	This procedure drains your blood
280.084	and replaces it with a toxic,
280.084	cancer-causing formaldehyde.
285.469	They say they do this
285.469	for the public health
287.836	because the dead body can be dangerous,
290.71	but the doctors in this room will tell you
293.233	that that claim would only apply
296.011	if the person had died of some wildly
296.011	infectious disease, like Ebola.
301.841	Even human decomposition,
301.841	which, let's be honest,
305.104	is a little stinky and unpleasant,
308.118	is perfectly safe.
310.615	The bacteria that causes disease
310.615	is not the same bacteria
315.147	that causes decomposition.
318.476	Finally, the industry
318.476	will beautify the corpse.
323.001	They'll tell you that the natural
323.001	dead body of your mother or father
326.914	is not good enough as it is.
329.485	They'll put it in makeup.
331.237	They'll put it in a suit.
333.052	They'll inject dyes so the person
333.052	looks a little more alive --
337.015	just resting.
339.492	Embalming is a cheat code,
341.782	providing the illusion that death
341.782	and then decay are not the natural end
346.203	for all organic life on this planet.
350.429	Now, if this system of beautification,
350.429	sanitation, protection
355.471	doesn't appeal to you,
357.688	you are not alone.
359.65	There is a whole wave of people --
361.65	funeral directors, designers,
361.65	environmentalists --
364.638	trying to come up with a more
364.638	eco-friendly way of death.
369.201	For these people, death is not necessarily
371.707	a pristine, makeup,
371.707	powder-blue tuxedo kind of affair.
376.566	There's no question
377.988	that our current methods of death
377.988	are not particularly sustainable,
381.939	what with the waste of resources
381.939	and our reliance on chemicals.
386.318	Even cremation,
387.684	which is usually considered
387.684	the environmentally friendly option,
391.426	uses, per cremation,
393.688	the natural gas equivalent
393.688	of a 500-mile car trip.
399.748	So where do we go from here?
403.188	Last summer, I was in the mountains
403.188	of North Carolina,
406.564	hauling buckets of wood chips
406.564	in the summer sun.
410.561	I was at Western Carolina University
410.561	"at their ""Body Farm,"""
414.774	more accurately called
414.774	"a ""human decomposition facility."""
419.614	Bodies donated to science
419.614	are brought here,
421.883	and their decay is studied
421.883	to benefit the future of forensics.
426.64	On this particular day,
427.952	there were 12 bodies laid out
427.952	in various stages of decomposition.
432.547	Some were skeletonized,
434.852	one was wearing purple pajamas,
437.248	one still had blonde facial hair visible.
441.03	The forensic aspect is really fascinating,
443.963	but not actually why I was there.
446.383	I was there because a colleague of mine
446.383	named Katrina Spade
449.669	is attempting to create a system,
449.669	not of cremating the dead,
454.033	but composting the dead.
456.745	"She calls the system ""Recomposition,"""
459.287	and we've been doing it with cattle
459.287	and other livestock for years.
463.465	She imagines a facility
465.013	where the family could come
465.013	and lay their dead loved one
467.663	in a nutrient-rich mixture that would,
467.663	in four-to-six weeks,
472.118	reduce the body -- bones
472.118	and all -- to soil.
476.622	In those four-to-six weeks,
478.091	your molecules become other molecules;
480.573	you literally transform.
483.526	How would this fit in
483.526	with the very recent desire
486.603	a lot of people seem to have
488.229	to be buried under a tree,
489.758	or to become a tree when they die?
492.53	In a traditional cremation,
492.53	the ashes that are left over --
496.084	inorganic bone fragments --
498.094	form a thick, chalky layer
500.369	that, unless distributed
500.369	in the soil just right,
503.616	can actually hurt or kill the tree.
507.372	But if you're recomposed,
507.372	if you actually become the soil,
510.701	you can nourish the tree,
512.259	and become the post-mortem contributor
512.259	you've always wanted to be --
515.972	that you deserve to be.
518.638	So that's one option
518.638	for the future of cremation.
522.005	But what about the future of cemeteries?
524.932	There are a lot of people who think
524.932	we shouldn't even have cemeteries anymore
529.021	because we're running out of land.
531.797	But what if we reframed it,
534.034	and the corpse wasn't the land's enemy,
536.663	but its potential savior?
539.625	I'm talking about conservation burial,
542.202	where large swaths of land
542.202	are purchased by a land trust.
547.094	The beauty of this is that once you plant
547.094	a few dead bodies in that land,
551.948	it can't be touched,
551.948	it can't be developed on --
554.99	"hence the term, ""conservation burial."""
557.812	It's the equivalent of chaining yourself
557.812	to a tree post-mortem --
561.718	"""Hell no, I won't go!"
564.206	No, really -- I can't.
564.206	"I'm decomposing under here."""
567.275	(Laughter)
568.394	Any money that the family
568.394	gives to the cemetery
570.739	would go back into protecting
570.739	and managing the land.
575.196	There are no headstones
575.196	and no graves in the typical sense.
579.619	The graves are scattered
579.619	about the property
581.79	under elegant mounds,
583.374	marked only by a rock
583.374	or a small metal disk,
587.079	or sometimes only locatable by GPS.
590.563	There's no embalming,
592.261	no heavy, metal caskets.
595.12	My funeral home sells a few caskets
597.349	made out of things like
597.349	woven willow and bamboo,
601.125	but honestly, most of our families
601.125	just choose a simple shroud.
605.799	There are none of the big vaults
605.799	that most cemeteries require
609.663	just because it makes it easier
609.663	for them to landscape.
613.921	Families can come here;
613.921	they can luxuriate in nature;
617.477	they can even plant a tree or a shrub,
620.178	though only native plants
620.178	to the area are allowed.
623.874	The dead then blend seamlessly
623.874	in with the landscape.
628.079	There's hope in conservation cemeteries.
631.911	They offer dedicated green space
631.911	in both urban and rural areas.
637.567	They offer a chance to reintroduce
637.567	native plants and animals to a region.
642.742	They offer public trails,
644.739	places for spiritual practice,
646.811	places for classes and events --
649.95	places where nature and mourning meet.
654.271	Most importantly,
654.271	they offer us, once again,
657.691	a chance to just decompose
657.691	in a hole in the ground.
663.786	The soil,
665.199	let me tell you,
666.891	has missed us.
668.975	I think for a lot of people,
671.031	they're starting to get the sense
672.652	that our current funeral industry
672.652	isn't really working for them.
678.118	For many of us,
679.332	being sanitized and beautified
679.332	just doesn't reflect us.
683.767	It doesn't reflect
683.767	what we stood for during our lives.
687.834	Will changing the way we bury our dead
687.834	solve climate change?
692.269	No.
693.872	But it will make bold moves
695.921	in how we see ourselves
695.921	as citizens of this planet.
700.474	If we can die in a way
700.474	that is more humble and self-aware,
705.106	I believe that we stand a chance.
708.052	Thank you.
709.32	(Applause)
