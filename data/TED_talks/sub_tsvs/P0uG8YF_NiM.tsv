25	♫ Slide into the shimmering surface ♫
28	♫ between two worlds. ♫
34	♫ Standing at the center of time ♫
37	♫ as it uncurls. ♫
42	♫ Cutting through the veil of illusion. ♫
46	♫ Moving beyond past conclusions. ♫
50	♫ Wondering if all my doubt and confusion will clear. ♫
57	♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫
61	♫ if I could be anywhere, ♫
66	♫ if I could be anywhere right now, ♫
69	♫ I would want to be here. ♫
75	♫ Searching for the future ♫
77	♫ among the things we're throwing away. ♫
83	♫ Trying to see the world ♫
85	♫ through the junk we produce everyday. ♫
92	♫ They say nothing lasts forever, ♫
95	♫ but all the plastic ever made is still here. ♫
99	♫ And no amount of closing our eyes ♫
102	♫ will make it disappear. ♫
107	♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫
111	♫ if I could be anywhere, ♫
115	♫ if I could be anywhere in history, ♫
118	♫ I would want to be here. ♫
124	♫ The Romans, the Spanish ♫
126	♫ the British, the Dutch, ♫
128	♫ American exceptionalism, so out of touch. ♫
132	♫ The folly of empire repeating its course, ♫
136	♫ imposing its will ♫
138	♫ and ruling by force ♫
141	♫ on and on through time. ♫
144	♫ But the world can't take it very much longer. ♫
148	♫ We're not going to make it ♫
150	♫ unless we're smarter and stronger. ♫
152	♫ The world is going to shake itself free of our greed ♫
156	♫ somehow. ♫
163	♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫
167	♫ if I could be anywhere in time, ♫
172	♫ if I could be anywhere and change things, ♫
175	♫ it would have to be now. ♫
181	♫ They say nothing last forever, ♫
184	♫ but all the plastic ever made is still here. ♫
189	♫ And no amount of closing our eyes ♫
191	♫ will make it disappear. ♫
196	♫ And the world can't take it ♫
199	♫ very much longer. ♫
201	♫ We're not going to make it ♫
203	♫ unless we're smarter and stronger. ♫
205	♫ The world's gonna shake itself free of our greed ♫
209	♫ somehow. ♫
212	♫ And the world can't take it, that you can see. ♫
216	♫ If the oceans don't make it, neither will we. ♫
221	♫ The world's gonna shake itself all the way free ♫
225	♫ somehow. ♫
228	♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫
232	♫ if I could be anywhere in time, ♫
236	♫ if I could be anywhere and change the outcome, ♫
241	♫ it would have to be now. ♫
246	(Applause)
249	Thank you.
