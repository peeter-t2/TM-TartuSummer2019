12.833	We need to change the culture
12.833	in our jails and prisons,
17.013	especially for young inmates.
19.52	New York state is one
19.52	of only two in the U.S.
21.842	that automatically arrests and tries
26.95	This culture of violence
26.95	takes these young people
29.297	and puts them in a hostile environment,
31.339	and the correctional officers pretty much
31.339	allow any and everything to go on.
35.381	There's not really much
35.381	for these young people to do
38.188	to actually enhance their talent
38.188	and actually rehabilitate them.
43.038	Until we can raise the age
43.038	of criminal responsibility to 18,
46.284	we need to focus on changing
46.284	the daily lives of these young people.
50.155	I know firsthand.
52.329	Before I ever turned 18,
53.908	I spent approximately
57.855	and to add to that
59.109	I spent almost 300 days
59.109	in solitary confinement,
62.963	and let me tell you this:
65.68	Screaming at the top of your lungs
65.68	all day on your cell door
68.768	or screaming at the top
68.768	of your lungs out the window,
71.345	it gets tiring.
73.267	Since there's not much for you to do
73.267	while you're in there,
76.064	you start pacing
76.064	back and forth in your cell,
78.347	you start talking to yourself,
80.483	your thoughts start running wild,
82.48	and then your thoughts
82.48	become your own worst enemy.
85.963	Jails are actually supposed
85.963	to rehabilitate a person,
88.958	not cause him or her
88.958	to become more angry,
91.651	frustrated, and feel more hopeless.
94.391	Since there's not a discharge plan
94.391	put in place for these young people,
98.294	they pretty much 
98.294	reenter society with nothing.
103.168	And there's not really much for them to do
103.168	to keep them from recidivating.
107.823	But it all starts with the C.O.s.
110.545	It's very easy for some people
112.513	to look at these correctional officers
112.513	as the good guys
115.207	and the inmates as the bad guys,
117.482	or vice versa for some,
119.178	but it's a little more than that.
120.849	See, these C.O.s are normal,
120.849	everyday people.
123.844	They come from the same neighborhoods
123.844	"as the population they ""serve."""
129.725	They're just normal people.
131.597	They're not robots, and there's 
131.597	nothing special about them.
135.261	They do pretty much everything
135.261	anybody else in society does.
139.023	The male C.O.s want to talk
139.023	and flirt with the female C.O.s.
142.922	They play the little high school
142.922	kid games with each other.
145.731	They politic with one another.
147.635	And the female C.O.s gossip to each other.
151.954	So I spent numerous amounts of time
151.954	with numerous amounts of C.O.s,
157.944	and let me tell you about
157.944	this one in particular named Monroe.
160.856	One day he pulled me
160.856	in between the A and B doors
163.354	which separate the north
163.354	and south sides of our housing unit.
166.673	He pulled me there because I had
166.673	a physical altercation
169.27	with another young man in my housing unit,
171.29	and he felt, since there was
171.29	a female officer working on the floor,
174.773	that I violated his shift.
177.258	So he punched me in my chest.
179.255	He kind of knocked the wind out of me.
181.391	I wasn't impulsive,
181.391	I didn't react right away,
184.248	because I know this is their house.
186.896	I have no wins.
188.746	All he has to do is pull his pin
188.746	and backup will come immediately.
195.084	So I just gave him a look in his eyes
197.645	and I guess he saw the anger
197.645	and frustration just burning,
200.904	and he said to me,
202.869	"""Your eyes are going to get you"
202.869	in a lot of trouble,
205.331	because you're looking
205.331	"like you want to fight."""
207.837	So he commenced
207.837	to taking off his utility belt,
210.206	he took off his shirt and his badge,
212.297	"and he said, ""We could fight."""
214.334	"So I asked him, ""You gonna hold it down?"""
217.151	Now, that's a term that's
217.151	commonly used on Rikers Island
220.064	meaning that you're not
220.064	going to say anything to anybody,
222.731	and you're not going to report it.
224.958	"He said, ""Yeah, I'm gonna hold it down."
224.958	"You gonna hold it down?"""
228.735	I didn't even respond.
230.406	I just punched him right in his face,
232.331	and we began fighting
232.331	right then and there.
235.027	Towards the end of the fight,
235.027	he slammed me up against the wall,
239.347	so while we were tussled up,
239.347	"he said to me, ""You good?"""
242.852	as if he got the best of me,
244.617	but in my mind, I know
244.617	I got the best of him,
247.241	so I replied very cocky,
249.244	"""Oh, I'm good, you good?"""
251.372	"He said, ""Yeah, I'm good, "
251.372	"I'm good."""
253.366	We let go, he shook my hand,
253.366	said he gave me my respect,
257.532	gave me a cigarette and sent me on my way.
261.723	Believe it or not, you come across
261.723	some C.O.s on Rikers Island
265.464	that'll fight you one-on-one.
268.04	They feel that they understand how it is,
270.247	and they feel that I'm going
270.247	to meet you where you're at.
273.055	Since this is how you commonly
273.055	handle your disputes,
275.551	we can handle it in that manner.
277.63	I walk away from it like a man,
277.63	you walk away from it like a man,
280.904	and that's it.
282.325	Some C.O.s feel that
282.325	they're jailing with you.
284.477	This is why they have that mentality
284.477	and that attitude
287.047	and they go by that concept.
289.078	In some instances, we're in it
289.078	together with the C.O.s.
292.543	However, institutions need to give
292.543	these correctional officers
295.617	proper trainings on how to properly deal
295.617	with the adolescent population,
298.995	and they also need
298.995	to give them proper trainings
301.24	on how to deal with 
301.24	the mental health population as well.
304.777	These C.O.s play a big factor
304.777	in these young people's lives
308.086	for x amount of time until a disposition
308.086	is reached on their case.
311.444	So why not try to mentor
311.444	these young people while they're there?
316.101	Why not try to give them some type
316.101	of insight to make a change,
320.322	so once they reenter back into society,
323.783	they're doing something positive?
328.217	A second big thing to help our teens
328.217	in jails is better programming.
333.626	When I was on Rikers Island,
333.626	the huge thing was solitary confinement.
337.644	Solitary confinement
337.644	was originally designed
340.373	to break a person mentally,
340.373	physically and emotionally.
344.065	That's what it was designed for.
347.756	The U.S. Attorney General
347.756	recently released a report
350.224	stating that they're going
350.224	to ban solitary confinement
352.749	in New York state for teens.
355.698	One thing that kept me sane while I
355.698	was in solitary confinement was reading.
359.9	I tried to educate myself
359.9	as much as possible.
362.802	I read any and everything
362.802	I could get my hands on.
365.427	And aside from that,
365.427	I wrote music and short stories.
369.118	Some programs that I feel
369.118	would benefit our young people
374.194	are art therapy programs
377.245	for the kids that like to draw
377.245	and have that talent,
380.31	and what about the young individuals
380.31	that are musically inclined?
384.252	How about a music program for them
384.252	that actually teaches them
387.139	how to write and make music?
389.536	Just a thought.
390.96	When adolescents come to Rikers Island,
393.029	C74, RNDC is the building
393.029	that they're housed in.
397.143	"That's nicknamed ""gladiator school,"""
400.704	because you have a young individual
400.704	coming in from the street
403.586	thinking that they're tough,
405.363	being surrounded by a bunch
405.363	of other young individuals
408.683	from all of the five boroughs,
408.683	and everybody feels that they're tough.
412.327	So now you have a bunch of young gentlemen
412.327	poking their chests out
416.322	feeling that I have to prove
416.322	I'm equally as tough as you
419.712	or I'm tougher than you, you and you.
422.146	But let's be honest:
423.734	That culture is very dangerous
423.734	and damaging to our young people.
428.625	We need to help institutions
428.625	and these teens realize
431.579	that they don't have to lead
431.579	the previous lifestyle that they led
434.874	when they were on the street,
434.874	that they can actually make a change.
438.311	It's sad to report
438.311	that while I was in prison,
441.762	I used to hear dudes talking about
441.762	when they get released from prison,
445.991	what type of crimes
445.991	they're going to commit
449.079	when they get back in the street.
451.703	The conversations used to sound
451.703	something like this:
455.616	"""Oh, when I hit the street,"
455.616	my brother got this connection
458.443	"for this, that and the third,"""
459.891	"or, ""My man over here"
459.891	got this connection for the low price.
462.735	"Let's exchange information,"""
464.142	"and, ""When we hit the town,"
464.142	"we're going to do it real big."""
466.925	I used to hear these conversations
466.925	"and think to myself, ""Wow,"
469.784	these dudes are really talking about
469.784	going back in the street
472.716	"and committing future crimes."""
474.248	So I came up with a name for that:
475.99	I called it a go-back-to-jail-quick scheme
478.939	because really, how long
478.939	is that going to last?
482.523	You get a retirement plan with that?
484.883	Nice little pension? 401(k)? 403(b)?
488.341	You get health insurance? Dental?
491.639	(Laughter)
493.568	But I will tell you this:
495.424	Being in jail and being in prison,
497.166	I came across some of the most
497.166	intelligent, brilliant,
500.788	and talented people
500.788	that I would ever meet.
503.574	I've seen individuals
503.574	take a potato chip bag
505.803	and turn it into the most
505.803	beautiful picture frame.
508.434	I've seen individuals take
508.434	the state soap that's provided for free
511.546	and turn them into
511.546	the most beautiful sculptures
513.925	that would make Michelangelo
513.925	look like a kindergartner made it.
518.217	At the age of 21, I was in
518.217	a maximum-security prison
521.304	called Elmira Correctional Facility.
523.107	I just came out of the weight shack
523.107	from working out,
525.615	and I saw an older gentleman that I knew
525.615	standing in the middle of the yard
529.148	just looking up at the sky.
530.453	Mind you, this older gentlemen was serving
530.453	a 33-and-a-third-to-life sentence
534.649	in which he already had served
538.081	So I walk up to him and I said,
539.895	"""O.G., what's going on, man, you good?"""
541.857	He looked at me, and he said,
541.857	"""Yeah, I'm good, young blood."""
544.708	"I'm like, ""So what are you looking"
544.708	up at the sky for, man?
547.441	"What's so fascinating up there?"""
549.139	"He said, ""You look up"
549.139	"and you tell me what you see."""
553.087	"""Clouds."" (Laughter)"
556.615	"He said, ""All right."
556.615	"What else do you see?"""
559.522	At that time, it was a plane passing by.
562.023	"I said, ""All right, I see an airplane."""
564.05	"He said, ""Exactly, and what's "
564.05	"on that airplane?"" ""People."""
568.206	"""Exactly. Now where's that plane"
568.206	"and those people going?"""
572.083	"""I don't know. You know?"
573.569	Please let me know if you do.
573.569	"Then let me get some lottery numbers."""
578.236	"He said, ""You're missing"
578.236	the big picture, young blood.
581.394	That plane with those people
581.394	is going somewhere,
583.739	while we're here stuck.
586.317	The big picture is this:
588.151	That plane with those people
588.151	going somewhere,
590.519	that's life passing us by
590.519	"while we behind these walls, stuck."""
598.252	Ever since that day,
600.318	that sparked something in my mind
600.318	and made me know I had to make a change.
604.497	Growing up, I was always
604.497	a good, smart kid.
607.794	Some people would say
607.794	I was a little too smart for my own good.
612.743	I had dreams of becoming
612.743	an architect or an archaeologist.
618.29	Currently, I'm working
618.29	at the Fortune Society,
620.473	which is a reentry program,
622.222	and I work with people as a case manager
622.222	that are at high risk for recidivism.
626.765	So I connect them
626.765	with the services that they need
629.171	once they're released from jail and prison
631.2	so they can make a positive transition
631.2	back into society.
634.326	If I was to see my 15-year-old self today,
637.121	I would sit down and talk to him
637.121	and try to educate him
640.092	and I would let him know,
640.092	"""Listen, this is me. I'm you."
644.037	This is us. We are one.
646.431	Everything that you're about to do,
646.431	I know what you're gonna do
649.473	before you do it because I already did it,
652.097	and I would encourage him
652.097	not to hang out with x, y and z people.
655.734	I would tell him not to be
655.734	in such-and-such place.
658.54	I would tell him,
658.54	keep your behind in school, man,
660.916	because that's where you need to be,
662.836	because that's what's going
662.836	to get you somewhere in life.
665.54	This is the message
665.54	that we should be sharing
667.703	with our young men and young women.
669.576	We shouldn't be treating them as adults
669.576	and putting them in cultures of violence
673.504	that are nearly impossible
673.504	for them to escape.
676.203	Thank you.
678.268	(Applause)
