15.26	Have you ever wondered
17.26	what is inside your dental plaque?
20.26	Probably not, but people like me do.
22.26	I'm an archeological geneticist
24.26	at the Center for Evolutionary Medicine
26.26	at the University of Zurich,
28.26	and I study the origins and evolution of human health and disease
31.26	by conducting genetic research
33.26	on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans.
36.26	And through this work, I hope to better understand
39.26	the evolutionary vulnerabilities of our bodies,
41.26	so that we can improve
44.26	and better manage our health in the future.
46.26	There are different ways to approach evolutionary medicine,
49.26	and one way is to extract human DNA
51.26	from ancient bones.
53.26	And from these extracts,
55.26	we can reconstruct the human genome at different points in time
58.26	and look for changes that might be related to adaptations,
61.26	risk factors and inherited diseases.
64.26	But this is only one half of the story.
67.26	The most important health challenges today
70.26	are not caused by simple mutations in our genome,
73.26	but rather result from a complex and dynamic interplay
76.26	between genetic variation,
78.26	diet, microbes and parasites
80.26	and our immune response.
82.26	All of these diseases
84.26	have a strong evolutionary component
86.26	that directly relates to the fact
88.26	that we live today in a very different environment
90.26	than the ones in which our bodies evolved.
93.26	And in order to understand these diseases,
95.26	we need to move past studies of the human genome alone
98.26	and towards a more holistic approach
100.26	to human health in the past.
102.26	But there are a lot of challenges for this.
104.26	And first of all, what do we even study?
107.26	Skeletons are ubiquitous; they're found all over the place.
110.26	But of course, all of the soft tissue has decomposed,
113.26	and the skeleton itself
115.26	has limited health information.
117.26	Mummies are a great source of information,
119.26	except that they're really geographically limited
122.26	and limited in time as well.
124.26	Coprolites are fossilized human feces,
127.26	and they're actually extremely interesting.
129.26	You can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease,
132.26	but they are very rare.
134.26	(Laughter)
137.26	So to address this problem,
139.26	I put together a team of international researchers
141.26	in Switzerland, Denmark and the U.K.
143.26	to study a very poorly studied, little known material
149.26	that's found on people everywhere.
151.26	It's a type of fossilized dental plaque
154.26	that is called officially dental calculus.
157.26	Many of you may know it by the term tartar.
159.26	It's what the dentist cleans off your teeth
161.26	every time that you go in for a visit.
163.26	And in a typical dentistry visit,
165.26	you may have about 15 to 30 milligrams removed.
168.26	But in ancient times before tooth brushing,
171.26	up to 600 milligrams might have built up on the teeth
174.26	over a lifetime.
176.26	And what's really important about dental calculus
179.26	is that it fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton,
182.26	it's abundant in quantity before the present day
185.26	and it's ubiquitous worldwide.
187.26	We find it in every population around the world at all time periods
190.26	going back tens of thousands of years.
192.26	And we even find it in neanderthals and animals.
195.26	And so previous studies
197.26	had only focused on microscopy.
199.26	They'd looked at dental calculus under a microscope,
201.26	and what they had found was things like pollen
204.26	and plant starches,
206.26	and they'd found muscle cells from animal meats
208.26	and bacteria.
210.26	And so what my team of researchers, what we wanted to do,
213.26	is say, can we apply
215.26	genetic and proteomic technology
217.26	to go after DNA and proteins,
219.26	and from this can we get better taxonomic resolution
222.26	to really understand what's going on?
224.26	And what we found
226.26	is that we can find many commensal and pathogenic bacteria
228.26	that inhabited the nasal passages and mouth.
231.26	We also have found immune proteins
234.26	related to infection and inflammation
237.26	and proteins and DNA related to diet.
240.26	But what was surprising to us, and also quite exciting,
243.26	is we also found bacteria
245.26	that normally inhabit upper respiratory systems.
247.26	So it gives us virtual access to the lungs,
250.26	which is where many important diseases reside.
253.26	And we also found bacteria
255.26	that normally inhabit the gut.
257.26	And so we can also now virtually gain access
260.26	to this even more distant organ system
262.26	that, from the skeleton alone,
264.26	has long decomposed.
266.26	And so by applying ancient DNA sequencing
268.26	and protein mass spectrometry technologies
270.26	to ancient dental calculus,
272.26	we can generate immense quantities of data
275.26	that then we can use to begin to reconstruct a detailed picture
278.26	of the dynamic interplay
280.26	between diet, infection and immunity
282.26	thousands of years ago.
284.26	So what started out as an idea,
286.26	is now being implemented
288.26	to churn out millions of sequences
290.26	that we can use to investigate
292.26	the long-term evolutionary history of human health and disease,
295.26	right down to the genetic code of individual pathogens.
298.26	And from this information
300.26	we can learn about how pathogens evolve
302.26	and also why they continue to make us sick.
305.26	And I hope I have convinced you
307.26	of the value of dental calculus.
309.26	And as a final parting thought,
311.26	on behalf of future archeologists,
314.26	I would like to ask you to please think twice
317.26	before you go home and brush your teeth.
319.26	(Applause)
321.26	Thank you.
323.26	(Applause)
