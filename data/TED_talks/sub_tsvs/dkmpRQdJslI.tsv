12.689	Are you tired of your boss?
14.893	(Laughter)
16.273	Are you tired of going to work
18.138	and making money for other people?
21.785	And who are those people anyways?
23.385	Those people that make
23.385	money from your work.
26.198	Well, they're capitalists.
28.12	They have capital,
29.42	and they use your labor
29.42	to make more capital.
32.793	So if you're tired of going to work
34.891	and making money for other people,
37.12	then you're probably like me --
38.812	just tired of capitalism.
41.621	Which is ironic, because I'm a capitalist.
44.667	(Laughter)
46.109	I own a small business --
47.856	Rco Tires in Compton.
50.404	A few years ago, when I read Van Jones,
52.391	"and he wrote, ""Let's make"
52.391	"green collar jobs in the hood,"""
55.333	I took him really seriously.
57.908	So I cofounded, own and operate
57.908	a tire recycling company,
61.632	and I'm really proud of what we've done.
63.618	So far, we've recycled
63.618	a hundred million pounds of rubber.
67.402	That's 21 million gallons of oil
67.402	diverted from landfills
71.451	into new products.
73.055	(Cheers)
74.229	We also employ about 15 guys --
76.468	mostly people of color,
78.041	most of whom are felons,
79.435	and we pay above the minimum wage,
81.334	and we are now proud members
81.334	of the United Steelworkers Union.
84.768	(Applause)
90.351	Now, Rco is not a cooperative now.
92.914	It's a privately held company
92.914	with community-minded ownership,
96.605	but I would like it to become one.
98.383	I would like for them to fire the boss --
100.702	that's me.
102.065	(Laughter)
103.137	And I'm going to tell you why,
104.607	but first, let me tell you
104.607	how we got started.
107.683	So a lot of people ask,
108.857	"""How did Rco come to be?"""
110.315	And I have to be really honest.
112.239	I leveraged my white privilege.
114.584	So, here's how white privilege
114.584	worked for me and Rco.
119.268	My white grandmother
119.268	was born on her family's plantation
123.137	in Arkansas in 1918.
125.815	She traveled with her white father west,
128.769	following the oil boom.
130.362	And he held various union oil jobs --
133.566	jobs which would have never been given
133.566	to my black great-grandfather,
137.051	had he lived here at the time.
139.562	Granny became a hairdresser
141.515	and then got a loan with her husband
145.444	who built their home
145.444	in West Los Angeles --
147.538	a loan which would never have been
147.538	given to a black family at the time.
152.241	And after my grandfather passed away,
154.101	my granny was able to keep that house
155.904	because she had his pension
155.904	and his health care
158.605	from a state job which he held,
160.397	which again, would have never been
160.397	given to a black man
163.043	before the anti-discrimination
163.043	act of the 1960s.
165.868	So, you fast-forward 30 years,
167.75	and I graduate,
169.162	and I want to start my own business
170.888	with a pile of debt and a credit card,
172.789	and no experience in the tire industry.
175.156	But I had what most people didn't have.
177.417	I had a clean, safe, free place to live.
182.856	I moved in with my grandmother,
184.628	and I was able to rent
184.628	our first warehouse,
186.977	buy our first truck,
188.177	pay our first employees,
189.761	because I didn't have to worry
189.761	about paying myself,
192.199	because I didn't need to feed myself,
194.006	because I am the direct beneficiary
194.006	of generations of white privilege.
198.523	Now, telling the story
198.523	of white privilege is important
202.611	because very often people say,
204.064	"""Oh, we want more companies like yours."
205.946	We want more Rco's,
207.128	we want more black-owned businesses,
209.001	female-led, triple bottom line,
211.689	Ban the Box,
212.885	"green manufacturing companies,"" right?"
215.559	But the question we have to ask is,
215.559	where is the wealth?
218.226	Where is the money?
219.401	Where's the capital in our communities
221.291	to build the types
221.291	of businesses that we want?
223.474	And in telling a story
223.474	of the white side of my family,
226.046	I needed a dozen ways
227.221	where blacks were excluded
227.221	from the economy,
229.306	whereas the white side of my family
229.306	was able to gain access and traction,
232.878	and build wealth ...
235.044	Primarily because racism
235.044	and capitalism are best homies, but --
239.678	(Laughter)
241.504	but what that means
241.504	is that when we ask ourselves,
243.981	"""Why are our communities broke?"" --"
246.466	Like, we're not just broke
246.466	because we're broke;
248.696	we're broke for a reason.
250.055	Historical context really does matter.
253.53	But our history
253.53	tells another story as well.
255.705	There's this incredible book
255.705	"called ""Collective Courage,"""
258.417	which is the story of how
258.417	thousands of African Americans
261.657	have been able to build
261.657	businesses and schools,
264.201	hospitals, farming cooperatives,
266.468	banks, financial institutions --
268.209	entire communities
268.209	and sovereign economies,
270.845	without a lot of capital.
272.857	And they did it by working together
274.798	and leveraging their community assets
277.229	and trusting each other
278.705	and putting solidarity first --
280.429	not just profits by any means necessary.
284.201	And they didn't have to wait around
284.201	for celebrities and athletes
287.537	to bring their money back to the hood.
289.847	However, if you are
289.847	a celebrity or an athlete,
292.026	and you're listening to this,
293.443	please feel free to bring your money.
295.253	(Laughter)
297.851	But they did it
297.851	through cooperative economics,
300.111	because they knew
301.286	that capitalism was never
301.286	going to finance black liberation.
304.763	So, there are so many great
304.763	examples in this book,
308.814	and I suggest that everybody just read it
310.937	because it answers
310.937	the question I asked earlier,
313.204	which was where are we going
313.204	to get the wealth
315.532	to build the types
315.532	of business that we want.
317.632	And the answer is going to have
317.632	to be cooperative economics.
320.504	There's a lot of different
320.504	versions of cooperativism.
323.488	What I'm talking about today
323.488	is worker ownership.
326.504	You may not have heard
326.504	of worker ownership,
328.537	but it's been an incredible tool
330.171	for black economic liberation
330.171	for a century,
332.276	and it's also working
332.276	all over the world right now.
335.348	You may have heard of Black Wall Street
337.29	or maybe the Zapatistas,
338.505	but I'll give you an example
338.505	that's a little bit closer to home.
341.575	Right now, today, in South Bronx,
344.116	is the country's largest
344.116	worker-owned company.
347.337	It's called Cooperative
347.337	Home Care Associates,
350.03	and it was founded by black
350.03	and Latinx home care workers
353.014	who are now able
353.014	to pay themselves living wages,
356.111	they have full-time hours,
357.39	they have benefits and a pension,
359.042	through their membership
359.042	as a unit of SEIU.
362.598	And these women owners now receive
362.598	a dividend back on their ownership
366.47	every year that the company
366.47	has been profitable,
368.787	which has been most years.
370.809	So they're able to really enjoy
370.809	the fruits of their labor
374.754	because they fired the boss.
377.119	They don't have any big investors.
378.812	They don't have fat-cat CEOs
380.444	or absentee owners taking
380.444	the profit out of the company.
383.957	They each pay in
383.957	about 1,000 dollars over time
387.874	in order to gain ownership,
389.814	and now they own their job.
392.418	Now, there's hundreds of more examples
392.418	of companies like this
395.427	springing up all across the country.
397.285	And I'm so inspired by what they're doing,
400.558	because it really represents
400.558	an alternative
403.067	to the type of economy we have now,
405.122	which exploits all of us.
407.139	It also represents an alternative
408.814	to waiting around for big investors
408.814	to bring chain stores,
412.798	or big-box stores to our communities,
414.594	because honestly,
414.594	those types of developments,
416.894	they steal resources from our communities.
419.242	They put our mom-and-pop shops
419.242	out of business,
422.103	they make our entrepreneurs
422.103	into wage workers,
425.223	and they take money out of our pocket
427.053	and send it to their shareholders.
429.851	So, I was so inspired by all these stories
429.851	of resistance and resilience
433.275	that I got together with a few people
433.275	here in Los Angeles,
436.067	and we created LUCI.
437.815	LUCI stands for the Los Angeles
437.815	Union Cooperative Initiative,
442.014	and our objective is to create
442.014	more worker-owned businesses
445.134	here in Los Angeles.
446.824	So far, in the last year,
446.824	we've created two:
449.206	Pacific Electric, an electrical company,
451.223	and Vermont Gage Carwash,
452.802	which is right here in South-Central,
454.589	some of you guys
454.589	might be familiar with it.
456.645	This long-time carwash is now owned
456.645	and operated by its 20 workers,
461.34	all of whom are union members as well.
463.388	(Applause)
468.648	So you might be wondering
468.648	why the focus on union-worker ownership,
472.57	but there's a lot of good reasons
474.221	why the labor movement is a natural ally
474.221	to the worker-ownership movement.
477.995	To build these companies
477.995	that we want in our community,
480.615	we need a few things.
481.79	We're going to need money,
481.79	people and training.
484.82	Unions have all of those things.
487.7	America's working class has been
487.7	paying union dues for decades,
490.691	and with it, our unions have been building
492.763	dignified, decent,
492.763	and democratic workplaces for us.
495.621	However, union jobs
495.621	are on the steep decline,
498.07	and it's time for us to start
498.07	calling on our unions
500.5	to really bring all of their financial
500.5	and political capital
504.189	to bear in the creation of new,
504.189	union, living-wage jobs
507.896	in our communities.
509.693	Also, union halls
509.693	are full of union members
512.948	who understand
512.948	the importance of solidarity
516.115	and the power of collective action.
519.148	These are the types of folks that want
519.148	more union businesses to exist,
523.601	so let's build them with them.
527.067	Learning from our unions,
528.354	learning from our past,
529.529	learning from our peers,
530.726	are all going to be very
530.726	important to our success,
533.394	which is why I'd like to leave you
533.394	with one last example
536.322	and a vision for the future ...
538.973	and that vision is Mondragon, Spain.
542.305	Mondragon, Spain is a community
542.305	built entirely around worker cooperatives.
547.521	There's 260-plus businesses here,
550.506	manufacturing everything from bicycles
550.506	to washing machines to transformers.
555.866	And this group of businesses
555.866	now employs 80,000 people
559.406	and earns more than 12 billion euros
559.406	in revenue every year.
563.241	And all of the companies there
563.241	are owned by the people that work in them.
567.716	They've also built universities
567.716	and hospitals and financial institutions.
572.456	I mean, imagine if we could build
572.456	something like this in South-Central.
577.659	The late mayor of Jackson
577.659	had a similar idea.
581.385	He wanted to turn his entire city
581.385	into a Mondragon-like cooperative economy,
586.837	calling his ambitious plan
586.837	"""Jackson Rising."""
590.76	And when I look at Mondragon,
592.21	I see really what working-class people
592.21	can do for ourselves
595.044	when we work together
596.219	and make decisions
596.219	for ourselves and each other
598.799	and our communities.
603.336	And what's really incredible
603.336	about Mondragon
606.339	is that while we are dreaming about them,
608.83	they are dreaming about us.
611.285	This community in Spain has decided
611.285	to launch an international initiative
616.169	to create more communities
616.169	like it all over the world,
619.195	by linking up with unions,
620.826	by supporting organizations like LUCI,
622.763	and by educating folks
622.763	about the worker-ownership model.
627.177	Now, here's what you can do
627.177	to be a part of it.
629.716	If you're a union member,
629.716	go to your union meetings,
632.32	and make sure that your union
632.32	has a worker-ownership initiative,
635.534	and become a part of it.
637.177	If you're an entrepreneur,
638.475	if you have a small business,
639.919	or you're interested in starting one,
641.762	then link up with LUCI
641.762	or another organization like us
644.453	to help you get started
644.453	on the cooperative model.
647.078	If you're a politician,
648.254	or you work for one,
649.67	or you just like talking to them,
651.361	please get the city, state, federal
651.361	and county legislation passed
655.622	that we need in order to fund
655.622	and support worker-owned businesses.
659.807	And for everybody else,
661.064	learn about our history,
661.064	learn about our models,
663.327	and seek us out so can support us,
664.977	you can buy from us, invest in us,
664.977	lend to us and join us,
668.208	because it's really
668.208	going to take all of us
670.298	in order to build the more just
670.298	and sustainable and resilient economy
673.942	that we want for ourselves
673.942	and our children.
677.679	And with that,
678.932	I would like to leave you
678.932	with a quote from Arundhati Roy,
682.147	and she writes ...
684.367	"""Our strategy should not be only"
684.367	to confront Empire,
688.542	but to lay siege to it.
691.016	To deprive it of oxygen.
693.549	To mock it.
694.939	To shame it.
696.701	With our art,
697.94	our literature,
699.138	our music,
700.426	our brilliance,
702.131	our joy,
703.973	our sheer relentlessness --
706.394	and our ability to tell our own stories.
709.026	Not the stories that we're being
709.026	brainwashed to believe.
713.549	The corporate revolution will collapse
715.642	if we refuse to buy
715.642	what they're selling --
719.056	their ideas,
720.539	their version of history,
722.171	their wars,
723.346	their weapons,
725.144	their sense of inevitability.
727.776	Because know this:
729.624	They be few and we be many.
732.053	They need us more than we need them.
734.956	Another world is not only possible,
737.542	she's on her way.
739.477	And on a quiet day,
741.272	"I can hear her breathing."""
743.148	Thank you.
744.323	(Applause)
