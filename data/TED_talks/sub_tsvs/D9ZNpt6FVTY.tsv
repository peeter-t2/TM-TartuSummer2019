20.058	Heroes rarely look like me.
22.429	In fact,
23.878	I'm what garbage looks like.
26.162	No, not the most appealing
26.162	way to open a talk
28.99	or start a conversation,
30.711	and perhaps you have some questions
30.711	going through your head about that.
34.208	Why would this man say
34.208	such a thing about himself?
36.606	What does he mean?
38.103	How can someone view him as a hero
38.103	when he sees himself as garbage?
43.073	I believe we learn more from questions
43.073	than we do from answers.
46.18	Because when we're questioning something,
48.487	we're invested in taking in
48.487	some sort of new information,
51.845	or grappling with some sort of ignorance
51.845	that makes us feel uncomfortable.
56.106	And that's why I'm here:
57.836	to push us to question,
59.395	even when it makes us uncomfortable.
62.089	My parents are from Trinidad and Tobago,
65.056	the southernmost island in the Caribbean.
67.293	Trinidad is also home
67.293	to the only acoustic instrument
70.295	invented in the 20th century:
72.189	the steel pan.
74.138	Deriving from the African drums
76.555	and evolving from the genius
76.555	of one of the ghettos in Trinidad,
79.856	a city called Laventille,
81.566	and the disregard
81.566	of the American military ...
85.357	Well, I should tell you,
86.677	America, during WWII, had
86.677	military bases set up in Trinidad,
90.068	and when the war ended,
91.513	they left the island littered
91.513	with empty oil drums --
95.073	their trash.
96.767	So people from Laventille
96.767	repurposed the old drums left behind
101.075	into the full chromatic scale:
103.302	the steel pan.
104.907	Playing music now from Beethoven
104.907	to Bob Marley to 50 Cent,
109.315	those people literally made
109.315	music out of garbage.
114.574	Twelve days before my 20th birthday,
117.097	I was arrested for my role
117.097	in a violent robbery attempt
120.992	in lower Manhattan.
122.821	While people were sitting
122.821	in a coffee shop,
126.172	four people were shot.
129.192	Two were killed.
131.504	Five of us were arrested.
134.033	We were all the products
134.033	of Trinidad and Tobago.
136.695	"We were the ""bad immigrants,"""
138.628	"or the ""anchor babies"" that Trump"
138.628	and millions of Americans easily malign.
143.715	I was discarded, like waste material --
146.805	and justifiably so to many.
149.033	I eventually served 10 years, two months
149.033	and seven days of a prison sentence.
154.025	I was sentenced to a decade of punishment
154.025	in a correctional institution.
159.786	I was sentenced to irrelevance --
162.354	the opposite of humanity.
165.069	Interestingly,
166.654	it was during those years in prison
166.654	that a series of letters redeemed me,
171.701	helped me move beyond
171.701	the darkness and the guilt
174.564	associated with the worst
174.564	moment of my young life.
178.025	It gave me a sense that I was useful.
180.758	She was 13 years old.
183.156	She had wrote that she saw me as a hero.
186.318	I remember reading that,
187.73	and I remember crying
187.73	when I read those words.
191.234	She was one of over 50 students
193.702	and 150 letters that I wrote during
193.702	a mentoring correspondence program
197.776	that I co-designed with a friend
199.41	who was a teacher
199.41	at a middle school in Brooklyn,
201.764	my hometown.
202.944	We called it the Young Scholars Program.
205.693	Every time those young people
205.693	shared their stories with me,
209.439	their struggles,
211.07	every time they drew a picture
211.07	of their favorite cartoon character
214.867	and sent it to me,
216.326	every time they said they depended
216.326	on my letters or my words of advice,
220.72	it boosted my sense of worthiness.
223.661	It gave me a sense of what
223.661	I could contribute to this planet.
227.328	It transformed my life.
229.368	Because of those letters
229.368	and what they shared with me,
232.29	their stories of teen life,
234.179	they gave me the permission,
236.273	they gave me the courage
236.273	to admit to myself
238.713	that there were reasons -- not excuses --
241.54	but that there were reasons
241.54	for that fateful day in October of 1999;
246.617	that the trauma associated
246.617	with living in a community
249.283	where guns are easier
249.283	to get than sneakers;
252.612	that the trauma associated with being
252.612	raped at gunpoint at the age of 14;
259.427	that those are reasons for me
262.148	why making that decision,
263.962	that fatal decision,
265.151	was not an unlikely proposition.
268.012	Because those letters
268.012	mattered so much to me,
270.743	because writing and receiving
272.175	and having that communication
272.175	with those folks
274.456	so hugely impacted my life,
275.979	I decided to share the opportunity
275.979	with some friends of mine
278.885	who were also inside with me.
280.305	My friends Bill and Cory and Arocks,
282.286	all in prison for violent crimes also,
284.534	shared their words of wisdom
284.534	with the young people as well,
287.362	and received the sense
287.362	of relevancy in return.
290.142	We are now published writers
290.142	and youth program innovators
293.352	and trauma experts
295.125	and gun violence prevention advocates,
297.018	and TED talkers and --
298.42	(Laughter)
299.47	and good daddies.
300.948	That's what I call a positive
300.948	return of investment.
304.57	Above all else,
305.744	what building that program
305.744	taught me was that when we sow,
309.671	when we invest in the humanity
309.671	of people no matter where they're at,
313.457	we can reap amazing rewards.
316.811	In this latest era
316.811	of criminal justice reform,
319.17	I often question and wonder why --
322.812	why is it that so many believe
324.369	that only those who have been convicted
324.369	of nonviolent drug offenses
327.859	merit empathy and recognized humanity?
332.908	Criminal justice reform is human justice.
335.813	Am I not human?
338.7	When we invest in resources
338.7	that amplify the relevancy of people
343.202	in communities like Laventille
344.696	or parts of Brooklyn or a ghetto near you,
346.869	we can literally create
346.869	the communities that we want.
350.044	We can do better.
351.447	We can do better than investing solely
351.447	in law enforcement as a resource,
355.059	because they don't give us
355.059	a sense of relevancy
357.98	that is at the core of why so many of us
357.98	do so many harmful things
361.554	in the pursuit of mattering.
365.176	See, gun violence is just a visible
365.176	display of a lot of underlying traumas.
370.263	When we invest in the redemptive
370.263	value of relevancy,
373.319	we can render a return of both
373.319	personal responsibility and healing.
378.124	That's the people work I care about,
380.392	because people work.
383.133	Family, I'm asking you
383.133	to do the hard work,
387.085	the difficult work,
388.557	the churning work of bestowing
388.557	undeserved kindness
391.516	upon those who we can relegate as garbage,
393.987	who we can disregard and discard easily.
396.843	I'm asking myself.
399.33	Over the past two months,
401.274	I've lost two friends to gun violence,
403.961	both innocent bystanders.
406.748	One was caught in a drive-by
406.748	while walking home.
410.92	The other was sitting in a caf√©
410.92	while eating breakfast,
414.057	while on vacation in Miami.
417.595	I'm asking myself to see
417.595	the redemptive value of relevancy
420.937	in the people that murdered them,
423.519	because of the hard work
423.519	of seeing the value in me.
426.671	I'm pushing us to challenge
426.671	our own capacity
430.829	to fully experience our humanity,
433.218	by understanding the full biography
435.231	of people who we can
435.231	easily choose not to see,
439.728	because heroes are waiting
439.728	to be recognized,
442.969	and music is waiting to be made.
445.656	Thank you.
446.948	(Applause)
