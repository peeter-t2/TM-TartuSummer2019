13.689	It's 1878.
16.789	Sir Francis Galton
16.789	gives a remarkable talk.
21.138	He's speaking to the anthropologic
21.138	institute of Great Britain and Ireland.
25.99	Known for his pioneering work
25.99	in human intelligence,
30.04	Galton is a brilliant polymath.
33.536	He's an explorer,
35.114	an anthropologist,
36.891	a sociologist,
38.445	a psychologist
40.038	and a statistician.
43.207	He's also a eugenist.
46.42	In this talk,
48.627	he presents a new technique
48.627	by which he can combine photographs
53.404	and produce composite portraits.
56.483	This technique could be used
56.483	to characterize different types of people.
62.522	Galton thinks that if he combines
62.522	photographs of violent criminals,
67.895	he will discover the face of criminality.
72.073	But to his surprise,
74.084	the composite portrait that he produces
77.771	is beautiful.
81.846	Galton's surprising finding
81.846	raises deep questions:
85.335	What is beauty?
87.89	Why do certain configurations of line
87.89	and color and form excite us so?
96.192	For most of human history,
97.744	these questions have been approached
97.744	using logic and speculation.
103.935	But in the last few decades,
105.476	scientists have addressed
105.476	the question of beauty
108.378	using ideas from evolutionary psychology
108.378	and tools of neuroscience.
114.322	We're beginning to glimpse
114.322	the why and the how of beauty,
118.765	at least in terms of what it means
118.765	for the human face and form.
123.021	And in the process,
124.601	we're stumbling upon some surprises.
127.98	When it comes to seeing
127.98	beauty in each other,
131.569	while this decision is certainly
131.569	subjective for the individual,
135.948	it's sculpted by factors that contribute
135.948	to the survival of the group.
140.63	Many experiments have shown
143.302	that a few basic parameters contribute
143.302	to what makes a face attractive.
148.135	These include averaging, symmetry
148.135	and the effects of hormones.
153.835	Let's take each one of these in turn.
158.351	Galton's finding
159.849	that composite or average faces
159.849	are typically more attractive
165.156	than each individual face
165.156	that contributes to the average
168.737	has been replicated many times.
171.753	This laboratory finding fits
171.753	with many people's intuitions.
176.574	Average faces represent
176.574	the central tendencies of a group.
181.544	People with mixed features
181.544	represent different populations,
185.887	and presumably harbor
185.887	greater genetic diversity
189.259	and adaptability to the environment.
192.157	Many people find mixed-race
192.157	individuals attractive
196.585	and inbred families less so.
200.447	The second factor that contributes
200.447	to beauty is symmetry.
205.294	People generally find symmetric faces
205.294	more attractive than asymmetric ones.
210.578	Developmental abnormalities
210.578	are often associated with asymmetries.
215.854	And in plants, animals and humans,
219.143	asymmetries often arise
219.143	from parasitic infections.
223.193	Symmetry, it turns out,
225.435	is also an indicator of health.
230.289	In the 1930s,
232.599	a man named Maksymilian Faktorowicz
235.523	recognized the importance
235.523	of symmetry for beauty
238.724	when he designed the beauty micrometer.
242.117	With this device,
243.292	he could measure minor asymmetric flaws
246.371	which he could then make up for
246.371	with products he sold from his company,
250.944	named brilliantly
250.944	after himself, Max Factor,
254.792	which, as you know,
254.792	is one of the world's most famous brands
257.827	"for ""make up."""
260.335	The third factor that contributes
260.335	to facial attractiveness
264.317	is the effect of hormones.
267.353	And here, I need to apologize
267.353	for confining my comments
272.102	to heterosexual norms.
275.438	But estrogen and testosterone
275.438	play important roles
279.932	in shaping features
279.932	that we find attractive.
283.463	Estrogen produces features
283.463	that signal fertility.
288.154	Men typically find women attractive
291.128	who have elements
291.128	of both youth and maturity.
296.003	A face that's too baby-like might
296.003	mean that the girl is not yet fertile,
300.939	so men find women attractive
302.936	who have large eyes,
302.936	full lips and narrow chins
307.196	as indicators of youth,
309.52	and high cheekbones
309.52	as an indicator of maturity.
314.384	Testosterone produces features
314.384	that we regard as typically masculine.
320.597	These include heavier brows,
322.641	thinner cheeks
323.97	and bigger, squared-off jaws.
326.246	But here's a fascinating irony.
329.515	In many species,
330.69	if anything,
332.095	testosterone suppresses the immune system.
336.822	So the idea that testosterone-infused
336.822	features are a fitness indicator
341.02	doesn't really make a whole lot of sense.
344.003	Here, the logic is turned on its head.
347.478	Instead of a fitness indicator,
349.651	scientists invoke a handicap principle.
354.609	The most commonly cited
354.609	example of a handicap
358.165	is the peacock's tail.
360.362	This beautiful but cumbersome tail
360.362	doesn't exactly help the peacock
364.782	avoid predators
366.73	and approach peahens.
369.008	Why should such an extravagant
369.008	appendage evolve?
373.767	Even Charles Darwin,
376.228	in an 1860 letter to Asa Gray wrote
379.651	that the sight of the peacock's tail
379.651	made him physically ill.
383.964	He couldn't explain it
383.964	with his theory of natural selection,
386.886	and out of this frustration,
388.809	he developed the theory
388.809	of sexual selection.
393.321	On this account,
394.495	the display of the peacock's tail
394.495	is about sexual enticement,
398.902	and this enticement means
398.902	it's more likely the peacock will mate
405.148	and have offspring.
407.638	Now, the modern twist
407.638	on this display argument
411.292	is that the peacock is also
411.292	advertising its health to the peahen.
417.821	Only especially fit organisms
417.821	can afford to divert resources
422.972	to maintaining such
422.972	an extravagant appendage.
426.412	Only especially fit men can afford
426.412	the price that testosterone levies
431.329	on their immune system.
433.38	And by analogy, think of the fact
436.062	that only very rich men can afford
436.062	to pay more than $10,000 for a watch
443.051	as a display of their financial fitness.
446.933	Now, many people hear these kinds
446.933	of evolutionary claims
449.759	and think they mean that we somehow
449.759	are unconsciously seeking mates
455.513	who are healthy.
457.452	And I think this idea
457.452	is probably not right.
462.089	Teenagers and young adults are not exactly
462.089	known for making decisions
466.975	that are predicated on health concerns.
470.364	But they don't have to be,
471.989	and let me explain why.
474.971	Imagine a population
477.028	in which people have three different
477.028	kinds of preferences:
481.23	for green, for orange and for red.
485.742	From their point of view,
486.957	these preferences have
486.957	nothing to do with health;
489.344	they just like what they like.
491.948	But if it were also the case
491.948	that these preferences are associated
496.013	with the different likelihood
496.013	of producing offspring --
499.035	let's say in a ratio of 3:2:1 --
502.88	then in the first generation,
504.348	there would be 3 greens
504.348	to 2 oranges to 1 red,
507.644	and in each subsequent generation,
509.854	the proportion of greens increase,
513.887	so that in 10 generations,
	has a green preference.
519.783	Now, a scientist coming in
519.783	and sampling this population
522.928	discovers that green
522.928	preferences are universal.
527.426	So the point about this little
527.426	abstract example
531.322	is that while preferences
531.322	for specific physical features
536.006	can be arbitrary for the individual,
539.91	if those features are heritable
545.052	and they are associated
545.052	with a reproductive advantage,
549.235	over time,
550.473	they become universal for the group.
554.992	So what happens in the brain
554.992	when we see beautiful people?
562.34	Attractive faces activate
562.34	parts of our visual cortex
566.392	in the back of the brain,
568.361	an area called the fusiform gyrus,
570.327	that is especially tuned
570.327	to processing faces,
573.153	and an adjacent area called
573.153	the lateral occipital complex,
577.191	that is especially attuned
577.191	to processing objects.
580.52	In addition,
581.94	attractive faces activate parts
581.94	of our reward and pleasure centers
587.042	in the front and deep in the brain,
589.999	and these include areas
589.999	that have complicated names,
593.147	like the ventral striatum,
595.035	the orbitofrontal cortex
596.978	and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.
600.552	Our visual brain that is tuned
600.552	to processing faces
604.56	interacts with our pleasure centers
607.221	to underpin the experience of beauty.
611.539	Amazingly, while we all
611.539	engage with beauty,
615.655	without our knowledge,
617.276	beauty also engages us.
620.298	Our brains respond to attractive faces
622.821	even when we're not thinking about beauty.
626.457	We conducted an experiment
626.457	in which people saw a series of faces,
630.77	and in one condition,
632.497	they had to decide if a pair of faces
632.497	were the same or a different person.
639.727	Even in this condition,
642.244	attractive faces drove neural activity
642.244	robustly in their visual cortex,
648.41	despite the fact that they were thinking
648.41	about a person's identity
651.947	and not their beauty.
654.947	Another group similarly found
654.947	automatic responses to beauty
659.282	within our pleasure centers.
662.371	Taken together, these studies suggest
665.853	that our brain automatically
665.853	responds to beauty
670.388	by linking vision and pleasure.
673.674	These beauty detectors, it seems,
676.078	ping every time we see beauty,
677.94	regardless of whatever else
677.94	we might be thinking.
682.842	"We also have a ""beauty is good"""
682.842	stereotype embedded in the brain.
689.532	Within the orbitofrontal cortex,
691.783	there's overlapping neural activity
693.582	in response to beauty and to goodness,
699.005	and this happens even when people
699.005	aren't explicitly thinking
702.551	about beauty or goodness.
705.726	Our brains seem to reflexively
705.726	associate beauty and good.
710.51	And this reflexive association
710.51	may be the biologic trigger
714.512	for the many social effects of beauty.
717.877	Attractive people receive
717.877	all kinds of advantages in life.
723.376	They're regarded as more intelligent,
726.154	more trustworthy,
727.781	they're given higher pay
727.781	and lesser punishments,
731.35	even when such judgments
731.35	are not warranted.
735.392	These kinds of observations
735.392	reveal beauty's ugly side.
739.616	In my lab, we recently found
741.713	that people with minor facial
741.713	anomalies and disfigurements
746.659	are regarded as less good, less kind,
750.467	less intelligent, less competent
750.467	and less hardworking.
755.674	Unfortunately, we also have
755.674	"a ""disfigured is bad"" stereotype."
762.218	This stereotype is probably
762.218	exploited and magnified
768.9	by images in popular media,
771.337	in which facial disfigurement
771.337	is often used as a shorthand
775.257	to depict someone of villainous character.
779.198	We need to understand
779.198	these kinds of implicit biases
782.676	if we are to overcome them
784.437	and aim for a society
784.437	in which we treat people fairly,
788.142	based on their behavior and not
788.142	on the happenstance of their looks.
796.578	Let me leave you with one final thought.
800.864	Beauty is a work in progress.
804.347	The so-called universal
804.347	attributes of beauty
807.578	were selected for during the almost
807.578	two million years of the Pleistocene.
813.764	Life was nasty, brutish
813.764	and a very long time ago.
819.834	The selection criteria
819.834	for reproductive success from that time
825.182	doesn't really apply today.
827.786	For example,
829.3	death by parasite is not one
829.3	of the top ways that people die,
833.391	at least not in the technologically
833.391	developed world.
837.817	From antibiotics to surgery,
840.201	birth control to in vitro fertilization,
843.717	the filters for reproductive success
843.717	are being relaxed.
847.776	And under these relaxed conditions,
850.455	preference and trait combinations
850.455	are free to drift
854.713	and become more variable.
857.236	Even as we are profoundly
857.236	affecting our environment,
862.805	modern medicine
862.805	and technological innovation
866.142	is profoundly affecting
867.919	the very essence of what it means
867.919	to look beautiful.
873.017	The universal nature of beauty is changing
875.591	even as we're changing the universe.
880.683	Thank you.
881.892	(Applause)
