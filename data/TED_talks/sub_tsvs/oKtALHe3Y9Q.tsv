12.739	So it's 2006.
14.769	My friend Harold Ford calls me.
16.899	He's running for U.S. Senate in Tennessee,
20.564	"and he says, ""Mellody, I desperately need some national press. Do you have any ideas?"""
25.151	So I had an idea. I called a friend
27.13	who was in New York
28.282	at one of the most successful
28.282	media companies in the world,
31.671	"and she said, ""Why don't we host"
33.757	an editorial board lunch for Harold?
36.003	"You come with him."""
37.598	Harold and I arrive in New York.
39.343	We are in our best suits.
41.358	We look like shiny new pennies.
43.573	And we get to the receptionist, and we say,
46.094	"""We're here for the lunch."""
47.474	She motions for us to follow her.
49.678	We walk through a series of corridors,
52.12	and all of a sudden we find ourselves
53.374	in a stark room,
55.04	at which point she looks at us and she says,
58.13	"""Where are your uniforms?"""
62.415	Just as this happens,
63.661	my friend rushes in.
65.99	The blood drains from her face.
68.438	There are literally no words, right?
70.82	And I look at her, and I say,
71.839	"""Now, don't you think we need"
73.729	"more than one black person in the U.S. Senate?"""
77.8	Now Harold and I --
79.828	(Applause) â€”
82.346	we still laugh about that story,
85.435	and in many ways, the moment caught me off guard,
88.871	but deep, deep down inside,
91.891	I actually wasn't surprised.
94.015	And I wasn't surprised because of something
95.438	my mother taught me about 30 years before.
98.574	You see, my mother was ruthlessly realistic.
101.989	I remember one day coming
101.989	home from a birthday party
103.981	where I was the only black kid invited,
105.82	and instead of asking me the
105.82	normal motherly questions
108.497	"like, ""Did you have fun?"" or ""How was the cake?"""
111.481	my mother looked at me and she said,
113.658	"""How did they treat you?"""
115.89	I was seven. I did not understand.
118.657	I mean, why would anyone treat me differently?
121.94	But she knew.
123.065	And she looked me right in the eye and she said,
125.737	"""They will not always treat you well."""
128.912	Now, race is one of those topics in America
131.258	that makes people extraordinarily uncomfortable.
134.736	You bring it up at a dinner party
136.39	or in a workplace environment,
138.035	it is literally the conversational equivalent
141.215	of touching the third rail.
143.09	There is shock,
144.265	followed by a long silence.
147.23	And even coming here today,
148.884	I told some friends and colleagues
150.035	that I planned to talk about race,
151.601	and they warned me, they told me, don't do it,
154.26	that there'd be huge risks
156.147	in me talking about this topic,
157.677	that people might think I'm a militant black woman
160.168	and I would ruin my career.
162.352	And I have to tell you,
163.643	I actually for a moment was a bit afraid.
166.1	Then I realized,
168.17	the first step to solving any problem
170.649	is to not hide from it,
172.44	and the first step to any form of action
176.422	is awareness.
178.477	And so I decided to actually talk about race.
181.917	And I decided that if I came
181.917	here and shared with you
184.79	some of my experiences,
186.974	that maybe we could all be a little less anxious
189.662	and a little more bold
191.208	in our conversations about race.
194.11	Now I know there are people out there who will say
196.1	that the election of Barack Obama meant
197.726	that it was the end of racial discrimination
200.525	for all eternity, right?
202.547	But I work in the investment business,
204.19	and we have a saying:
205.65	The numbers do not lie.
207.705	And here, there are significant,
210.319	quantifiable racial disparities
213.04	that cannot be ignored,
214.559	in household wealth, household income,
218.142	job opportunities, healthcare.
221.141	One example from corporate America:
223.628	Even though white men
225.633	make up just 30 percent of the U.S. population,
229.424	they hold 70 percent of all corporate board seats.
233.823	Of the Fortune 250,
236.101	there are only seven CEOs that are minorities,
239.944	and of the thousands of publicly
239.944	traded companies today, thousands,
244.21	only two are chaired by black women,
247.036	and you're looking at one of them,
248.841	the same one who, not too long ago,
250.993	was nearly mistaken for kitchen help.
253.85	So that is a fact.
255.024	Now I have this thought experiment
257.212	that I play with myself, when I say,
259.739	imagine if I walked you into a room
261.998	and it was of a major corporation, like ExxonMobil,
265.257	and every single person around
265.257	the boardroom were black,
268.867	you would think that were weird.
271.4	But if I walked you into a Fortune 500 company,
274.204	and everyone around the table is a white male,
276.327	when will it be that we think that's weird too?
279.426	And I know how we got here.
281.14	(Applause)
285.303	I know how we got here.
287.071	You know, there was institutionalized,
289.757	at one time legalized, discrimination in our country.
292.866	There's no question about it.
295.16	But still, as I grapple with this issue,
297.985	my mother's question hangs in the air for me:
300.51	How did they treat you?
302.593	Now, I do not raise this issue to complain
305.069	or in any way to elicit any kind of sympathy.
307.315	I have succeeded in my life
309.298	beyond my wildest expectations,
312.14	and I have been treated well by people of all races
315.105	more often than I have not.
317.341	I tell the uniform story because it happened.
320.154	I cite those statistics around
320.154	corporate board diversity
322.774	because they are real,
324.438	and I stand here today
326.102	talking about this issue of racial discrimination
328.692	because I believe it threatens to rob
331.187	another generation of all the opportunities
334.473	that all of us want for all of our children,
337.058	no matter what their color
338.821	or where they come from.
340.62	And I think it also threatens to hold back businesses.
344.198	You see, researchers have coined this term
346.999	"""color blindness"""
348.834	to describe a learned behavior where we pretend
351.509	that we don't notice race.
353.354	If you happen to be surrounded by a bunch of people
355.514	who look like you, that's purely accidental.
359.29	Now, color blindness, in my view,
361.39	doesn't mean that there's no racial discrimination,
364.248	and there's fairness.
365.943	It doesn't mean that at all. It doesn't ensure it.
368.09	In my view, color blindness is very dangerous
370.488	because it means we're ignoring the problem.
373.245	There was a corporate study that said that,
375.775	instead of avoiding race,
377.552	the really smart corporations
377.552	actually deal with it head on.
381.524	They actually recognize that embracing diversity
384.308	means recognizing all races,
387.307	including the majority one.
389.669	But I'll be the first one to tell you,
391.465	this subject matter can be hard,
394.306	awkward, uncomfortable -- but that's kind of the point.
398.358	In the spirit of debunking racial stereotypes,
401.38	the one that black people don't like to swim,
403.555	I'm going to tell you how much I love to swim.
406.785	I love to swim so much
409.072	that as an adult, I swim with a coach.
411.204	And one day my coach had me do a drill
414.041	where I had to swim to one end of a 25-meter pool
416.652	without taking a breath.
418.54	And every single time I failed,
420.681	I had to start over.
422.018	And I failed a lot.
423.531	By the end, I got it, but when I got out of the pool,
425.398	I was exasperated and tired and annoyed,
428.021	"and I said, ""Why are we doing"
428.021	"breath-holding exercises?"""
431.959	And my coach looked me
431.959	"at me, and he said, ""Mellody,"
434.125	that was not a breath-holding exercise.
437.116	That drill was to make you comfortable
439.465	being uncomfortable,
441.258	"because that's how most of us spend our days."""
444.389	If we can learn to deal with our discomfort,
446.655	and just relax into it,
448.689	we'll have a better life.
450.913	So I think it's time for us to be comfortable
453.466	with the uncomfortable conversation about race:
456.712	black, white, Asian, Hispanic,
459.388	male, female, all of us,
461.661	if we truly believe in equal rights
463.937	and equal opportunity in America,
465.948	I think we have to have real conversations
468.951	about this issue.
470.203	We cannot afford to be color blind.
472.975	We have to be color brave.
476.222	We have to be willing, as teachers and parents
480.26	and entrepreneurs and scientists,
482.09	we have to be willing to have
483.373	proactive conversations about race
486.21	with honesty and understanding and courage,
489.349	not because it's the right thing to do,
492.888	but because it's the smart thing to do,
495.161	because our businesses and our products
497.544	and our science, our research,
499.598	all of that will be better with greater diversity.
503.235	Now, my favorite example of color bravery
506.19	is a guy named John Skipper.
507.648	He runs ESPN.
509.5	He's a North Carolina native,
511.83	quintessential Southern gentleman, white.
514.877	He joined ESPN, which already had a culture
517.288	of inclusion and diversity, but he took it up a notch.
520.061	He demanded that every open position
522.649	have a diverse slate of candidates.
525.599	Now he says the senior people
527.398	in the beginning bristled,
529.21	and they would come to him and say,
531.26	"""Do you want me to hire the minority,"
533.868	or do you want me to hire
533.868	"the best person for the job?"""
537.486	And Skipper says his answers were always the same:
541.145	"""Yes."""
542.82	And by saying yes to diversity,
544.63	I honestly believe that ESPN
546.992	is the most valuable cable franchise in the world.
549.482	I think that's a part of the secret sauce.
551.928	Now I can tell you, in my own industry,
553.97	at Ariel Investments, we actually view our diversity
556.145	as a competitive advantage,
558.305	and that advantage can extend
558.305	way beyond business.
561.626	There's a guy named Scott Page
561.626	at the University of Michigan.
563.81	He is the first person to develop
565.539	a mathematical calculation for diversity.
568.579	He says, if you're trying to
568.579	solve a really hard problem,
570.87	really hard,
572.031	that you should have a diverse group of people,
574.86	including those with diverse intellects.
577.87	The example that he gives is the smallpox epidemic.
580.723	When it was ravaging Europe,
583.648	they brought together all these scientists,
585.028	and they were stumped.
586.49	And the beginnings of the cure to the disease
589.582	came from the most unlikely source,
591.775	a dairy farmer who noticed that the milkmaids
596.155	were not getting smallpox.
598.064	And the smallpox vaccination is bovine-based
601.418	because of that dairy farmer.
603.82	Now I'm sure you're sitting here and you're saying,
606.232	I don't run a cable company,
608.327	I don't run an investment firm,
610.449	I am not a dairy farmer.
611.9	What can I do?
613.35	And I'm telling you, you can be color brave.
616.866	If you're part of a hiring process
618.75	or an admissions process,
620.39	you can be color brave.
622.057	If you are trying to solve a really hard problem,
624.901	you can speak up and be color brave.
627.68	Now I know people will say,
630.929	but that doesn't add up to a lot,
633.079	but I'm actually asking you
633.079	to do something really simple:
636.05	observe your environment,
638.268	at work, at school, at home.
642.08	I'm asking you to look at the people around you
644.429	purposefully and intentionally.
647.05	Invite people into your life
648.493	who don't look like you, don't think like you,
651.329	don't act like you,
652.624	don't come from where you come from,
654.585	and you might find that they
654.585	will challenge your assumptions
657.235	and make you grow as a person.
658.991	You might get powerful new insights
661.331	from these individuals,
662.954	or, like my husband, who happens to be white,
666.14	you might learn that black people,
668.21	men, women, children,
669.767	we use body lotion every single day.
672.656	Now, I also think that this is very important
677.278	so that the next generation really understands
680.25	that this progress will help them,
681.76	because they're expecting
681.76	us to be great role models.
684.894	Now, I told you, my mother,
686.371	she was ruthlessly realistic.
687.942	She was an unbelievable role model.
691.182	She was the kind of person
692.313	who got to be the way she was
693.635	because she was a single mom
695.611	with six kids in Chicago.
697.283	She was in the real estate business,
699.075	where she worked extraordinarily hard
701.825	but oftentimes had a hard time making ends meet.
705.093	And that meant sometimes we got
706.94	our phone disconnected,
708.32	or our lights turned off,
709.188	or we got evicted.
711.129	When we got evicted, sometimes we lived
712.67	in these small apartments that she owned,
714.476	sometimes in only one or two rooms,
716.075	because they weren't completed,
717.832	and we would heat our bathwater on hot plates.
722.543	But she never gave up hope, ever,
725.055	and she never allowed us to give up hope either.
727.735	This brutal pragmatism that she had,
729.312	I mean, I was four and she told me,
731.106	"""Mommy is Santa."" (Laughter)"
733.429	She was this brutal pragmatism.
735.912	She taught me so many lessons,
738.285	but the most important lesson
740.118	was that every single day she told me,
743.344	"""Mellody, you can be anything."""
748.68	And because of those words,
750.538	I would wake up at the crack of dawn,
752.643	and because of those words,
754.459	I would love school more than anything,
757.471	and because of those words, when I was on a bus
759.404	going to school, I dreamed the biggest dreams.
762.657	And it's because of those words
762.657	that I stand here right now
765.76	full of passion,
767.716	asking you to be brave for the kids
770.124	who are dreaming those dreams today.
772.434	(Applause)
777.855	You see, I want them to look at a CEO on television
782.044	"and say, ""I can be like her,"""
784.231	"or, ""He looks like me."""
786.738	And I want them to know
788.479	that anything is possible,
790.174	that they can achieve the highest level
791.69	that they ever imagined,
793.444	that they will be welcome
793.444	in any corporate boardroom,
796.539	or they can lead any company.
799.43	You see this idea of being the land
801.368	of the free and the home of the brave,
803.042	it's woven into the fabric of America.
806.49	America, when we have a challenge,
808.498	we take it head on, we don't shrink away from it.
811.374	We take a stand. We show courage.
814.233	So right now, what I'm asking you to do,
816.242	I'm asking you to show courage.
818.22	I'm asking you to be bold.
820.488	As business leaders, I'm asking you
822.309	not to leave anything on the table.
824.512	As citizens, I'm asking you
824.512	not to leave any child behind.
828.552	I'm asking you not to be color blind,
831.007	but to be color brave,
833.11	so that every child knows that their future matters
836.267	and their dreams are possible.
837.899	Thank you.
840.429	(Applause)
845.917	Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. (Applause)
