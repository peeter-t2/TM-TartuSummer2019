12.531	It was less than a year after September 11,
15.107	and I was at the Chicago Tribune
16.782	writing about shootings and murders,
18.656	and it was leaving me feeling
20.118	pretty dark and depressed.
21.9	I had done some activism in college,
23.482	so I decided to help a local group
25.129	hang door knockers against animal testing.
27.838	I thought it would be a safe way
29.345	to do something positive,
31.227	but of course I have the absolute worst luck ever,
33.793	and we were all arrested.
36.118	Police took this blurry photo of me
38.33	holding leaflets as evidence.
41.556	My charges were dismissed,
43.42	but a few weeks later,
44.556	two FBI agents knocked on my door,
46.593	and they told me that unless I helped them
48.354	by spying on protest groups,
50.455	they would put me on a domestic terrorist list.
54.272	I'd love to tell you that I didn't flinch,
56.308	but I was terrified,
58.299	and when my fear subsided,
60.183	I became obsessed with finding out
62.1	how this happened,
63.217	how animal rights and environmental activists
65.395	who have never injured anyone
67.609	could become the FBI's number one
69.522	domestic terrorism threat.
72.726	A few years later, I was invited to testify
74.696	before Congress about my reporting,
77.2	and I told lawmakers that, while everybody
78.558	is talking about going green,
80.283	some people are risking their lives
81.821	to defend forests and to stop oil pipelines.
85.333	They're physically putting their bodies on the line
87.382	between the whalers' harpoons and the whales.
90.807	These are everyday people,
92.496	like these protesters in Italy
94.582	who spontaneously climbed over
96.644	barbed wire fences to rescue beagles
98.945	from animal testing.
101.106	And these movements have been incredibly effective
103.782	and popular,
105.72	so in 1985, their opponents made up a new word,
109.581	eco-terrorist,
111.145	to shift how we view them.
113.269	They just made it up.
115.156	Now these companies have backed new laws
117.693	like the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act,
120.432	which turns activism into terrorism
122.551	if it causes a loss of profits.
125.319	Now most people never even heard about this law,
128.318	including members of Congress.
130.444	Less than one percent were in the room
132.355	when it passed the House.
134.815	The rest were outside at a new memorial.
137.718	They were praising Dr. King
139.379	as his style of activism was branded as terrorism
142.805	if done in the name of animals or the environment.
146.456	Supporters say laws like this are needed
148.393	for the extremists:
150.242	the vandals, the arsonists, the radicals.
153.191	But right now, companies like TransCanada
155.453	are briefing police in presentations like this one
158.778	about how to prosecute nonviolent protesters
161.467	as terrorists.
163.605	The FBI's training documents on eco-terrorism
167.228	are not about violence,
168.779	they're about public relations.
171.492	Today, in multiple countries,
173.465	corporations are pushing new laws
174.953	that make it illegal to photograph
176.667	animal cruelty on their farms.
179.927	The latest was in Idaho just two weeks ago,
182.454	and today we released a lawsuit
184.227	challenging it as unconstitutional
185.954	as a threat to journalism.
188.527	The first of these ag-gag prosecutions,
190.865	as they're called,
192.3	was a young woman named Amy Meyer,
193.952	and Amy saw a sick cow being moved
195.565	by a bulldozer outside of a slaughterhouse
198.114	as she was on the public street.
200.528	And Amy did what any of us would:
202.739	She filmed it.
204.514	When I found out about her story, I wrote about it,
207.563	and within 24 hours, it created such an uproar
210.488	that the prosecutors just dropped all the charges.
213.738	But apparently, even exposing stuff like that
215.756	is a threat.
217.576	Through the Freedom of Information Act,
219.24	I learned that the counter-terrorism unit
221.1	has been monitoring my articles
223.177	and speeches like this one.
225.463	They even included this nice
225.463	little write-up of my book.
227.689	"They described it as ""compelling and well-written."""
230.804	(Applause)
235.525	Blurb on the next book, right?
238.76	The point of all of this is to make us afraid,
242.4	but as a journalist, I have an unwavering faith
244.289	in the power of education.
246.12	Our best weapon is sunlight.
249.687	Dostoevsky wrote that the whole work of man
251.574	is to prove he's a man and not a piano key.
254.899	Over and over throughout history,
256.461	people in power have used fear
258.449	to silence the truth and to silence dissent.
262.248	It's time we strike a new note.
264.287	Thank you.
266.262	(Applause)
