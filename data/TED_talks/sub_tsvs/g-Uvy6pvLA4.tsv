12.489	Two years ago, I have to say there was no problem.
15.458	Two years ago, I knew exactly 
15.458	what an icon looked like.
19.516	It looks like this.
21.871	Everybody's icon, but also the default position
24.7	of a curator of Italian Renaissance 
24.7	paintings, which I was then.
28.523	And in a way, this is also another default selection.
32.215	Leonardo da Vinci's exquisitely soulful image
36.762	"of the ""Lady with an Ermine."""
38.062	And I use that word, soulful, deliberately.
40.605	Or then there's this, or rather these:
42.988	"the two versions of Leonardo's ""Virgin of the Rocks"""
45.642	that were about to come together 
45.642	in London for the very first time.
49.918	In the exhibition that I was then in 
49.918	the absolute throes of organizing.
54.102	I was literally up to my eyes in Leonardo,
57.539	and I had been for three years.
59.357	So, he was occupying every part of my brain.
63.779	Leonardo had taught me, during that three years,
66.62	about what a picture can do.
68.468	About taking you from your own 
68.468	material world into a spiritual world.
73.786	He said, actually, that he believed 
73.786	the job of the painter
76.677	was to paint everything that was visible 
76.677	and invisible in the universe.
81.128	That's a huge task. And yet, 
81.128	somehow he achieves it.
85.125	He shows us, I think, the human soul.
87.896	He shows us the capacity of ourselves
92.342	to move into a spiritual realm.
95.77	To see a vision of the universe that's 
95.77	more perfect than our own.
100.298	To see God's own plan, in some sense.
103.874	So this, in a sense, was really 
103.874	what I believed an icon was.
107.945	At about that time, I started talking to Tom Campbell,
111.803	director here of the Metropolitan Museum,
114.354	about what my next move might be.
117.678	The move, in fact, back to an earlier life,
120.449	one I'd begun at the British Museum,
122.407	back to the world of three dimensions --
124.926	of sculpture and of decorative arts --
127.158	to take over the department of European sculpture 
127.158	and decorative arts, here at the Met.
131.376	But it was an incredibly busy time.
132.816	All the conversations were done 
132.816	at very peculiar times of the day --
136.223	over the phone.
139.136	In the end, I accepted the job
141.2	without actually having been here.
142.573	Again, I'd been there a couple of years before,
145.125	but on that particular visit.
147.637	So, it was just before the time that 
147.637	the Leonardo show was due to open
151.729	when I finally made it back to the Met, to New York,
155.751	to see my new domain.
157.207	To see what European sculpture 
157.207	and decorative arts looked like,
161.15	beyond those Renaissance collections 
161.15	with which I was so already familiar.
165.941	And I thought, on that very first day, 
165.941	I better tour the galleries.
168.938	Fifty-seven of these galleries --
170.39	like 57 varieties of baked beans, I believe.
175.246	I walked through and I started in my comfort zone
175.246	in the Italian Renaissance.
181.367	And then I moved gradually around,
183.288	feeling a little lost sometimes.
186.39	My head, also still full of the Leonardo exhibition
189.443	that was about to open, and I came across this.
193.465	And I thought to myself: What the hell have I done?
201.395	There was absolutely no connection in my mind
204.748	at all and, in fact, if there was any emotion going on,
207.847	it was a kind of repulsion.
210.216	This object felt utterly and completely alien.
213.454	Silly at a level that I hadn't yet 
213.454	understood silliness to be.
218.917	And then it was made worse --
221.116	there were two of them.
222.961	(Laughter)
226.1	So, I started thinking about why it was, in fact,
229.067	that I disliked this object so much.
231.523	What was the anatomy of my distaste?
235.329	Well, so much gold, so vulgar.
238.797	You know, so nouveau riche, frankly.
242.651	Leonardo himself had preached 
242.651	against the use of gold,
245.564	so it was absolutely anathema at that moment.
248.999	And then there's little pretty sprigs 
248.999	of flowers everywhere. (Laughter)
254.427	And finally, that pink. That damned pink.
257.946	It's such an extraordinarily artificial color.
260.842	I mean, it's a color that I can't think of 
260.842	anything that you actually see in nature,
264.37	that looks that shade.
267.458	The object even has its own tutu. (Laughter)
271.198	This little flouncy, spangly, bottomy bit
273.558	that sits at the bottom of the vase.
275.593	It reminded me, in an odd kind of way,
277.966	of my niece's fifth birthday party.
280.065	Where all the little girls would come 
280.065	either as a princess or a fairy.
284.587	There was one who would come as a fairy princess.
286.468	You should have seen the looks.
288.89	(Laughter)
290.583	And I realize that this object was in my mind,
293.925	born from the same mind, from the same womb,
296.865	practically, as Barbie Ballerina. (Laughter)
302.089	And then there's the elephants. (Laughter)
305.611	Those extraordinary elephants
307.757	with their little, sort of strange, sinister expressions
310.481	and Greta Garbo eyelashes, with 
310.481	these golden tusks and so on.
315.778	I realized this was an elephant that had
317.554	absolutely nothing to do with a majestic 
317.554	march across the Serengeti.
323.287	It was a Dumbo nightmare. (Laughter)
328.782	But something more profound 
328.782	was happening as well.
331.628	These objects, it seemed to me,
333.057	were quintessentially the kind that I 
333.057	and my liberal left friends in London
337.366	had always seen as summing up
339.901	something deplorable about the French aristocracy
342.74	in the 18th century.
344.912	The label had told me that these pieces were made
347.701	by the SÃ¨vres Manufactory,
350.412	made of porcelain in the late 1750s,
353.637	and designed by a designer called 
353.637	Jean-Claude Duplessis,
356.768	actually somebody of extraordinary distinction
358.964	as I later learned.
361.441	But for me, they summed up a kind of,
366.249	that sort of sheer uselessness of the aristocracy
369.663	in the 18th century.
373.136	I and my colleagues had always thought
375.602	that these objects, in way, summed up the idea of,
378.558	you know -- no wonder there was a revolution.
380.922	Or, indeed, thank God there was a revolution.
385.465	There was a sort of idea really, that,
387.224	if you owned a vase like this,
389.897	then there was really only one fate possible.
393.621	(Laughter)
397.685	So, there I was -- in a sort of paroxysm of horror.
402.349	But I took the job and I went 
402.349	on looking at these vases.
406.309	I sort of had to because they're 
406.309	on a through route in the Met.
409.84	So, almost anywhere I went, there they were.
412.472	They had this kind of odd sort of fascination,
415.241	like a car accident.
418.259	Where I couldn't stop looking.
420.983	And as I did so, I started thinking:
423.205	Well, what are we actually looking at here?
427.733	And what I started with was understanding this
431.064	as really a supreme piece of design.
434.616	It took me a little time.
435.713	But, that tutu for example --
437.151	actually, this is a piece that 
437.151	does dance in its own way.
440.273	It has an extraordinary lightness
441.915	and yet, it is also amazing balanced.
444.43	It has these kinds of sculptural ingredients.
447.905	And then the play between --
449.544	actually really quite carefully disposed 
449.544	color and gilding, and the sculptural surface,
454.156	is really rather remarkable.
456.431	And then I realized that this piece went into the kiln
459.261	four times, at least four times 
459.261	in order to arrive at this.
462.651	How many moments for accident can you think of
465.705	that could have happened to this piece?
467.209	And then remember, not just one, but two.
469.771	So he's having to arrive at two exactly matched
474.036	vases of this kind.
476.548	And then this question of uselessness.
477.954	Well actually, the end of the trunks 
477.954	were originally candle holders.
482.913	So what you would have had 
482.913	were candles on either side.
486.663	Imagine that effect of candlelight on that surface.
489.219	On the slightly uneven pink, on the beautiful gold.
491.951	It would have glittered in an interior,
494.697	a little like a little firework.
497.779	And at that point, actually, 
497.779	a firework went off in my brain.
501.431	Somebody reminded me that, that word 'fancy' --
504.266	which in a sense for me, encapsulated this object --
507.376	actually comes from the same 
507.376	root as the word 'fantasy.'
511.422	And that what this object was just as much in a way,
514.038	in its own way, as a Leonardo da Vinci painting,
516.49	is a portal to somewhere else.
518.697	This is an object of the imagination.
522.892	If you think about the mad 18th-century 
522.892	operas of the time -- set in the Orient.
529.721	If you think about divans and perhaps even 
529.721	opium-induced visions of pink elephants,
536.2	then at that point, this object starts to make sense.
539.501	This is an object which is all about escapism.
543.557	It's about an escapism that happens --
546.754	that the aristocracy in France sought
548.775	very deliberately
550.561	to distinguish themselves from ordinary people.
555.129	It's not an escapism that
557.093	we feel particularly happy with today, however.
560.96	And again, going on thinking about this,
563.945	I realize that in a way we're all victims
567.119	of a certain kind of tyranny
569.13	of the triumph of modernism
571.151	whereby form and function in an object
573.877	have to follow one another, or are deemed to do so.
577.282	And the extraneous ornament is seen as really,
580.246	essentially, criminal.
583.266	It's a triumph, in a way, of bourgeois
583.266	values rather than aristocratic ones.
586.417	And that seems fine.
588.24	Except for the fact that it becomes a kind of 
588.24	sequestration of imagination.
595.697	So just as in the 20th century, so many people
598.387	had the idea that their faith
600.375	took place on the Sabbath day,
603.057	and the rest of their lives --
604.431	their lives of washing machines and orthodontics --
608.409	took place on another day.
610.441	Then, I think we've started doing the same.
614.209	We've allowed ourselves to
617.541	lead our fantasy lives in front of screens.
619.898	In the dark of the cinema, with the
619.898	television in the corner of the room.
623.88	We've eliminated, in a sense, that constant
627.958	of the imagination that these vases 
627.958	represented in people's lives.
632.886	So maybe it's time we got this back a little.
636.922	I think it's beginning to happen.
639.272	In London, for example,
640.538	with these extraordinary buildings
642.687	that have been appearing over the last few years.
645.678	Redolent, in a sense, of science fiction,
648.081	turning London into a kind of fantasy playground.
650.195	It's actually amazing to look out of 
650.195	a high building nowadays there.
655.049	But even then, there's a resistance.
656.853	London has called these buildings the 
656.853	Gherkin, the Shard, the Walkie Talkie --
661.189	bringing these soaring buildings down to Earth.
664.494	There's an idea that we don't want these
668.574	anxious-making, imaginative journeys 
668.574	to happen in our daily lives.
673.435	I feel lucky in a way,
676.703	I've encountered this object.
679.251	(Laughter)
681.692	I found him on the Internet when 
681.692	I was looking up a reference.
684.994	And there he was.
687.888	And unlike the pink elephant vase,
691.202	this was a kind of love at first sight.
693.175	In fact, reader, I married him. I bought him.
696.031	And he now adorns my office.
699.895	He's a Staffordshire figure made 
699.895	in the middle of the 19th century.
703.436	He represents the actor, Edmund Kean, 
703.436	playing Shakespeare's Richard III.
708.242	And it's based, actually, on a more 
708.242	elevated piece of porcelain.
710.695	So I loved, on an art historical level,
712.849	I loved that layered quality that he has.
717.509	But more than that, I love him.
720.002	In a way that I think would have been impossible
721.68	without the pink SÃ¨vres vase in my Leonardo days.
724.292	I love his orange and pink breeches.
727.509	I love the fact that he seems to be going off to war,
730.259	having just finished the washing up. (Laughter)
734.691	He seems also to have forgotten his sword.
737.168	I love his pink little cheeks, his munchkin energy.
739.787	In a way, he's become my sort of alter ego.
742.978	He's, I hope, a little bit dignified,
745.279	but mostly rather vulgar. (Laughter)
750.453	And energetic, I hope, too.
753.671	I let him into my life because the SÃ¨vres
753.671	pink elephant vase allowed me to do so.
758.826	And before that Leonardo,
760.394	I understood that this object could become 
760.394	part of a journey for me every day,
765.5	sitting in my office.
768.245	I really hope that others, all of you,
771.234	visiting objects in the museum,
772.809	and taking them home and 
772.809	finding them for yourselves,
775.263	will allow those objects to flourish 
775.263	in your imaginative lives.
779.577	Thank you very much.
781.13	(Applause)
