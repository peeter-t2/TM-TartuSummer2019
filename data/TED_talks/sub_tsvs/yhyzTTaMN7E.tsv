15.766	I would like to talk to you about
17.62	a very special group of animals.
20.252	There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
24.253	Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds.
28.861	When you see a vulture like this, the first thing
31.873	that comes to your mind is, these are disgusting, ugly,
35.849	greedy creatures that are just after your flesh,
38.808	associated with politicians. (Laughter) (Applause)
46.135	I want to change that perception. I want to change
48.91	those feelings you have for these birds, because
51.62	they need our sympathy. They really do. (Laughter)
54.67	And I'll tell you why.
56.219	First of all, why do they have such a bad press?
59.811	When Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in 1832
63.798	on the Beagle, he saw the turkey vulture,
66.99	"and he said, ""These are disgusting birds"
69.83	"with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity."" (Laughter)"
75.891	You could not get a worse insult, and that from Charles Darwin. (Laughter)
80.461	You know, he changed his mind when he came back,
83.322	and I'll tell you why.
84.638	They've also be associated with Disney — (Laughter) —
87.929	personified as goofy, dumb, stupid characters.
92.721	More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press
96.297	— (Laughter) (Applause) (Cheers) —
103.416	these are the attributes that they associated
106.768	the Kenyan MPs with. But I want to challenge that.
110.08	I want to challenge that. Do you know why?
112.632	Because MPs
115.352	do not keep the environment clean. (Laughter)
120.223	MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases.
125.185	They are hardly monogamous. (Laughter) (Applause)
131.534	They are far from being extinct. (Laughter)
135.297	And, my favorite is, vultures are better looking. (Applause) (Laughter)
142.198	So there's two types of vultures in this planet.
146.149	There are the New World vultures that are mainly found
148.422	in the Americas, like the condors and the caracaras,
151.363	and then the Old World vultures, where we have
157.15	a high risk of extinction.
160.237	So why are vultures important? First of all,
163.654	they provide vital ecological services. They clean up.
167.135	They're our natural garbage collectors.
169.429	They clean up carcasses right to the bone.
172.062	They help to kill all the bacteria. They help absorb anthrax
175.7	that would otherwise spread and cause
178.373	huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals.
182.457	Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are
185.196	no vultures, carcasses take up to three to four times
188.199	to decompose, and this has huge ramifications
190.768	for the spread of diseases.
193.663	Vultures also have tremendous historical significance.
197.079	They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture.
200.323	Nekhbet was the symbol of the protector
203.423	and the motherhood, and together with the cobra,
206.511	symbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt.
210.625	In Hindu mythology, Jatayu was the vulture god,
214.433	and he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita
219.705	from the 10-headed demon Ravana.
222.362	In Tibetan culture, they are performing very important
225.793	sky burials. In places like Tibet, there are no places
228.505	to bury the dead, or wood to cremate them,
231.569	so these vultures provide a natural disposal system.
235.757	So what is the problem with vultures?
238.224	We have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya,
241.095	of which six are highly threatened with extinction.
245.082	The reason is that they're getting poisoned, and the reason
247.701	that they're getting poisoned is because there's
250.293	human-wildlife conflicts. The pastoral communities
252.981	are using this poison to target predators,
256.333	and in return, the vultures are falling victim to this.
259.968	In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan,
262.632	four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered,
266.113	which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct,
269.464	and the reason is because they are falling prey
272.774	by consuming livestock that has been treated
275.222	with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac.
277.894	This drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India,
280.991	and they have taken a stand.
283.51	Because there are no vultures, there's been a spread
285.83	in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites,
288.631	and when you have feral dogs, you have a huge time bomb
291.812	of rabies. The number of cases of rabies
294.454	has increased tremendously in India.
297.182	Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa:
303.863	I am not against wind energy, but we need to work
306.143	with the governments, because wind turbines
309.352	do this to birds. They slice them in half.
311.952	They are bird-blending machines.
314.786	In West Africa, there's a horrific trade
317.464	of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market.
322.835	So what's being done? Well, we're conducting research
325.667	on these birds. We're putting transmitters on them.
328.947	We're trying to determine their basic ecology,
331.323	and see where they go.
333.762	We can see that they travel different countries, so
335.803	if you focus on a problem locally, it's not going to help you.
339.099	We need to work with governments in regional levels.
341.806	We're working with local communities.
344.742	We're talking to them about appreciating vultures,
347.884	about the need from within to appreciate these
350.439	wonderful creatures and the services that they provide.
353.476	How can you help? You can become active,
356.489	make noise. You can write a letter to your government
359.212	and tell them that we need to focus on these very
361.522	misunderstood creatures. Volunteer your time
364.7	to spread the word. Spread the word.
367.316	When you walk out of this room, you will be informed
369.66	about vultures, but speak to your families, to your children,
372.46	to your neighbors about vultures.
374.621	They are very graceful. Charles Darwin said
377.684	he changed his mind because he watched them fly
380.713	effortlessly without energy in the skies.
383.978	Kenya, this world, will be much poorer
386.857	without these wonderful species.
389.442	Thank you very much. (Applause)
