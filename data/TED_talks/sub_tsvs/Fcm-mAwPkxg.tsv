13.084	Like many of us,
14.818	I've had several careers in my life,
17.214	and although they've been varied,
19.389	my first job set the foundation
19.389	for all of them.
23.3	I was a home-birth midwife
23.3	throughout my 20s.
27.623	Delivering babies taught me
27.623	valuable and sometimes surprising things,
32.771	like how to start a car at 2am.
35.565	when it's 10 degrees below zero.
37.387	(Laughter)
38.412	Or how to revive a father
38.412	who's fainted at the sight of blood.
42.771	(Laughter)
43.846	Or how to cut the umbilical cord just so,
46.316	to make a beautiful belly button.
48.561	But those aren't the things
48.561	that stuck with me or guided me
52.37	when I stopped being a midwife
52.37	and started other jobs.
56.378	What stuck with me was this bedrock belief
60.495	that each one of us comes into this world
60.495	with a unique worth.
66.282	When I looked into the face of a newborn,
70.192	I caught a glimpse of that worthiness,
73.909	that sense of unapologetic selfhood,
76.775	that unique spark.
80.586	"I use the word ""soul"""
80.586	to describe that spark,
84.367	because it's the only word in English
84.367	that comes close to naming
89.03	what each baby brought into the room.
92.623	Every newborn was as singular
92.623	as a snowflake,
97.315	a matchless mash-up of biology
100.71	and ancestry and mystery.
103.914	And then that baby grows up,
106.055	and in order to fit into the family,
108.194	to conform to the culture,
110.259	to the community, to the gender,
113.174	that little one begins to cover its soul,
116.14	layer by layer.
118.197	We're born this way,
120.405	but --
121.587	(Laughter)
123.203	But as we grow, a lot
123.203	of things happen to us
126.64	that make us ...
129.815	want to hide our soulful
129.815	eccentricities and authenticity.
134.983	We've all done this.
136.374	Everyone in this room is a former baby --
139.237	(Laughter)
140.283	with a distinctive birthright.
143.56	But as adults, we spend so much
143.56	of our time uncomfortable in our own skin,
148.8	like we have ADD:
148.8	authenticity deficit disorder.
153.449	But not those babies --
155.081	not yet.
156.347	Their message to me was:
158.453	uncover your soul
160.728	and look for that soul-spark
163.945	in everyone else.
165.179	It's still there.
167.172	And here's what I learned
167.172	from laboring women.
170.414	Their message was about staying open,
173.438	even when things are painful.
176.584	A woman's cervix normally looks like this.
179.036	It's a tight little muscle
181.21	at the base of the uterus.
183.243	And during labor,
183.243	it has to stretch from this
187.576	to this.
188.982	Ouch!
190.269	If you fight against that pain,
193.343	you just create more pain,
195.051	and you block what wants to be born.
198.482	I'll never forget the magic
198.482	that would happen
202.344	when a woman stopped resisting the pain
206.185	and opened.
207.496	It was as if the forces
207.496	of the universe took notice
211.211	and sent in a wave of help.
213.973	I never forgot that message,
215.919	and now, when difficult
215.919	or painful things happen to me
219.963	in my life or my work,
221.909	of course at first I resist them,
224.561	but then I remember
224.561	what I learned from the mothers:
227.809	stay open.
229.508	Stay curious.
230.961	Ask the pain what it's come to deliver.
234.017	Something new wants to be born.
237.311	And there was one more big soulful lesson,
239.633	and that one I learned
239.633	from Albert Einstein.
242.769	He wasn't at any of the births, but --
244.749	(Laughter)
245.805	It was a lesson about time.
249.732	At the end of his life,
249.732	Albert Einstein concluded
253.909	that our normal, hamster-wheel
253.909	experience of life
258.083	is an illusion.
259.843	We run round and round, faster and faster,
262.26	trying to get somewhere.
264.455	And all the while,
267.218	underneath surface time
267.218	is this whole other dimension
271.288	where the past and the present
271.288	and the future merge
276.367	and become deep time.
279.414	And there's nowhere to get to.
282.716	Albert Einstein called
282.716	this state, this dimension,
287.089	"""only being."""
288.774	And he said when he experienced it,
290.754	he knew sacred awe.
293.818	When I was delivering babies,
295.491	I was forced off the hamster wheel.
297.41	Sometimes I had to sit for days,
297.41	hours and hours,
301.213	just breathing with the parents;
303.823	just being.
305.659	And I got a big dose of sacred awe.
309.156	So those are the three lessons
309.156	I took with me from midwifery.
314.253	One: uncover your soul.
317.376	Two: when things get difficult
317.376	or painful, try to stay open.
323.568	And three: every now and then,
323.568	step off your hamster wheel
327.928	into deep time.
330.946	Those lessons have served me
330.946	throughout my life,
334.855	but they really served me recently,
337.338	when I took on the most
337.338	important job of my life thus far.
342.572	Two years ago, my younger sister
342.572	came out of remission
346.962	from a rare blood cancer,
349.719	and the only treatment left for her
349.719	was a bone marrow transplant.
354.708	And against the odds,
354.708	we found a match for her,
357.821	who turned out to be me.
360.794	I come from a family of four girls,
364.075	and when my sisters found out that
364.075	I was my sister's perfect genetic match,
370.512	"their reaction was, ""Really? You?"""
372.866	(Laughter)
374.273	"""A perfect match for her?"""
376.453	Which is pretty typical for siblings.
379.488	In a sibling society,
379.488	there's lots of things.
382.221	There's love and there's friendship
382.221	and there's protection.
386.442	But there's also jealousy
388.603	and competition
390.6	and rejection and attack.
393.867	In siblinghood, that's where we start
393.867	assembling many of those first layers
399.829	that cover our soul.
402.106	When I discovered I was my sister's match,
405.133	I went into research mode.
407.194	And I discovered that
410.028	the premise of transplants
410.028	is pretty straightforward.
412.786	You destroy all the bone marrow
412.786	in the cancer patient
416.07	with massive doses of chemotherapy,
419.293	and then you replace that marrow
421.727	with several million healthy
421.727	marrow cells from a donor.
425.937	And then you do everything you can
427.767	to make sure that those new cells
427.767	engraft in the patient.
432.076	I also learned that bone marrow
432.076	transplants are fraught with danger.
437.468	If my sister made it
437.468	through the near-lethal chemotherapy,
442.734	she still would face other challenges.
445.942	My cells
448.863	might attack her body.
451.843	And her body might reject my cells.
454.846	They call this rejection or attack,
457.315	and both could kill her.
459.583	Rejection. Attack.
462.091	Those words had a familiar ring
464.306	in the context of being siblings.
467.843	My sister and I had
467.843	a long history of love,
470.676	but we also had a long history
470.676	of rejection and attack,
474.487	from minor misunderstandings
474.487	to bigger betrayals.
479.172	We didn't have
479.172	the kind of the relationship
481.33	where we talked about the deeper stuff;
483.887	but, like many siblings and like people
483.887	in all kinds of relationships,
488.987	we were hesitant to tell our truths,
491.965	to reveal our wounds,
494.867	to admit our wrongdoings.
497.18	But when I learned about
497.18	the dangers of rejection or attack,
502.095	I thought, it's time to change this.
505.073	What if we left the bone marrow
505.073	transplant up to the doctors,
509.913	but did something that we later came
509.913	"to call our ""soul marrow transplant?"""
516.205	What if we faced any pain
516.205	we had caused each other,
520.215	and instead of rejection or attack,
523.454	could we listen?
525.272	Could we forgive?
527.116	Could we merge?
528.58	Would that teach our cells to do the same?
533.431	To woo my skeptical sister,
533.431	I turned to my parents' holy text:
538.268	the New Yorker Magazine.
539.893	(Laughter)
541.833	I sent her a cartoon from its pages
545.428	as a way of explaining
545.428	why we should visit a therapist
549.077	before having my bone marrow harvested
549.077	and transplanted into her body.
554.467	Here it is.
555.736	"""I have never forgiven him for that thing"
555.736	"I made up in my head."""
559.874	(Laughter)
562.305	I told my sister
564.95	we had probably been doing the same thing,
567.811	carting around made-up stories
567.811	in our heads that kept us separate.
574.184	And I told her that after the transplant,
577.1	all of the blood flowing in her veins
579.718	would be my blood,
581.223	made from my marrow cells,
584.301	and that inside the nucleus
584.301	of each of those cells
588.554	is a complete set of my DNA.
591.351	"""I will be swimming around in you"
591.351	"for the rest of your life,"""
594.755	I told my slightly horrified sister.
597.538	(Laughter)
599.742	"""I think we better clean up"
599.742	"our relationship."""
604.168	A health crisis makes people
604.168	do all sorts of risky things,
607.512	like quitting a job
607.512	or jumping out of an airplane
611.603	and, in the case of my sister,
613.618	"saying ""yes"" to several therapy sessions,"
617.723	during which we got down to the marrow.
623.588	We looked at and released years of stories
628.005	and assumptions about each other
630.11	and blame and shame
632.212	until all that was left was love.
638.175	People have said I was brave
638.175	to undergo the bone marrow harvest,
642.387	but I don't think so.
644.1	What felt brave to me
646.214	was that other kind
646.214	of harvest and transplant,
649.423	the soul marrow transplant,
651.772	getting emotionally naked
651.772	with another human being,
655.774	putting aside pride and defensiveness,
659.267	lifting the layers
661.559	and sharing with each other
661.559	our vulnerable souls.
666.416	I called on those midwife lessons:
669.239	uncover your soul.
671.963	Open to what's scary and painful.
674.628	Look for the sacred awe.
677.872	Here I am with my marrow cells
677.872	after the harvest.
681.161	"That's they call it -- ""harvest,"""
683.085	like it's some kind of bucolic
683.085	farm-to-table event --
686.309	(Laughter)
687.491	Which I can assure you it is not.
691.522	And here is my brave, brave sister
694.881	receiving my cells.
697.768	After the transplant, we began to spend
697.768	more and more time together.
702.289	It was as if we were little girls again.
705.537	The past and the present merged.
708.529	We entered deep time.
711.331	I left the hamster wheel of work and life
715.631	to join my sister
717.992	on that lonely island
720.444	of illness and healing.
722.948	We spent months together --
724.815	in the isolation unit,
726.601	in the hospital and in her home.
730.411	Our fast-paced society
732.124	does not support or even value
732.124	this kind of work.
737.308	We see it as a disruption
737.308	of real life and important work.
741.426	We worry about the emotional drain
741.426	and the financial cost --
745.678	and, yes, there is a financial cost.
749.277	But I was paid
751.59	in the kind of currency our culture
751.59	seems to have forgotten all about.
757.132	I was paid in love.
759.629	I was paid in soul.
761.398	I was paid in my sister.
764.792	My sister said the year after transplant
764.792	was the best year of her life,
770.008	which was surprising.
771.281	She suffered so much.
774.364	But she said life never tasted as sweet,
778.004	and that because of the soul-baring
780.772	and the truth-telling
780.772	we had done with each other,
783.721	she became more unapologetically herself
787.561	with everyone.
788.976	She said things
788.976	she'd always needed to say.
791.968	She did things she always wanted to do.
795.263	The same happened for me.
797.246	I became braver about being authentic
797.246	with the people in my life.
803.917	I said my truths,
805.634	but more important than that,
805.634	I sought the truth of others.
811.713	It wasn't until
811.713	the final chapter of this story
815.121	that I realized just how well
815.121	midwifery had trained me.
819.214	After that best year of my sister's life,
822.153	the cancer came roaring back,
824.702	and this time there was nothing more
824.702	the doctors could do.
827.998	They gave her just
827.998	a couple of months to live.
832.196	The night before my sister died,
835.163	I sat by her bedside.
837.895	She was so small and thin.
840.766	I could see the blood pulsing in her neck.
843.869	It was my blood, her blood, our blood.
848.462	When she died, part of me would die, too.
852.687	I tried to make sense of it all,
857.383	how becoming one with each other
860.008	had made us more ourselves,
862.041	our soul selves,
864.249	and how by facing and opening
864.249	to the pain of our past,
869.466	we'd finally been delivered to each other,
872.651	and how by stepping out of time,
874.925	we would now be connected forever.
878.98	My sister left me with so many things,
882.365	and I'm going to leave you now
882.365	with just one of them.
885.565	You don't have to wait
885.565	for a life-or-death situation
890.497	to clean up the relationships
890.497	that matter to you,
893.64	to offer the marrow of your soul
897.157	and to seek it in another.
900.297	We can all do this.
902.239	We can be like a new kind
902.239	of first responder,
907.106	like the one to take
907.106	the first courageous step
911.906	toward the other,
913.682	and to do something or try to do something
916.951	other than rejection or attack.
920.545	We can do this with our siblings
922.735	and our mates
924.161	and our friends and our colleagues.
926.441	We can do this with the disconnection
929.093	and the discord all around us.
932.41	We can do this for the soul of the world.
936.629	Thank you.
937.844	(Applause)
