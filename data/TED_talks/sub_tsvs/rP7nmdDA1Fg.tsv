13.793	So, people are more afraid of insects
13.793	than they are of dying.
18.809	(Laughter)
20.611	At least, according to a 1973
20.611	"""Book of Lists"" survey"
25.143	which preceded all those online best,
25.143	worst, funniest lists that you see today.
32.167	Only heights and public speaking
35.829	exceeded the six-legged
35.829	as sources of fear.
39.884	And I suspect if you had put
39.884	spiders in there,
43.46	the combinations of insects and spiders
43.46	would have just topped the chart.
48.736	Now, I am not one of those people.
50.863	I really love insects.
53.033	I think they're interesting and beautiful,
57.108	and sometimes even cute.
58.62	(Laughter)
60.111	And I'm not alone.
61.503	For centuries, some
61.503	of the greatest minds in science,
65.233	from Charles Darwin to E.O. Wilson,
68.269	have drawn inspiration from studying
68.269	some of the smallest minds on Earth.
74.661	Well, why is that?
76.386	What is that keeps us
76.386	coming back to insects?
80.055	Some of it, of course, is just the sheer
80.055	magnitude of almost everything about them.
84.678	They're more numerous
84.678	than any other kind of animal.
87.689	We don't even know how many species
87.689	of insects there are,
90.537	because new ones
90.537	are being discovered all the time.
93.278	There are at least a million,
93.278	maybe as many as 10 million.
97.221	This means that you could have
97.221	an insect-of-the-month calendar
101.509	and not have to reuse a species
101.509	for over 80,000 years.
105.518	(Laughter)
108.442	Take that, pandas and kittens!
110.154	(Laughter)
112.506	More seriously, insects are essential.
115.998	We need them.
117.469	It's been estimated
117.469	that 1 out of every 3 bites of food
120.893	is made possible by a pollinator.
124.972	Scientist use insects to make fundamental
124.972	discoveries
128.223	about everything from the structure
128.223	of our nervous systems
131.148	to how our genes and DNA work.
134.388	But what I love most about insects
136.29	is what they can tell us
136.29	about our own behavior.
139.539	Insects seem like they do
139.539	everything that people do.
142.62	They meet, they mate,
142.62	they fight, they break up.
146.509	And they do so with what looks
146.509	like love or animosity.
151.665	But what drives their behaviors is really
151.665	different than what drives our own,
156.9	and that difference
156.9	can be really illuminating.
160.234	There's nowhere where that's more true
162.125	than when it comes to one
162.125	of our most consuming interests -- sex.
166.142	Now, I will maintain.
166.142	and I think I can defend,
168.999	what may seem like a surprising statement.
172.749	I think sex in insects is more
172.749	interesting than sex in people.
176.32	(Laughter)
178.131	And the wild variety that we see
181.294	makes us challenge
181.294	some of our own assumptions
184.231	about what it means to be male and female.
187.663	Of course, to start with,
189.338	a lot of insects don't need
189.338	to have sex at all to reproduce.
192.319	Female aphids can make little, tiny clones
192.319	of themselves without ever mating.
197.441	Virgin birth, right there.
198.938	On your rose bushes.
200.25	(Laughter)
203.47	When they do have sex,
205.035	even their sperm is more
205.035	interesting than human sperm.
208.316	There are some kinds of fruit flies
210.715	whose sperm is longer
210.715	than the male's own body.
214.216	And that's important because the males
214.216	use their sperm to compete.
218.873	Now, male insects do compete with weapons,
218.873	like the horns on these beetles.
223.553	But they also compete
223.553	after mating with their sperm.
228.726	Dragonflies and damselflies have penises
228.726	that look kind of like Swiss Army knives
233.876	with all of the attachments pulled out.
235.993	(Laughter)
237.887	They use these formidable devices
237.887	like scoops,
242.057	to remove the sperm from previous males
242.057	that the female has mated with.
246.818	(Laughter)
248.909	So, what can we learn from this?
251.63	(Laughter)
257.333	All right, it is not a lesson in the sense
257.333	of us imitating them
262.367	or of them setting
262.367	an example for us to follow.
265.915	Which, given this,
265.915	is probably just as well.
269.265	And also, did I mention sexual cannibalism
269.265	is rampant among insects?
272.863	So, no, that's not the point.
275.215	But what I think insects do,
276.976	is break a lot of the rules
276.976	that we humans have about the sex roles.
283.319	So, people have this idea that nature
283.319	dictates kind of a 1950s sitcom version
288.872	of what males and females are like.
290.851	So that males are always
290.851	supposed to be dominant and aggressive,
294.028	and females are passive and coy.
295.794	But that's just not the case.
298.606	So for example, take katydids,
300.692	which are relatives of crickets
300.692	and grasshoppers.
303.558	The males are very picky
303.558	about who they mate with,
307.059	because they not only transfer
307.059	sperm during mating,
310.308	they also give the female
310.308	something called a nuptial gift.
314.798	You can see two katydids
314.798	mating in these photos.
318.499	In both panels,
318.499	the male's the one on the right,
320.843	and that sword-like appendage
320.843	is the female's egg-laying organ.
325.126	The white blob is the sperm,
327.677	the green blob is the nuptial gift,
331.087	and the male manufactures
331.087	this from his own body
334.477	and it's extremely costly to produce.
336.679	It can weigh up to a third
336.679	of his body mass.
339.985	I will now pause for a moment
339.985	and let you think about
342.543	what it would be like if human men,
342.543	every time they had sex,
346.73	had to produce something
346.73	that weighed 50, 60, 70 pounds.
352.801	(Laughter)
356.432	Okay, they would not be able
356.432	to do that very often.
359.695	(Laughter)
361.216	And indeed, neither can the katydids.
364.343	And so what that means
366.279	is the katydid males are very choosy
370.111	about who they offer
370.111	these nuptial gifts to.
373.215	Now, the gift is very nutritious,
375.165	and the female eats it
375.165	during and after mating.
377.883	So, the bigger it is,
377.883	the better off the male is,
380.264	because that means more time for his sperm
382.464	to drain into her body
382.464	and fertilize her eggs.
385.521	But it also means that the males
385.521	are very passive about mating,
389.895	whereas the females
389.895	are extremely aggressive and competitive,
393.444	in an attempt to get as many of these
393.444	nutritious nuptial gifts as they can.
397.784	So, it's not exactly
397.784	a stereotypical set of rules.
402.974	Even more generally though,
404.709	males are actually not all that important
404.709	in the lives of a lot of insects.
409.797	In the social insects --
409.797	the bees and wasps and ants --
414.25	the individuals that you see every day --
416.869	the ants going back and forth
416.869	to your sugar bowl,
419.338	the honey bees that are flitting
419.338	from flower to flower --
422.371	all of those are always female.
425.3	People have had a hard time getting
425.3	their head around that idea for millennia.
429.9	The ancient Greeks knew that there was
429.9	a class of bees, the drones,
435.022	that are larger than the workers,
437.097	although they disapproved
437.097	of the drones' laziness
439.691	because they could see that
439.691	the drones just hang around the hive
442.77	until the mating flight --
444.319	they're the males.
445.562	They hang around until the mating flight,
447.605	but they don't participate
447.605	in gathering nectar or pollen.
450.368	The Greeks couldn't figure out
450.368	the drones' sex,
452.676	and part of the confusion was that they
452.676	were aware of the stinging ability of bees
457.267	but they found it difficult to believe
460.148	that any animals that bore such a weapon
460.148	could possibly be a female.
463.705	Aristotle tried to get involved as well.
466.739	"He suggested, ""OK, if the stinging"
466.739	"individuals are going to be the males ..."""
471.351	Then he got confused,
471.351	because that would have meant
473.841	the males were also taking care
473.841	of the young in a colony,
476.594	and he seemed to think
476.594	that would be completely impossible.
481.026	He then concluded that maybe
481.026	bees had the organs of both sexes
484.099	in the same individual,
485.274	which is not that far-fetched,
485.274	some animals do that,
487.867	but he never really
487.867	did get it figured out.
490.744	And you know, even today,
490.744	my students, for instance,
494.554	call every animal they see,
494.554	including insects, a male.
499.585	And when I tell them
499.585	that the ferocious army-ant soldiers
503.145	with their giant jaws,
503.145	used to defend the colony,
506.102	are all always female,
509.228	they seem to not quite believe me.
511.586	(Laughter)
512.755	And certainly all of the movies --
512.755	Antz, Bee Movie --
517.979	portray the main character
517.979	in the social insects as being male.
524.869	Well, what difference does this make?
526.697	These are movies. They're fiction.
528.358	They have talking animals in them.
530.004	What difference does it make
530.004	if they talk like Jerry Seinfeld?
533.708	I think it does matter,
535.896	and it's a problem that actually
535.896	is part of a much deeper one
538.784	that has implications
538.784	for medicine and health
542.937	and a lot of other aspects of our lives.
545.595	You all know that scientists
545.595	use what we call model systems,
549.112	which are creatures --
549.112	white rats or fruit flies --
552.497	that are kind of stand-ins
552.497	for all other animals, including people.
557.075	And the idea is
557.075	that what's true for a person
560.043	will also be true for the white rat.
562.478	And by and large,
562.478	that turns out to be the case.
565.482	But you can take the idea
565.482	of a model system too far.
569.924	And what I think we've done,
572.217	is use males, in any species,
572.217	as though they are the model system.
577.692	The norm.
578.939	The way things are supposed to be.
581.51	And females as a kind of variant --
584.583	something special that you only study
584.583	after you get the basics down.
589.802	And so, back to the insects.
592.509	I think what that means
593.881	is that people just couldn't see
593.881	what was in front of them.
596.724	Because they assumed that the world's
596.724	stage was largely occupied by male players
603.184	and females would only have
603.184	minor, walk-on roles.
607.626	But when we do that, we really miss out
607.626	on a lot of what nature is like.
613.588	And we can also miss out on the way
613.588	natural, living things, including people,
620.611	can vary.
622.025	And I think that's why we've used males
622.025	as models in a lot of medical research,
627.124	something that we know now to be a problem
629.213	if we want the results to apply
629.213	to both men and women.
634.76	Well, the last thing
634.76	I really love about insects
637.311	is something that a lot of people
637.311	find unnerving about them.
640.596	They have little, tiny brains
642.387	with very little cognitive ability,
642.387	the way we normally think of it.
646.398	They have complicated behavior,
646.398	but they lack complicated brains.
651.86	And so, we can't just think of them
651.86	as though they're little people
657.061	because they don't do things
657.061	the way that we do.
660.63	I really love that it's difficult
660.63	to anthropomorphize insects,
664.754	to look at them and just think of them
664.754	like they're little people
668.301	in exoskeletons, with six legs.
670.927	(Laughter)
672.212	Instead, you really have to accept them
672.212	on their own terms,
675.781	because insects make us question
675.781	what's normal and what's natural.
681.527	Now, you know, people write fiction
681.527	and talk about parallel universes.
686.184	They speculate about the supernatural,
689.506	maybe the spirits of the departed
689.506	walking among us.
694.537	The allure of another world
697.757	is something that people say is part of
697.757	why they want to dabble in the paranormal.
704.376	But as far as I'm concerned,
706.689	who needs to be able to see dead people,
708.882	when you can see live insects?
711.262	Thank you.
712.448	(Applause)
