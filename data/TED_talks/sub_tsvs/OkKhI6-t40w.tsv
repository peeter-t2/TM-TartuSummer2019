30.26	Tyler Dewar: The way I feel right now
32.26	is that all of the other speakers
34.26	have said exactly what I wanted to say.
36.26	(Laughter)
38.26	And it seems that the only thing left for me to say
41.26	is to thank you all for your kindness.
58.26	TD: But maybe in the spirit
60.26	of appreciating the kindness of you all,
62.26	I could share with you
64.26	a little story about myself.
110.26	TD: From the time I was very young, onward,
113.26	I was given
115.26	a lot of different responsibilities,
117.26	and it always seemed to me, when I was young,
120.26	that everything was laid out before me.
122.26	All of the plans for me were already made.
125.26	I was given the clothes that I needed to wear
127.26	and told where I needed to be,
129.26	given these very precious
131.26	and holy looking robes to wear,
134.26	with the understanding
136.26	that it was something sacred or important.
187.26	TD: But before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me,
191.26	I was living in eastern Tibet with my family.
194.26	And when I was seven years old,
197.26	all of a sudden,
199.26	a search party arrived at my home.
201.26	They were looking the next Karmapa,
204.26	and I noticed they were talking to my mom and dad,
207.26	and the news came to me that they were telling me
210.26	that I was the Karmapa.
212.26	And these days, people ask me a lot,
214.26	how did that feel.
216.26	How did that feel when they came and whisked you away,
218.26	and your lifestyle completely changed?
220.26	And what I mostly say is that,
222.26	at that time,
224.26	it was a pretty interesting idea to me.
227.26	I thought that things would be pretty fun
229.26	and there would be more things to play with.
232.26	(Laughter)
296.26	TD: But it didn't turn out to be so fun and entertaining,
299.26	as I thought it would have been.
301.26	I was placed
303.26	in a pretty strictly controlled environment.
306.26	And immediately,
308.26	a lot of different responsibilities,
310.26	in terms of my education and so forth, were heaped upon me.
313.26	I was separated, largely, from my family,
315.26	including my mother and father.
317.26	I didn't have have many personal friends
319.26	to spend time with,
321.26	but I was expected to perform
323.26	these prescribed duties.
325.26	So it turned out that my fantasy
328.26	about an entertaining life of being the Karmapa
330.26	wasn't going to come true.
332.26	It more felt to be the case to me
334.26	that I was being treated like a statue,
337.26	and I was to sit in one place
340.26	like a statue would.
391.26	TD: Nevertheless, I felt that,
393.26	even though I've been separated from my loved ones --
396.26	and, of course, now I'm even further away.
399.26	When I was 14, I escaped from Tibet
401.26	and became even further removed
403.26	from my mother and father,
405.26	my relatives, my friends
407.26	and my homeland.
409.26	But nevertheless,
411.26	there's no real sense of separation from me in my heart,
414.26	in terms of the love that I feel
417.26	for these people.
419.26	I feel, still, a very strong connection of love
422.26	for all of these people
424.26	and for the land.
452.26	TD: And I still do
454.26	get to keep in touch with my mother and father,
456.26	albeit infrequently.
458.26	I talk to my mother
460.26	once in a blue moon on the telephone.
462.26	And my experience is that,
464.26	when I'm talking to her,
466.26	with every second that passes
468.26	during our conversation,
470.26	the feeling of love that binds us
473.26	is bringing us closer and closer together.
548.26	TD: So those were just a few remarks
550.26	about my personal background.
552.26	And in terms of other things that I wanted to share with you,
555.26	in terms of ideas,
557.26	I think it's wonderful to have a situation like this,
560.26	where so many people from different backgrounds and places
563.26	can come together,
565.26	exchange their ideas
567.26	and form relationships of friendship with each other.
570.26	And I think that's symbolic
572.26	of what we're seeing in the world in general,
574.26	that the world is becoming smaller and smaller,
576.26	and that all of the peoples in the world
579.26	are enjoying more opportunities for connection.
583.26	That's wonderful,
585.26	but we should also remember
587.26	that we should have a similar process happening on the inside.
590.26	Along with outward development
592.26	and increase of opportunity,
594.26	there should be inward development
597.26	and deepening of our heart connections
600.26	as well as our outward connections.
604.26	So we spoke and we heard some
606.26	about design this week.
608.26	I think that it's important for us to remember
610.26	that we need
612.26	to keep pushing forward
614.26	on the endeavor
616.26	of the design of the heart.
618.26	We heard a lot about technology this week,
620.26	and it's important for us to remember
622.26	to invest a lot of our energy
625.26	in improving the technology of the heart.
647.26	TD: So, even though I'm somewhat happy
649.26	about the wonderful developments that are happening in the world,
652.26	still, I feel a sense of impediment,
655.26	when it comes
657.26	to the ability that we have
659.26	to connect with each other on a heart-to-heart, or a mind-to-mind, level.
662.26	I feel that there are some things
665.26	that are getting in the way.
703.26	TC: My relationship
705.26	to this concept of heart-to-heart connection, or mind-to-mind connection,
708.26	is an interesting one,
710.26	because, as a spiritual leader, I'm always attempting
712.26	to open my heart to others
714.26	and offer myself up
716.26	for heart-to-heart and mind-to-mind connections
718.26	in a genuine way with other people,
720.26	but at the same time,
722.26	I've always been advised
724.26	that I need to emphasize intelligence
726.26	over the heart-to-heart connections,
728.26	because, being someone in a position like mine,
732.26	if I don't rely primarily on intelligence,
735.26	then something dangerous may happen to me.
739.26	So it's an interesting paradox at play there.
745.26	But I had a really striking experience once,
748.26	when a group from Afghanistan
750.26	came to visit me,
752.26	and we had a really interesting conversation.
850.26	TD: So we ended up talking about the Bamiyan Buddhas,
853.26	which, as you know,
855.26	were destroyed some years ago in Afghanistan.
859.26	But the basis of our conversation
861.26	was the different approach to spirituality
863.26	on the part of the Muslim
865.26	and Buddhist traditions.
867.26	Of course, in Muslim,
869.26	because of the teachings around the concept of idolatry,
872.26	you don't find as many
874.26	physical representations of divinity
876.26	or of spiritual liberation
878.26	as you do in the Buddhist tradition,
880.26	where, of course, there are many statues of the Buddha
883.26	that are highly revered.
888.26	So, we were talking about the differences
890.26	between the traditions
892.26	and what many people perceived
894.26	as the tragedy of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas,
897.26	but I offered the suggestion
899.26	that perhaps we could look at this in a positive way.
903.26	What we saw in the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas
910.26	was the depletion of matter,
913.26	some solid substance
915.26	falling down and disintegrating.
917.26	Maybe we could look at that to be more similar
919.26	to the falling of the Berlin Wall,
921.26	where a divide
923.26	that had kept two types of people apart
926.26	had collapsed and opened up a door
928.26	for further communication.
930.26	So I think that, in this way,
932.26	it's always possible for us
934.26	to derive something positive
937.26	that can help us understand one another better.
980.26	TD: So, with regard to the development
982.26	that we've been talking about
984.26	here at this conference,
986.26	I really feel
988.26	that the development that we make
991.26	shouldn't create a further burden
993.26	for us as human beings,
995.26	but should be used
997.26	to improve
1000.26	our fundamental lifestyle
1002.26	of how we live in the world.
1096.26	TD: Of course, I rejoice
1098.26	in the development and the growth and the rise
1101.26	of the noble land of India, the great country of India,
1104.26	but at the same time, I think,
1106.26	as some of us have acknowledged,
1109.26	we need to be aware
1111.26	that some aspects of this rise
1114.26	are coming at the cost
1117.26	of the very ground
1119.26	on which we stand.
1121.26	So, as we are climbing the tree,
1124.26	some of the things that we're doing
1126.26	in order to climb the tree
1128.26	are actually undermining
1130.26	the tree's very root.
1132.26	And so,
1134.26	what I think it comes down to
1136.26	is a question of, not only having information of what's going on,
1140.26	but paying attention to that
1143.26	and letting that shift our motivation
1146.26	to become more sincere
1149.26	and genuinely positive.
1153.26	We have hear, this week,
1155.26	about the horrible sufferings, for example,
1159.26	that so many women of the world
1162.26	are enduring day-to-day.
1164.26	We have that information,
1166.26	but what often happens to us
1168.26	is that we don't really choose to pay attention to it.
1171.26	We don't really choose to allow that
1173.26	to cause there to be a shift in our hearts.
1176.26	So I think the way forward for the world --
1178.26	one that will bring the path of outer development
1182.26	in harmony
1187.26	with the real root of happiness --
1190.26	is that we allow
1192.26	the information that we have
1194.26	to really make a change in our heart.
1245.26	TD: So I think that sincere motivation
1247.26	is very important for our future well-being,
1250.26	or deep sense of well-being as humans,
1253.26	and I think that means sinking in
1256.26	to whatever it is you're doing now.
1258.26	Whatever work you're trying to do now to benefit the world,
1260.26	sink into that,
1262.26	get a full taste of that.
1300.26	TD: So, since we've been here this week,
1302.26	we've taken millions of breaths, collectively,
1307.26	and perhaps we haven't witnessed
1309.26	any course changes
1311.26	happening in our lives,
1313.26	but we often miss the very subtle changes.
1316.26	And I think
1319.26	that sometimes we develop
1321.26	grand concepts
1323.26	of what happiness
1325.26	might look like for us,
1327.26	but that, if we pay attention,
1329.26	we can see that there are little symbols of happiness
1332.26	in every breath that we take.
1401.26	TD: So, every one of you who has come here
1404.26	is so talented,
1406.26	and you have so much to offer to the world,
1410.26	I think it would be a good note to conclude on then
1414.26	to just take a moment
1417.26	to appreciate how fortunate we are
1419.26	to have come together in this way and exchanged ideas
1422.26	and really form a strong aspiration
1424.26	and energy within ourselves
1426.26	that we will take the good
1428.26	that has come from this conference,
1430.26	the momentum, the positivity,
1433.26	and we will spread that and plant it
1435.26	in all of the corners of the world.
1458.26	His Holiness the Karmapa: Tomorrow is my Talk.
1472.26	TD: Lakshmi has worked incredibly hard,
1475.26	even in inviting me,
1477.26	let alone everything else that she has done
1479.26	to make this happen,
1481.26	and I was somewhat resistant at times,
1484.26	and I was also very nervous throughout this week.
1487.26	I was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth,
1490.26	and people would ask me, why.
1492.26	"I would tell them, ""It's because I have to talk tomorrow."""
1497.26	And so Lakshmi had to put up with me through all of that,
1500.26	but I very much appreciate
1502.26	the opportunity she's given me
1504.26	to be here.
1506.26	And to you, everyone, thank you very much.
1509.26	(Applause)
1512.26	HH: Thank you very much.
1514.26	(Applause)
