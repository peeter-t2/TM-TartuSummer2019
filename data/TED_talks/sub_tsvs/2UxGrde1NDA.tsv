12.632	I'd like to introduce you to an organism:
15.737	a slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.
19.193	It's a mold with an identity
19.193	crisis, because it's not a mold,
22.015	so let's get that straight to start with.
23.945	It is one of 700 known slime molds
26.481	belonging to the kingdom of the amoeba.
28.618	It is a single-celled organism, a cell,
31.241	that joins together with other cells
33.481	to form a mass super-cell
35.713	to maximize its resources.
37.953	So within a slime mold you might find thousands
40.113	or millions of nuclei,
42.36	all sharing a cell wall,
44.121	all operating as one entity.
47.229	In its natural habitat,
48.833	you might find the slime mold foraging in woodlands,
51.629	eating rotting vegetation,
55.33	but you might equally find it
56.87	in research laboratories,
58.412	classrooms, and even artists' studios.
62.614	I first came across the slime
62.614	mold about five years ago.
65.549	A microbiologist friend of mine
67.106	gave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it
70.23	and told me to go home and play with it.
73.238	The only instructions I was given,
75.245	that it likes it dark and damp
77.029	and its favorite food is porridge oats.
81.36	I'm an artist who's worked for many years
83.378	with biology, with scientific processes,
86.225	so living material is not uncommon for me.
89.236	I've worked with plants, bacteria,
91.341	cuttlefish, fruit flies.
92.86	So I was keen to get my new collaborator home
95.462	to see what it could do.
96.838	So I took it home and I watched.
100.04	I fed it a varied diet.
102.81	I observed as it networked.
104.734	It formed a connection between food sources.
107.01	I watched it leave a trail behind it,
109.848	indicating where it had been.
111.607	And I noticed that when it was
111.607	fed up with one petri dish,
114.555	it would escape and find a better home.
117.534	I captured my observations
119.262	through time-lapse photography.
121.022	Slime mold grows at about one centimeter an hour,
123.86	so it's not really ideal for live viewing
126.441	unless there's some form of
126.441	really extreme meditation,
129.294	but through the time lapse,
131.822	I could observe some really interesting behaviors.
134.918	For instance, having fed on a nice pile of oats,
138.418	the slime mold goes off to explore new territories
142.862	in different directions simultaneously.
145.594	When it meets itself,
147.833	it knows it's already there,
149.7	it recognizes it's there,
151.654	and instead retreats back
153.201	and grows in other directions.
156.881	I was quite impressed by this feat,
159.205	at how what was essentially
159.205	just a bag of cellular slime
162.755	could somehow map its territory,
165.985	know itself, and move with seeming intention.
169.457	I found countless scientific studies,
173.11	research papers, journal articles,
175.155	all citing incredible work with this one organism,
179.379	and I'm going to share a few of those with you.
181.343	For example, a team in Hokkaido University in Japan
184.303	filled a maze with slime mold.
186.335	It joined together and formed a mass cell.
188.431	They introduced food at two points,
190.783	oats of course,
191.981	and it formed a connection
193.627	between the food.
195.041	It retracted from empty areas and dead ends.
197.525	There are four possible routes through this maze,
200.335	yet time and time again,
202.44	the slime mold established the shortest
204.607	and the most efficient route.
207.06	Quite clever.
208.311	The conclusion from their experiment
210.05	was that the slime mold had
210.05	a primitive form of intelligence.
213.047	Another study exposed cold air at
213.047	regular intervals to the slime mold.
216.91	It didn't like it. It doesn't like it cold.
219.255	It doesn't like it dry.
220.448	They did this at repeat intervals,
222.563	and each time, the slime mold
224.221	slowed down its growth in response.
227.351	However, at the next interval,
229.195	the researchers didn't put the cold air on,
232.019	yet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation
235.313	of it happening.
236.649	It somehow knew that it was about the time
239.175	for the cold air that it didn't like.
241.131	The conclusion from their experiment
242.82	was that the slime mold was able to learn.
246.09	A third experiment:
247.321	the slime mold was invited
249.088	to explore a territory covered in oats.
253.28	It fans out in a branching pattern.
256.327	As it goes, each food node it finds,
258.975	it forms a network, a connection to,
261.675	and keeps foraging.
263.423	After 26 hours, it established
265.864	quite a firm network
267.481	between the different oats.
269.271	Now there's nothing remarkable in this
271.091	until you learn that the center oat that it started from
273.503	represents the city of Tokyo,
275.517	and the surrounding oats are
275.517	suburban railway stations.
279.583	The slime mold had replicated
282.064	the Tokyo transport network
284.48	— (Laughter) —
286.135	a complex system developed over time
289.13	by community dwellings, civil
289.13	engineering, urban planning.
293.03	What had taken us well over 100 years
295.303	took the slime mold just over a day.
298.469	The conclusion from their experiment
300.122	was that the slime mold can form efficient networks
302.632	and solve the traveling salesman problem.
305.255	It is a biological computer.
307.519	As such, it has been mathematically modeled,
310.143	algorithmically analyzed.
311.804	It's been sonified, replicated, simulated.
314.509	World over, teams of researchers
317.479	are decoding its biological principles
320.449	to understand its computational rules
322.59	and applying that learning
322.59	to the fields of electronics,
324.844	programming and robotics.
327.08	So the question is,
329.234	how does this thing work?
331.254	It doesn't have a central nervous system.
333.414	It doesn't have a brain,
335.112	yet it can perform behaviors
336.94	that we associate with brain function.
338.928	It can learn, it can remember,
340.836	it can solve problems, it can make decisions.
343.593	So where does that intelligence lie?
346.308	So this is a microscopy, a video I shot,
348.8	and it's about 100 times magnification,
351.453	sped up about 20 times,
354.32	and inside the slime mold,
356.106	there is a rhythmic pulsing flow,
359.548	a vein-like structure carrying
361.716	cellular material, nutrients and chemical information
365.488	through the cell,
367.346	streaming first in one direction
367.346	and then back in another.
370.964	And it is this continuous, synchronous oscillation
374.781	within the cell that allows it to form
377.037	quite a complex understanding of its environment,
380.019	but without any large-scale control center.
383.388	This is where its intelligence lies.
385.969	So it's not just academic researchers
389.213	in universities that are interested in this organism.
391.857	A few years ago, I set up SliMoCo,
394.73	the Slime Mould Collective.
397.07	It's an online, open, democratic network
400.293	for slime mold researchers and enthusiasts
402.389	to share knowledge and experimentation
405.118	across disciplinary divides
408.086	and across academic divides.
411.781	The Slime Mould Collective
411.781	membership is self-selecting.
415.221	People have found the collective
418.017	as the slime mold finds the oats.
421.715	And it comprises of scientists
423.408	and computer scientists and researchers
424.967	but also artists like me,
427.254	architects, designers, writers, activists, you name it.
432.346	It's a very interesting, eclectic membership.
436.529	Just a few examples:
437.866	an artist who paints with fluorescent Physarum;
440.991	a collaborative team
442.563	who are combining biological and electronic design
446.341	with 3D printing technologies in a workshop;
449.486	another artist who is using the slime mold
451.62	as a way of engaging a community
453.72	to map their area.
456.724	Here, the slime mold is being used directly
458.886	as a biological tool, but metaphorically
461.764	as a symbol for ways of talking
463.748	about social cohesion, communication
467.602	and cooperation.
469.466	Other public engagement activities,
471.976	I run lots of slime mold workshops,
473.994	a creative way of engaging with the organism.
476.456	So people are invited to come and learn
478.14	about what amazing things it can do,
480.036	and they design their own petri dish experiment,
482.682	an environment for the slime mold to navigate
484.998	so they can test its properties.
486.636	Everybody takes home a new pet
489.08	and is invited to post their results
492.02	on the Slime Mould Collective.
494.438	And the collective has enabled me
495.886	to form collaborations
498.248	with a whole array of interesting people.
500.841	I've been working with filmmakers
502.434	on a feature-length slime mold documentary,
505.9	and I stress feature-length,
508.558	which is in the final stages of edit
510.267	and will be hitting your cinema screens very soon.
513.293	(Laughter)
514.773	It's also enabled me to conduct what I think is
518.108	the world's first human slime mold experiment.
520.981	This is part of an exhibition in Rotterdam last year.
523.953	We invited people to become
523.953	slime mold for half an hour.
528.644	So we essentially tied people together
531.985	so they were a giant cell,
534.309	and invited them to follow slime mold rules.
537.153	You have to communicate through oscillations,
540.584	no speaking.
541.88	You have to operate as one entity, one mass cell,
546.813	no egos,
548.397	and the motivation for moving
550.982	and then exploring the environment
552.89	is in search of food.
554.789	So a chaotic shuffle ensued
554.789	as this bunch of strangers
558.42	tied together with yellow ropes
558.42	"wearing ""Being Slime Mold"" t-shirts"
562.328	wandered through the museum park.
565.284	When they met trees, they had to reshape
568.61	their connections and reform as a mass cell
571.742	through not speaking.
575.729	This is a ludicrous experiment in many, many ways.
579.087	This isn't hypothesis-driven.
581.036	We're not trying to prove, demonstrate anything.
583.479	But what it did provide us was a way
585.613	of engaging a broad section of the public
587.961	with ideas of intelligence, agency, autonomy,
592.392	and provide a playful platform
594.721	for discussions about
598.453	the things that ensued.
600.837	One of the most exciting things
603.17	about this experiment
606.03	was the conversation that happened afterwards.
608.217	An entirely spontaneous symposium
608.217	happened in the park.
612.04	People talked about the human psychology,
614.069	of how difficult it was to let go
615.726	of their individual personalities and egos.
619.035	Other people talked about bacterial communication.
622.218	Each person brought in their own
624.197	individual interpretation,
627.054	and our conclusion from this experiment was that
628.959	the people of Rotterdam were highly cooperative,
632.865	especially when given beer.
635.661	We didn't just give them oats.
637.627	We gave them beer as well.
639.189	But they weren't as efficient as the slime mold,
641.383	and the slime mold, for me,
643.367	is a fascinating subject matter.
645.736	It's biologically fascinating,
647.593	it's computationally interesting,
649.177	but it's also a symbol,
651.251	a way of engaging with ideas of community,
654.909	collective behavior, cooperation.
658.563	A lot of my work draws on the scientific research,
660.689	so this pays homage to the maze experiment
663.873	but in a different way.
665.455	And the slime mold is also my working material.
667.813	It's a coproducer of photographs, prints, animations,
673.03	participatory events.
674.629	Whilst the slime mold doesn't choose
676.977	to work with me, exactly,
678.883	it is a collaboration of sorts.
681.485	I can predict certain behaviors
683.577	by understanding how it operates,
685.633	but I can't control it.
687.363	The slime mold has the final say
688.947	in the creative process.
691.078	And after all, it has its own internal aesthetics.
694.567	These branching patterns that we see
696.371	we see across all forms, scales of nature,
698.921	from river deltas to lightning strikes,
701.721	from our own blood vessels to neural networks.
705.757	There's clearly significant rules at play
708.22	in this simple yet complex organism,
710.485	and no matter what our disciplinary
710.485	perspective or our mode of inquiry,
714.277	there's a great deal that we can learn
716.06	from observing and engaging
717.829	with this beautiful, brainless blob.
720.95	I give you Physarum polycephalum.
724.165	Thank you.
725.918	(Applause)
