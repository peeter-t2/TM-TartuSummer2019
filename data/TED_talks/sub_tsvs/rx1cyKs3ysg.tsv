13.522	So, I'm going to start off with kind of the buzzkill a little bit.
17.5	Forty-two million people
19.631	were displaced by natural disasters in 2010.
22.741	Now, there was nothing particularly special about 2010,
25.812	because, on average, 31 and a half million people
29.108	are displaced by natural disasters every single year.
32.211	Now, usually when people hear statistics or stats like that,
34.759	you start thinking about places like Haiti or other kind of
37.553	exotic or maybe even impoverished areas, but it happens
40.973	right here in the United States every single year.
44.096	Last year alone, 99 federally declared disasters
47.111	were on file with FEMA,
49.357	from Joplin, Missouri, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama,
52.548	to the Central Texas wildfires that just happened recently.
56.939	Now, how does the most powerful country in the world
59.004	handle these displaced people?
61.103	They cram them onto cots, put all your personal belongings
63.532	in a plastic garbage bag, stick it underneath,
65.7	and put you on the floor of an entire sports arena,
68.715	or a gymnasium.
72.226	So obviously there's a massive housing gap,
75.288	and this really upset me, because academia tells you
78.196	after a major disaster, there's typically about
80.485	an 18-month time frame to -- we kinda recover,
83.824	start the recovery process,
85.401	but what most people don't realize is that on average
87.766	it takes 45 to 60 days or more
90.83	for the infamous FEMA trailers to even begin to show up.
93.692	Before that time, people are left to their own devices.
97.31	So I became obsessed with trying to figure out a way
100.686	to actually fill this gap.
102.836	This actually became my creative obsession.
105.39	I put aside all my freelance work after hours and started
108.095	just focusing particularly on this problem.
113.837	So I started sketching.
115.196	Two days after Katrina, I started sketching and sketching
117.22	and trying to brainstorm up ideas or solutions for this,
119.068	and as things started to congeal or ideas started to form,
122.226	I started sketching digitally on the computer,
124.452	but it was an obsession, so I couldn't just stop there.
127.921	I started experimenting, making models,
130.06	talking to experts in the field, taking their feedback,
132.838	and refining, and I kept on refining and refining
135.749	for nights and weekends for over five years.
138.805	Now, my obsession ended up driving me to create
142.29	full-size prototypes in my own backyard — (Laughter) —
144.575	and actually spending my own personal savings on
146.941	everything from tooling to patents
149.19	and a variety of other costs,
151.806	but in the end I ended up with this modular housing system
154.67	that can react to any situation or disaster.
157.332	It can be put up in any environment,
160.431	from an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields,
164.374	because it doesn't require any special setup
166.377	or specialty tools.
168.559	Now, at the foundation and kind of the core
170.279	of this whole system is the Exo Housing Unit,
173.213	which is just the individual shelter module.
175.646	And though it's light, light enough that you can actually
177.378	lift it by hand and move it around,
179.534	and it actually sleeps four people.
183.237	And you can arrange these things as kind of more
185.901	for encampments and more of a city grid type layout,
188.676	or you can circle the wagons, essentially,
190.571	and form these circular pods out of them,
192.582	which give you this semi-private communal area
195.038	for people to actually spill out into so they're not actually
197.807	trapped inside these units.
199.906	Now this fundamentally changes
202.331	the way we respond to disasters,
204.489	because gone are the horrid conditions
206.467	inside a sports arena or a gymnasium, where people
209.192	are crammed on these cots inside.
211.204	Now we have instant neighborhoods outside.
216.791	So the Exo is designed to be simply, basically
219.766	like a coffee cup. They can actually stack together
222.008	so we get extremely efficient transportation
224.933	and storage out of them.
227.184	In fact, 15 Exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself.
231.82	This means the Exo can actually be transported and set up
234.994	faster than any other housing option available today.
239.978	But I'm obsessive, so I couldn't just stop there,
241.967	so I actually started modifying the bunks where you could
243.856	actually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving,
246.164	so the same unit can now be used
247.676	for an office or storage location.
250.901	The doors can actually swap out, so you can actually put on
254.619	a rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control,
257.488	or a connector module that would allow you to actually
259.954	connect multiple units together, which gives you
262.339	larger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces,
266.005	so now this same kit of parts, this same unit
268.317	can actually serve as a living room, bedroom or bathroom,
272.96	or an office, a living space and secure storage.
279.067	Sounds like a great idea, but how do you make it real?
282.134	So the first idea I had, initially, was just
284.138	to go the federal and state governments and go,
285.994	"""Here, take it, for free."""
288.657	"But I was quickly told that, ""Boy, our government"
290.64	"doesn't really work like that."" (Laughter)"
292.898	Okay. Okay. So maybe I would start a nonprofit
296.883	to kind of help consult and get this idea going
299.726	along with the government, but then I was told,
301.829	"""Son, our government looks to private sector"
304.304	"for things like this."""
305.901	Okay. So maybe I would take this whole idea and go
308.891	to private corporations that would have this mutually shared
311.311	benefit to it, but I was quickly told by some corporations
314.214	that my personal passion project was not a brand fit
318.495	because they didn't want their logos stamped
321.073	across the ghettos of Haiti.
323.497	Now, I wasn't just obsessed. I was outraged. (Laughter.)
329.433	So I decided, kind of told myself,
333.85	"""Oh yeah? Watch this. I'll do it myself."" (Laughter)"
339.725	Now, this quickly, my day job sent me to work out of
341.905	our Milan office for a few months, so I was like,
345.059	what will I do? So I actually scheduled sleep on my calendar,
347.796	and spent the 8-hour time difference on conference calls
350.996	with material suppliers, manufacturers and potential customers.
355.016	And we found through this whole process, we found
356.47	this great little manufacturer in Virginia,
358.844	and if his body language is any indication,
360.997	that's the owner — (Laughter) — of what it's like
363.076	for a manufacturer to work directly with a designer,
365.169	you've got to see what happens here. (Laughter)
368.372	But G.S. Industries was fantastic.
370.628	They actually built three prototypes for us by hand.
375.008	So now we have prototypes that can show that four people
378.155	can actually sleep securely and much more comfortably
380.571	than a tent could ever provide.
385.068	And they actually shipped them here to Texas for us.
386.818	Now, a funny thing started happening.
388.271	Other people started to believe in what we were doing,
390.739	and actually offered us hangar space, donated hangar
392.656	space to us. And then the Georgetown Airport Authority
394.94	was bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed.
399.046	So now we had a hangar space to work in,
400.707	and prototypes to demo with.
403.789	So in one year, we've negotiated manufacturing agreements,
407.356	been awarded one patent, filed our second patent,
410.017	talked to multiple people, demoed this to FEMA
412.7	and its consultants to rave reviews,
414.948	and then started talking to some other people who requested
417.131	information, this little group called the United Nations.
419.622	And on top of that, now we have
421.727	a whole plethora of other individuals that have come up
424.371	and started to talk to us from doing it for mining camps,
427.862	mobile youth hostels, right down to the World Cup
430.294	and the Olympics.
432.879	So, in closing, on this whole thing here
439.971	is hopefully very soon we will not have to
444.627	respond to these painful phone calls that we get
446.548	after disasters where we don't really have anything
448.544	to sell or give you yet.
450.932	Hopefully very soon we will be there,
453.364	because we are destined,
455.571	obsessed with making it real.
459.677	Thank you. (Applause)
