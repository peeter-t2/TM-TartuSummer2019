25	I got a visit almost exactly a year ago,
29	a little over a year ago, from a very senior person at the Department of Defense.
33	"Came to see me and said, ""1,600 of the kids that we've sent out"
38	have come back missing at least one full arm.
43	Whole arm. Shoulder disarticulation.
46	And we're doing the same thing we did for -- more or less,
49	that we've done since the Civil War, a stick and a hook.
52	"And they deserve more than that."""
56	And literally, this guy sat in my office in New Hampshire and said,
60	"""I want you to give me something that we can put on these kids"
63	that'll pick up a raisin or a grape off a table,
68	they'll be able to put it in their mouth without destroying either one,
72	"and they'll be able to know the difference without looking at it."""
75	You know, had efferent, afferent, and haptic response.
80	He finishes explaining that, and I'm waiting for the big 300 pound paper proposal,
85	"and he said, ""That's what I want from you."""
88	"I said, ""Look, you're nuts. That technology's just not available right now."
95	And it can't be done.
97	Not in an envelope of a human arm,
100	"with 21 degrees of freedom, from your shoulder to your fingertips."""
105	"He said, ""About two dozen of these 1,600 kids have come back bilateral."
113	You think it's bad to lose one arm?
114	"That's an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone."""
122	I got a day job,
124	and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like,
126	let's supply water to the world, and power to the world, and educate all the kids,
131	which, Chris, I will not talk about. I don't need another mission.
139	I keep thinking about these kids with no arms.
143	"He says to me, ""We've done some work around the country."
146	"We've got some pretty amazing neurology and other people."""
150	"I said, ""I'll take a field trip, I'll go see what you got."""
154	Over the next month I visited lots of places, some out here, around the country,
157	found the best of the best.
159	I went down to Washington. I saw these guys, and said,
162	"""I did what you asked me. I looked at what's out there."
165	"I still think you're nuts. But not as nuts as I thought."""
170	I put a team together, a little over 13 months ago,
174	got up to 20 some-odd people.
177	We said, we're going to build a device that does what he wants.
180	We have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom;
183	you don't need the ones in the last two fingers.
185	We put this thing together.
187	A couple of weeks ago we took it down to Walter Reed,
190	which is unfortunately more in the news these days.
192	We showed it to a bunch of guys.
194	One guy who described himself as being lucky,
196	because he lost his left arm, and he's a righty.
202	He sat at a table with seven or eight of these other guys.
204	Said he was lucky, because he had his good arm,
207	and then he pushed himself back from the table. He had no legs.
211	These kids have attitudes that you just can't believe.
214	So I'm going to show you now, without the skin on it,
216	a 30-second piece, and then I'm done.
219	But understand what you're looking at
222	we made small enough to fit on a 50th percentile female,
226	so that we could put it in any of these people.
230	It's going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and
233	MRIs of whatever is their good arm,
235	to make silicon rubber, then coat it, and paint it in 3D --
241	exact mirror image of their other limb.
244	So, you won't see all the really cool stuff that's in this series elastic set of 14 actuators,
249	each one which has its own capability to sense temperature and pressure.
253	It also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on,
255	so the more they put themselves under load, the more it attaches.
259	They take the load off, and it becomes, again, compliant.
262	I'm going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this
266	that we demonstrated in Washington. Can we look at this thing?
276	Watch the fingers grab. The thumb comes up. Wrist.
282	This weighs 6.9 pounds.
285	Going to scratch his nose.
290	It's got 14 active degrees of freedom.
292	Now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger.
298	Now he's going to put that down, pick up a piece of paper,
301	rotate all the degrees of freedom in his hand and wrist, and read it.
310	(Applause)
