16.41	My name's Seth Priebatsch.
16.41	I'm the chief ninja of SCVNGR.
19.118	I'm a proud Princeton dropout.
20.61	Also proud to have relocated
20.61	here to Boston,
22.688	where I actually grew up.
24.259	(Applause) Yeah, Boston.
26.063	Easy wins, I should just name
26.063	the counties that we've got around here.
29.389	I'm also fairly determined
29.389	to try and build
31.604	a game layer on top of the world.
33.217	This is sort of a new concept
33.217	and it's really important,
35.901	because while the last decade
35.901	was the decade of social,
39.022	the decade where the framework in which
39.022	we connect with other people was built,
42.827	this next decade will be the decade
42.827	where the game framework is built,
47.174	where the motivations we use
47.174	to actually influence behavior
50.126	and the framework
50.126	in which that is constructed,
52.365	is decided upon,
52.365	and that's really important.
54.508	I say I want to build a game layer
54.508	on top of the world,
57.111	but that's not quite true,
58.386	because it's already under construction;
58.386	it's already happening.
61.56	And it looks like this right now.
63.444	It looks like the Web did
63.444	back in 1997, right?
66.26	It's not very good. It's cluttered.
68.21	It's filled with lots of different things
68.21	that, in short, aren't that fun.
72.124	There are credit card schemes
72.124	and airline mile programs,
75.392	coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes
78.056	that actually do use game dynamics
78.056	and are building the game layer --
81.941	they just suck.
83.26	They're not very well-designed.
85.349	(Laughter)
86.417	So that's unfortunate.
87.985	But luckily, as my favorite action
87.985	hero, Bob the Builder, says,
92.167	"""We can do better."
92.167	"We can build this better."""
94.769	And the tools, the resources
94.769	that we use to build a game layer,
98.26	are game dynamics themselves.
100.093	And so the crux of this presentation
100.093	is going to go through
102.886	four really important game dynamics,
104.648	really interesting things,
104.648	that, if you use consciously,
107.457	you can use to influence behavior,
110.26	both for good, for bad, for in-between.
112.641	Hopefully for good.
113.964	But this is the important stage
113.964	in which that framework will get built,
117.988	and so we want to all be thinking
117.988	about it consciously now.
121.109	Before we jump into that,
121.109	there's a question of:
123.39	Why is this important?
124.565	I'm making this claim
125.743	that there's a game layer
125.743	on top of the world,
127.917	and it's very important
127.917	that we build it properly.
130.279	The reason it's so important
130.279	is that, in the last decade,
132.973	what we've seen has been
132.973	building the social layer,
135.883	has been this framework for connections,
138.375	and construction on that layer
138.375	is over, it's finished.
141.963	There's still a lot to explore,
143.465	still a lot of people
143.465	trying to figure out social
145.78	and how we leverage this
145.78	and how we use this,
147.906	but the framework itself is done,
149.713	and it's called Facebook.
152.175	And that's OK, right? A lot of people
152.175	are very happy with Facebook.
155.57	I like it quite a lot.
157.183	They've created this thing
157.183	called the Open Graph,
159.51	and they own all of our connections.
161.26	They own half a billion people.
162.891	So when you want to build
162.891	on the social layer,
165.099	the framework has been decided;
165.099	it is the Open Graph API.
168.335	And if you're happy with that, fantastic.
170.369	If you're not, too bad.
170.369	There's nothing you can do.
173.547	And that's a real thing.
176.26	I mean, we want to build frameworks
176.26	in a way that makes it acceptable
181.26	and makes it productive down the road.
183.371	So, the social layer
183.371	is all about these connections.
186.495	The game layer is all about influence.
188.931	It's not about adding
188.931	a social fabric to the web
191.199	and connecting you to other people
192.85	everywhere you are and everywhere you go,
194.828	it's actually about using
194.828	dynamics, using forces,
197.148	to influence the behavior
197.148	of where you are, what you do there,
200.3	how you do it.
201.477	That's really, really powerful.
202.995	And it's going to be more important
202.995	than the social layer,
205.751	and affect our lives more deeply
205.751	and perhaps more invisibly.
208.67	So it's incredibly critical
208.67	that at this moment,
211.492	while it's just getting constructed,
213.236	while the frameworks
213.236	like Facebook or Open Graph
215.566	are being created
215.566	for the game-layer equivalent,
217.86	that we think about it very consciously,
219.808	and that we do it in a way
219.808	that is open, available,
222.22	and can be leveraged for good.
223.733	So that's what I want to talk
223.733	about for game dynamics,
226.287	because construction has just begun,
228.034	and the more consciously
228.034	we can think about this,
230.407	the better we'll be able to use it
230.407	for anything we want.
233.495	So like I said, the way you go
233.495	through and build on the game layer
236.665	is not with glass and steel and cement.
239.816	And the resources we use are not
239.816	this two-dimensional swath of land
243.051	that we have.
244.231	The resources are mindshare,
245.604	and the tools, the raw materials,
245.604	are these game dynamics.
248.412	With that, a couple
248.412	game dynamics to talk about.
251.137	Back at SCVNGR, we like to joke
252.686	that with seven game dynamics,
252.686	you can get anyone to do anything.
255.782	Today, I'm going to show you four,
257.444	because I hope to have a competitive
257.444	advantage at the end of this, still.
260.946	(Laughter)
263.101	So the first one,
263.101	it's a very simple game dynamic.
265.637	It's called the appointment dynamic.
267.453	It's a dynamic in which to succeed,
269.284	players have to do something
269.284	at a predefined time,
271.689	generally at a predefined place.
273.395	And these dynamics
273.395	are a little scary sometimes,
275.695	"because you think, ""Other people"
275.695	can be using forces
278.459	that will manipulate how I interact:
280.359	"what I do, where I do it, when I do it."""
282.36	"This sort of ""loss of free will"""
282.36	that occurs in games
284.872	can be frightening.
286.135	So with each dynamic,
286.135	I'm going to give three examples:
288.744	one that shows how it's already
288.744	being used in the real world,
291.634	so you can rationalize it a bit;
293.284	one that shows it in what we consider
293.284	a conventional game --
296.126	I think everything is a game,
297.542	but this is more what you'd think
297.542	of as a game played on a board
300.581	or on a computer screen;
301.758	and one of how it can be used for good,
303.649	so you can see that these forces
303.649	can be very powerful.
306.231	So the first one, the most famous
306.231	appointment dynamic in the world,
309.438	"is something called, ""Happy Hour."""
311.656	So I had just recently
311.656	dropped out of Princeton
314.162	and actually ended up
314.162	for the first time in a bar,
316.679	and I saw these happy hour things
316.679	all over the place.
319.473	And this is simply an appointment dynamic:
319.473	come here at a certain time,
322.901	get your drinks half off.
324.123	To win, all you have to do is show up
324.123	at the right place at the right time.
327.691	This game dynamic is so powerful,
329.33	it doesn't just influence our behavior;
329.33	it's influenced our entire culture.
332.914	That's a really scary thought,
334.374	that one game dynamic
334.374	can change things so powerfully.
337.135	It also exists in more
337.135	conventional game forms.
339.354	I'm sure you've all heard
339.354	of Farmville by now.
341.529	If you haven't, I recommend playing it.
343.439	You won't do anything else
343.439	for the rest of your day.
345.932	Farmville has more active
345.932	users than Twitter.
348.084	It's incredibly powerful,
349.315	and it has this dynamic
349.315	where you have to return at a certain time
352.456	to water your fake crops, or they wilt.
355.416	And this is so powerful
355.416	that when they tweak their stats,
358.652	when they say your crops wilt
360.485	after eight hours, or after six hours,
360.485	or after 24 hours,
363.26	it changes the life cycle
363.26	of some 70 million people during the day.
367.851	They will return, like clockwork,
367.851	at different times.
370.493	So if they wanted the world to end,
370.493	if they wanted productivity to stop,
373.907	they could make it a 30-minute cycle,
375.701	and no one could do anything else, right?
377.719	(Laughter)
379.259	That's a little scary.
380.751	But this could also be used for good.
383.037	This local company called Vitality
384.839	has created a product to help people
384.839	take their medicine on time.
387.998	That's an appointment.
389.175	It's something that people
389.175	don't do very well.
391.374	They have these GlowCaps
391.374	which flash and email you
393.794	and do cool things to remind you
393.794	to take your medicine.
396.421	This isn't a game yet,
396.421	but really should be.
398.591	You should get points for doing it on time
400.673	and lose points for not doing it on time.
402.663	They should recognize they've built
402.663	an appointment dynamic,
405.458	and leverage the games.
406.633	Then you can really achieve good
406.633	in some interesting ways.
409.424	We're going to jump onto the next one.
411.97	Influence and status.
413.259	This is one of the most famous
413.259	game dynamics, used all over the place.
417.26	It's used in your wallets, right now.
419.389	We all want that credit card
419.389	on the far left, because it's black.
423.26	And you see someone at CVS or --
425.125	not CVS -- like, Christian Dior --
426.816	(Laughter)
428.86	I don't know. I don't have a black
428.86	card; I've got a debit card.
432.152	(Laughter)
433.961	So they whip it out and you see
433.961	that black card, and:
436.588	"""I want that because it means"
436.588	they're cooler than I am,
439.199	"and I need that."""
440.374	And this is used in games as well.
442.088	"""Modern Warfare,"" one of the most"
442.088	successful selling games of all time.
445.485	I'm only a level four, but I desperately
445.485	want to be a level 10,
448.51	because they've got that cool red badge,
450.451	and that means that I am somehow
450.451	better than everyone else.
453.26	And that's very powerful to me.
454.85	Status is really good motivator.
456.983	It's also used in more
456.983	conventional settings,
459.147	and can be used more consciously there.
461.052	School -- and remember,
461.052	I made it through one year,
464.029	so I think I'm qualified
464.029	to talk on school --
466.67	is a game; it's just not a terribly
466.67	well-designed game.
469.797	There are levels. There are C.
469.797	There are B. There's A.
472.355	There are statuses. I mean,
472.355	what is valedictorian, but a status?
475.447	If we called valedictorian
475.447	"a ""White Knight Paladin level 20,"""
479.851	I think people would probably
479.851	work a lot harder.
482.132	(Laughter)
484.156	(Applause)
485.93	So school is a game,
487.62	and there has been lots of experimentation
487.62	on how we do this properly.
490.959	But let's use it consciously.
492.372	Why have games you can lose?
492.372	Why go from an A to an F or a B to a C?
495.649	That sucks. Why not level-up?
497.196	At Princeton, they've actually
497.196	experimented with this,
499.775	with quizzes where
499.775	you gain experience points,
501.966	and you level up from B to an A.
503.721	And it's very powerful.
505.26	It can be used in interesting ways.
508.172	The third one I'll talk about
508.172	is the progression dynamic,
510.91	where you have to make progress,
510.91	move through different steps
513.841	in a very granular fashion.
515.523	This is used all over the place,
515.523	including LinkedIn,
518.26	where I am an unwhole individual.
520.578	I am only 85 percent complete on LinkedIn,
523.882	and that bothers me.
525.26	And this is so deep-seated in our psyche
528.359	that when we're presented
528.359	with a progress bar
530.506	and presented with easy,
530.506	granular steps to take
533.07	to try and complete
533.07	that progress bar, we will do it.
535.681	We will find a way to move that blue line
537.675	all the way to the right edge
537.675	of the screen.
540.172	This is used in conventional
540.172	games as well.
542.332	I mean, this is a Paladin level 10,
544.549	and that's a Paladin level 20.
546.177	And if you were going to fight
546.177	Orcs on the fields of Mordor
549.766	against the Ra's Al Ghul,
551.26	you'd probably want to be
551.26	the bigger one, right?
553.57	I would.
555.261	And so people work very hard to level-up.
557.796	"""World of Warcraft"" is one"
557.796	of the most successful games of all time.
561.05	The average player spends some six,
561.05	six-and-a-half hours a day on it,
564.702	their most dedicated players --
564.702	it's like a full-time job, it's insane.
568.324	And they have these systems
568.324	where you can level-up.
570.79	And that's a very powerful thing.
570.79	Progression is powerful.
574.121	It can also be used
574.121	in very compelling ways for good.
577.16	One of the things we work on at SCVNGR is:
579.206	How do you use games to drive traffic
579.206	and business to local businesses,
582.638	to something that is very key
582.638	to the economy?
584.808	And here, we have a game that people play.
587.126	They go places,
587.126	do challenges, earn points.
589.174	And we've introduced
589.174	a progression dynamic into it,
591.782	where, by going to the same place
591.782	over and over, doing challenges,
594.914	engaging with the business,
596.232	you move a green bar from the left edge
596.232	of the screen to the right,
599.418	and unlock rewards.
600.596	This is powerful enough that we can see
600.596	it hooks people into these dynamics,
604.536	pulls them back to the same
604.536	local businesses,
606.658	creates loyalty, creates engagement,
608.416	and is able to drive meaningful revenue
608.416	and fun and engagement to businesses.
612.367	These progression dynamics are powerful
612.367	and can be used in the real world.
616.26	The final one I want to talk about --
616.26	and it's a great one to end on --
619.637	is this concept of communal discovery,
621.518	a dynamic in which everyone
621.518	has to work together to achieve something.
625.8	Communal discovery is powerful
627.65	because it leverages
627.65	the network that is society
630.69	to solve problems.
633.071	This is used in some famous
633.071	consumer web stories like Digg,
636.873	which I'm sure you've all heard of.
638.582	Digg is a communal dynamic
640.26	to try to find and source the best news,
640.26	the most interesting stories.
644.26	And they made this into a game, initially.
646.284	They had a leader board where,
646.284	if you recommended the best stories,
649.472	you would get points.
650.848	And that really motivated people
650.848	to find the best stories.
653.624	But it became so powerful,
653.624	there was actually a cabal,
656.26	a group of people, the top seven
656.26	on the leader board,
659.683	who would work together to make sure
659.683	they maintained that position,
662.886	recommending people's stories.
664.355	The game became
664.355	more powerful than the goal.
666.592	They ended up shutting down the leader
666.592	board because, while it was effective,
670.26	it was so powerful that it stopped
670.26	sourcing the best stories,
673.188	and started having people work
673.188	to maintain leadership.
675.759	So we have to use this one carefully.
677.55	It's also used in things
677.55	like McDonald's Monopoly,
679.929	where the game is not
679.929	the Monopoly you're playing,
682.342	but the cottage industries
682.342	that form to try and find Boardwalk.
685.695	There, they're just looking
685.695	"for a sticker that says ""Boardwalk,"""
688.933	but it can also be used
688.933	to find real things.
691.015	This is the DARPA balloon challenge,
692.772	where they hid a couple balloons
692.772	all across the United States and said,
696.137	"""Use networks. Try and find"
696.137	these balloons fastest,
698.591	"and the winner will get $40,000."""
700.261	The winner was a group out of MIT,
702.132	where they created sort
702.132	of a pyramid scheme, a network,
704.752	where the first person to recommend
704.752	the location of a balloon got $2,000,
708.205	and anyone else to push
708.205	that recommendation up also got a cut.
711.16	And in 12 hours, they were able
711.16	to find all these balloons,
714.175	all across the country.
715.665	Really powerful dynamic.
717.413	And so, I've got about 20 seconds left,
720.26	so if I'm going to leave
720.26	you with anything,
722.332	last decade was the decade of social.
724.138	This next decade is the decade of games.
726.26	We use game dynamics to build on it.
726.26	We build with mindshare.
729.151	We can influence behavior.
730.42	It's very powerful. It's very exciting.
732.307	Let's all build it together,
732.307	let's do it well and have fun playing.
735.688	(Applause)
