13.071	I would like to share with you
13.071	a new model of higher education,
17.502	a model that, once expanded,
20.308	can enhance the collective intelligence
22.65	of millions of creative
22.65	and motivated individuals
27.143	that otherwise would be left behind.
30.25	Look at the world.
32.001	Pick a place and focus on it.
34.664	You will find humans
34.664	chasing higher education.
39.187	Let's meet some of them.
41.354	Patrick.
42.821	Patrick was born in Liberia
42.821	to a family of 20 children.
48.38	During the civil war,
50.004	he and his family were forced
50.004	to flee to Nigeria.
54.468	There, in spite of his situation,
57.23	he graduated high school
57.23	with nearly perfect grades.
61.389	He wanted to continue to higher education,
64.477	but due to his family
64.477	living on the poverty line,
67.761	he was soon sent to South Africa
70.292	to work and send back money
70.292	to feed his family.
75.036	Patrick never gave up his dream
75.036	of higher education.
78.892	Late at night, after work,
81.315	he surfed the net,
81.315	looking for ways to study.
85.827	Meet Debbie.
87.117	Debbie is from Florida.
89.897	Her parents didn't go to college,
89.897	and neither did any of her siblings.
94.706	Debbie has worked all her life,
98.013	pays taxes, supports herself
98.013	month to month,
101.847	proud of the American dream,
104.199	a dream that just won't be complete
104.199	without higher education.
108.87	But Debbie doesn't have the savings
108.87	for higher education.
112.613	She can't pay the tuition.
114.881	Neither could she leave work.
118.094	Meet Wael.
119.75	Wael is from Syria.
121.91	He's experiencing firsthand
125.528	the misery, fear and failure
125.528	imposed on his country.
130.755	He's a big believer in education.
133.33	He knew that if he could find
133.33	an opportunity for higher education,
137.387	an opportunity to get ahead of the rest,
140.206	he has a better chance to survive
140.206	in a world turned upside down.
146.057	The higher education system
149.495	failed Patrick, Debbie and Wael,
152.241	exactly as it is failing
152.241	millions of potential students --
157.21	millions that graduate high school,
160.187	millions that are qualified
160.187	for higher education,
163.599	millions that want to study
163.599	yet cannot access it for various reasons.
169.618	First: financial.
172.412	Universities are expensive;
172.412	we all know it.
175.331	In large parts of the world,
177.459	higher education is unattainable
177.459	for an average citizen.
182.258	This is probably the biggest problem
182.258	facing our society.
186.672	Higher education stopped
186.672	being a right for all
190.282	and became a privilege for the few.
193.971	Second: cultural.
198.061	Students who are qualified
198.061	for higher education
200.914	can afford -- want to study -- cannot,
204.97	because it is not decent,
204.97	it is not a place for a woman.
211.047	This is the story of countless women
211.047	in Africa, for example,
215.01	prevented from higher education
215.01	because of cultural barriers.
219.686	And here comes the third reason:
222.11	UNESCO stated that in 2025,
	of higher education,
231.614	simply because there will not be enough
231.614	seats to accommodate them,
236.608	to meet the demand.
238.363	They will take a placement test,
238.363	they will pass it,
241.556	but they still won't have access,
241.556	because there are no places available.
247.416	These are the reasons
247.416	I founded University of the People,
252.14	a nonprofit, tuition-free,
252.14	degree-granting university
257.047	to give an alternative,
258.858	to create an alternative,
258.858	to those who have no other;
262.376	an alternative that will be
262.376	affordable and scalable,
267.841	an alternative that will disrupt
267.841	the current education system,
273.725	and open the gates to higher education
273.725	for every qualified student
277.917	regardless of what they earn,
277.917	where they live,
282.553	or what society says about them.
285.449	Patrick, Debbie and Wael
287.445	are only three examples
287.445	out of the 1,700 accepted students
291.095	from 143 countries.
295.492	(Applause)
296.896	Thank you.
298.196	(Applause)
300.028	We didn't need to reinvent the wheel.
302.273	We just looked at what wasn't working
304.809	and used the amazing power of the Internet
307.572	to get around it.
309.386	We set out to build a model
312.928	that will cut down almost entirely
312.928	the cost of higher education.
317.927	And that's how we did it.
319.869	First, bricks and mortar cost money.
323.324	Universities have expenses
323.324	that virtual universities don't.
328.47	We don't need to pass these expenses
328.47	on to our students.
332.124	They don't exist.
333.528	We also don't need
333.528	to worry about capacity.
336.671	There are no limits of seats
336.671	in virtual university.
340.867	Actually, nobody needs to stand
340.867	at the back of the lecture hall.
345.228	Textbooks are also something
345.228	our students don't need to buy.
349.803	By using open educational resources
352.731	and the generosity of professors
355.211	who are putting their material up
355.211	free and accessible,
359.747	we don't need to send
359.747	our students to buy textbooks.
362.523	All of our materials come free.
365.635	Even professors,
367.265	the most expensive line
367.265	in any university balance sheet,
371.16	come free to our students.
372.84	Over 3,000 of them,
375.611	including presidents, vice chancellors,
375.611	professors and academic advisers
381.648	from top universities such as NYU,
381.648	Yale, Berkeley and Oxford,
387.224	came on board to help our students.
390.2	Finally, is our belief
390.2	in peer-to-peer learning.
394.394	We use this sound pedagogical model
397.624	to encourage our students
397.624	from all over the world
400.361	to interact and study together,
402.715	and also to reduce the time
402.715	our professors need
407.778	to labor over class assignments.
413.006	If the Internet has made us
413.006	a global village,
418.232	this model can develop
418.232	its future leadership.
422.378	Look how we do it.
424.251	We only offer two programs:
427.079	business administration
427.079	and computer science,
429.776	the two programs most in demand worldwide,
433.958	the two programs that are likeliest
433.958	to help our students find a job.
439.512	When our students are accepted,
442.274	they are placed in a small classroom
442.274	of 20 to 30 students,
448.161	to ensure that those who need
448.161	personalized attention get it.
452.827	Moreover, for every nine-week course,
452.827	they meet a new peer,
458.614	a whole new set of students
458.614	from all over the world.
462.129	Every week, when they go
462.129	into the classroom,
465.409	they find the lecture notes of the week,
468.166	the reading assignment,
468.166	the homework assignment,
470.454	and the discussion question,
470.454	which is the core of our studies.
474.405	Every week, every student must contribute
474.405	to the class discussion,
478.887	and also must comment
478.887	on the contribution of others.
483.109	This way, we open our students' minds,
486.631	we develop a positive shift in attitude
486.631	toward different cultures.
492.089	By the end of each week,
492.089	the students take a quiz,
495.854	hand in their homework,
497.201	which are assessed by their peers
497.201	under the supervision of the instructors,
502.292	get a grade, move to the next week.
504.566	By the end of the course,
504.566	they take the final exam,
507.236	get a grade, and follow
507.236	to the next course.
512.703	We open the gates for higher education
512.703	for every qualified student.
518.855	Every student with a high school diploma,
521.793	sufficient English and Internet connection
524.957	can study with us.
526.573	We don't use audio, we don't use video.
529.505	Broadband is not necessary.
531.889	Any student from any part of the world
531.889	with any Internet connection
536.492	can study with us.
538.798	We are tuition free.
541.202	All we ask our students to cover
541.202	is the cost of their exams,
547.396	A full-time bachelor's degree
547.396	student taking 40 courses
552.02	will pay 1,000 dollars a year,
554.867	4,000 dollars for the entire degree.
557.521	And for those who cannot afford even this,
561.121	we offer them a variety of scholarships.
563.895	It is our mission that nobody
563.895	will be left behind
566.973	for financial reasons.
569.058	With 5,000 students in 2016,
569.058	this model is financially sustainable.
577.352	Five years ago, it was a vision.
581.813	Today, it is a reality.
584.862	Last month, we got the ultimate
584.862	academic endorsement to our model.
590.325	University of the People
590.325	is now fully accredited.
594.743	(Applause)
596.029	Thank you.
597.277	(Applause)
601.386	With this accreditation,
601.386	it's our time now to scale up.
606.179	We have demonstrated that our model works.
610.404	I invite universities
610.404	and, even more important,
613.416	developing countries' governments,
615.109	to replicate this model
617.039	to ensure that the gates of higher
617.039	education will open widely.
622.49	A new era is coming --
624.45	an era that will witness the disruption
624.45	of the higher education model
629.767	as we know it today,
631.931	from being a privilege for the few
635.658	to becoming a basic right,
635.658	affordable and accessible for all.
641.779	Thank you.
643.122	(Applause)
