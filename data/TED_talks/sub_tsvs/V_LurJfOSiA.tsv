15.26	You should be nice
17.26	to nerds.
19.26	In fact, I'd go so far as to say,
21.26	if you don't already have a nerd in your life,
23.26	you should get one.
26.26	I'm just saying.
28.26	Scientists and engineers
30.26	change the world.
33.26	I'd like to tell you
35.26	about a magical place called DARPA
38.26	where scientists and engineers
40.26	defy the impossible
42.26	and refuse to fear failure.
45.26	Now these two ideas
47.26	are connected more than you may realize,
50.26	because when you remove the fear of failure,
54.26	impossible things
56.26	suddenly become possible.
60.26	If you want to know how,
62.26	ask yourself this question:
65.26	What would you attempt to do
67.26	if you knew you could not fail?
70.26	If you really ask yourself
72.26	this question,
74.26	you can't help but feel uncomfortable.
77.26	I feel a little uncomfortable.
80.26	Because when you ask it,
82.26	you begin to understand
84.26	how the fear of failure constrains you,
87.26	how it keeps us
89.26	from attempting great things,
92.26	and life gets dull,
95.26	amazing things stop happening.
98.26	Sure, good things happen,
100.26	but amazing things
102.26	stop happening.
104.26	Now I should be clear,
107.26	I'm not encouraging failure,
110.26	I'm discouraging
112.26	fear of failure.
115.26	Because it's not failure itself
117.26	that constrains us.
119.26	The path to truly new,
121.26	never-been-done-before things
123.26	always has failure along the way.
126.26	We're tested.
128.26	And in part, that testing feels an appropriate part
132.26	of achieving something great.
135.26	Clemenceau said,
137.26	"""Life gets interesting when we fail,"
140.26	because it's a sign
142.26	"that we've surpassed ourselves."""
145.26	In 1895,
147.26	Lord Kelvin declared
149.26	that heavier-than-air flying machines
151.26	were impossible.
153.26	In October of 1903,
155.26	the prevailing opinion
157.26	of expert aerodynamicists
160.26	was that maybe in 10 million years
162.26	we could build an aircraft that would fly.
165.26	And two months later on December 17th,
168.26	Orville Wright powered the first airplane
171.26	across a beach in North Carolina.
174.26	The flight lasted 12 seconds
177.26	and covered 120 feet.
180.26	That was 1903.
182.26	One year later,
184.26	the next declarations of impossibilities began.
187.26	Ferdinand Foch, a French army general
190.26	credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds
194.26	in the French army,
196.26	"said, ""Airplanes are interesting toys,"
199.26	"but of no military value."""
205.26	aero experts coined the term transonic.
208.26	They debated, should it have one S or two?
213.26	You see, they were having trouble in this flight regime,
216.26	and it wasn't at all clear
218.26	that we could fly faster than the speed of sound.
222.26	In 1947,
224.26	there was no wind tunnel data
226.26	beyond Mach 0.85.
231.26	And yet,
233.26	on Tuesday, October 14th, 1947,
238.26	Chuck Yeager climbed into the cockpit
241.26	of his Bell X-1
243.26	and he flew
245.26	towards an unknown possibility,
249.26	and in so doing,
251.26	he became the first pilot
253.26	to fly faster than the speed of sound.
262.26	Six of eight Atlas rockets
264.26	blew up on the pad.
266.26	After 11 complete mission failures,
268.26	we got our first images from space.
270.26	And on that first flight
272.26	we got more data
274.26	than in all U-2 missions combined.
279.26	It took a lot of failures
281.26	to get there.
283.26	Since we took to the sky,
285.26	we have wanted to fly
287.26	faster and farther.
290.26	And to do so,
292.26	we've had to believe in impossible things.
295.26	And we've had to refuse
297.26	to fear failure.
300.26	That's still true today.
303.26	Today, we don't talk about flying transonically,
307.26	or even supersonically,
310.26	we talk about flying hypersonically --
313.26	not Mach 2 or Mach 3, Mach 20.
317.26	At Mach 20,
319.26	we can fly from New York to Long Beach
321.26	in 11 minutes and 20 seconds.
324.26	At that speed,
326.26	the surface of the airfoil
328.26	is the temperature of molten steel --
330.26	3,500 degrees Fahrenheit --
333.26	like a blast furnace.
335.26	We are essentially burning the airfoil
338.26	as we fly it.
340.26	And we are flying it,
342.26	or trying to.
344.26	DARPA's hypersonic test vehicle
347.26	is the fastest maneuvering aircraft
349.26	ever built.
351.26	It's boosted to near-space
354.26	atop a Minotaur IV rocket.
356.26	Now the Minotaur IV has too much impulse,
358.26	so we have to bleed it off
360.26	by flying the rocket
362.26	at an 89 degree angle of attack
364.26	for portions of the trajectory.
367.26	That's an unnatural act
369.26	for a rocket.
371.26	The third stage has a camera.
374.26	We call it rocketcam.
376.26	And it's pointed
378.26	at the hypersonic glider.
381.26	This is the actual rocketcam footage
384.26	from flight one.
386.26	Now to conceal the shape, we changed the aspect ratio a little bit.
389.26	But this is what it looks like
392.26	from the third stage of the rocket
394.26	looking at the unmanned glider
396.26	as it heads into the atmosphere
399.26	back towards Earth.
401.26	We've flown twice.
403.26	In the first flight,
405.26	no aerodynamic control of the vehicle.
408.26	But we collected more hypersonic flight data
411.26	than in 30 years
413.26	of ground-based testing combined.
416.26	And in the second flight,
419.26	three minutes of fully-controlled,
422.26	aerodynamic flight
424.26	at Mach 20.
426.26	We must fly again,
428.26	because amazing, never-been-done-before things
432.26	require that you fly.
435.26	You can't learn to fly at Mach 20
438.26	unless you fly.
441.26	And while there's no substitute for speed,
444.26	maneuverability is a very close second.
448.26	If a Mach 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds
451.26	to get from New York to Long Beach,
453.26	a hummingbird would take,
455.26	well, days.
458.26	You see, hummingbirds are not hypersonic,
460.26	but they are maneuverable.
463.26	In fact, the hummingbird is the only bird
466.26	that can fly backwards.
468.26	It can fly up, down,
470.26	forwards, backwards,
472.26	even upside-down.
475.26	And so if we wanted to fly in this room
478.26	or places where humans can't go,
480.26	we'd need an aircraft
482.26	small enough and maneuverable enough
485.26	to do so.
487.26	This is a hummingbird drone.
490.26	It can fly in all directions,
492.26	even backwards.
494.26	It can hover and rotate.
497.26	This prototype aircraft
499.26	is equipped with a video camera.
502.26	It weighs less than one AA battery.
506.26	It does not eat nectar.
509.26	In 2008,
511.26	it flew for a whopping 20 seconds,
514.26	a year later, two minutes,
516.26	then six,
518.26	eventually 11.
520.26	Many prototypes crashed -- many.
524.26	But there's no way
526.26	to learn to fly like a hummingbird
528.26	unless you fly.
536.26	(Applause)
544.26	It's beautiful, isn't it.
548.26	Wow.
550.26	It's great.
555.26	Matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot.
558.26	(Applause)
565.26	Failure is part of creating
568.26	new and amazing things.
570.26	We cannot both fear failure
573.26	and make amazing new things --
577.26	like a robot
579.26	with the stability of a dog on rough terrain,
582.26	or maybe even ice;
584.26	a robot that can run like a cheetah,
586.26	or climb stairs like a human
589.26	with the occasional clumsiness of a human.
594.26	Or perhaps, Spider Man
597.26	will one day be Gecko Man.
600.26	A gecko can support
602.26	its entire body weight
604.26	with one toe.
606.26	One square millimeter of a gecko's footpad
609.26	has 14,000 hair-like structures
612.26	called setae.
614.26	They are used to help it grip to surfaces
617.26	using intermolecular forces.
620.26	Today we can manufacture structures
623.26	that mimic the hairs of a gecko's foot.
626.26	The result,
628.26	a four-by-four-inch
630.26	artificial nano-gecko adhesive.
634.26	can support a static load
636.26	of 660 pounds.
638.26	That's enough to stick
640.26	six 42-inch plasma TV's to your wall,
643.26	no nails.
645.26	So much for Velcro, right?
648.26	And it's not just passive structures,
651.26	it's entire machines.
654.26	This is a spider mite.
656.26	It's one millimeter long,
658.26	but it looks like Godzilla
660.26	next to these micromachines.
663.26	In the world of Godzilla spider mites,
666.26	we can make millions of mirrors,
669.26	each one-fifth the diameter
671.26	of a human hair,
673.26	moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second
676.26	to make large screen displays,
679.26	"so that we can watch movies like ""Godzilla"""
681.26	in high-def.
684.26	And if we can build machines
686.26	at that scale,
688.26	what about Eiffel Tower-like trusses
691.26	at the microscale?
693.26	Today we are making metals
696.26	that are lighter than Styrofoam,
698.26	so light
700.26	they can sit atop a dandelion puff
702.26	and be blown away
704.26	with a wisp of air --
706.26	so light
708.26	that you can make a car that two people can lift,
711.26	but so strong
713.26	that it has the crash-worthiness of an SUV.
716.26	From the smallest wisp of air
719.26	to the powerful forces of nature's storms.
722.26	There are 44 lightning strikes per second
725.26	around the globe.
727.26	Each lightning bolt heats the air
730.26	to 44,000 degrees Fahrenheit --
732.26	hotter than the surface of the Sun.
735.26	What if we could use
737.26	these electromagnetic pulses
739.26	as beacons,
741.26	beacons in a moving network
744.26	of powerful transmitters?
747.26	Experiments suggest
749.26	that lightning could be the next GPS.
754.26	Electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains.
757.26	Using a grid the size of your thumb,
760.26	with 32 electrodes
762.26	on the surface of his brain,
764.26	Tim uses his thoughts
766.26	to control an advanced prosthetic arm.
772.26	And his thoughts
774.26	made him reach for Katie.
776.26	This is the first time
780.26	a human has controlled a robot
782.26	with thought alone.
785.26	And it is the first time
787.26	that Tim has held Katie's hand
789.26	in seven years.
791.26	That moment mattered
793.26	to Tim and Katie,
795.26	and this green goo
797.26	may someday matter to you.
800.26	This green goo
802.26	is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life.
805.26	It was made in tobacco plants.
808.26	Tobacco plants
810.26	can make millions of doses of vaccine
813.26	in weeks instead of months,
816.26	and it might just be
818.26	the first healthy use of tobacco ever.
822.26	And if it seems far-fetched
824.26	that tobacco plants could make people healthy,
827.26	what about gamers that could solve problems
830.26	that experts can't solve?
832.26	Last September,
834.26	the gamers of Foldit
836.26	solved the three-dimensional structure
838.26	of the retroviral protease
840.26	that contributes to AIDS in rhesus monkeys.
843.26	Now understanding this structure
845.26	is very important for developing treatments.
849.26	For 15 years,
851.26	it was unsolved
853.26	in the scientific community.
855.26	The gamers of Foldit
857.26	solved it in 15 days.
860.26	Now they were able to do so
862.26	by working together.
864.26	They were able to work together
866.26	because they're connected by the Internet.
868.26	And others, also connected to the Internet,
871.26	used it as an instrument of democracy.
875.26	And together
877.26	they changed the fate of their nation.
880.26	The Internet is home to two billion people,
883.26	or 30 percent of the world's population.
886.26	It allows us to contribute
889.26	and to be heard
891.26	as individuals.
893.26	It allows us to amplify
896.26	our voices and our power
899.26	as a group.
901.26	But it too had humble beginnings.
904.26	In 1969, the internet was but a dream,
907.26	a few sketches on a piece of paper.
909.26	And then on October 29th,
912.26	the first packet-switched message was sent
914.26	from UCLA to SRI.
917.26	"The first two letters of the word ""Login,"""
920.26	that's all that made it through --
922.26	an L and an O --
924.26	and then a buffer overflow crashed the system.
926.26	(Laughter)
929.26	Two letters,
931.26	an L and an O,
934.26	now a worldwide force.
938.26	So who are these scientists and engineers
941.26	at a magical place called DARPA?
944.26	They are nerds,
947.26	and they are heroes among us.
950.26	They challenge existing perspectives
952.26	at the edges of science
954.26	and under the most demanding of conditions.
958.26	They remind us
960.26	that we can change the world
962.26	if we defy the impossible
964.26	and we refuse to fear failure.
968.26	They remind us
970.26	that we all have nerd power.
973.26	Sometimes we just forget.
977.26	You see, there was a time
979.26	when you weren't afraid of failure,
981.26	when you were a great artist or a great dancer
984.26	and you could sing, you were good at math,
986.26	you could build things, you were an astronaut,
989.26	an adventurer, Jacques Cousteau,
991.26	you could jump higher, run faster,
993.26	kick harder than anyone.
996.26	You believed in impossible things
998.26	and you were fearless.
1000.26	You were totally and completely in touch
1004.26	with your inner superhero.
1008.26	Scientists and engineers
1011.26	can indeed change the world.
1014.26	So can you.
1016.26	You were born to.
1018.26	So go ahead,
1020.26	ask yourself,
1022.26	what would you attempt to do
1025.26	if you knew you could not fail?
1027.26	Now I want to say,
1029.26	this is not easy.
1032.26	It's hard to hold onto this feeling,
1034.26	really hard.
1036.26	I guess in some way,
1038.26	I sort of believe it's supposed to be hard.
1040.26	Doubt and fear always creep in.
1043.26	We think someone else, someone smarter than us,
1046.26	someone more capable,
1048.26	someone with more resources will solve that problem.
1051.26	But there isn't anyone else;
1053.26	there's just you.
1056.26	And if we're lucky,
1058.26	in that moment,
1060.26	someone steps into that doubt and fear,
1063.26	takes a hand and says,
1066.26	"""Let me help you believe."""
1069.26	Jason Harley did that for me.
1072.26	Jason started at DARPA
1075.26	on March 18th, 2010.
1077.26	He was with our transportation team.
1081.26	I saw Jason nearly every day,
1083.26	sometimes twice a day.
1085.26	And more so than most,
1087.26	he saw the highs and the lows,
1090.26	the celebrations and the disappointments.
1094.26	And on one particularly dark day for me,
1098.26	Jason sat down
1100.26	and he wrote an email.
1103.26	He was encouraging,
1105.26	but firm.
1107.26	And when he hit send,
1109.26	he probably didn't realize what a difference it would make.
1112.26	It mattered to me.
1114.26	In that moment
1116.26	and still today
1119.26	when I doubt,
1121.26	when I feel afraid,
1124.26	when I need to reconnect
1126.26	with that feeling,
1128.26	I remember his words,
1131.26	they were so powerful.
1133.26	"Text: ""There is only time enough to iron your cape"

1173.26	And remember,
1175.26	be nice to nerds.
1177.26	(Applause)
1192.26	Thank you. Thank you.
1194.26	(Applause)
1196.26	Chris Anderson: Regina, thank you.
1198.26	I have a couple of questions.
1200.26	So that glider of yours,
1202.26	the Mach 20 glider,
1204.26	the first one, no control, it ended up in the Pacific I think somewhere.
1207.26	RD: Yeah, yeah. It did. (CA: What happened on that second flight?)
1210.26	Yeah, it also went into the Pacific. (CA: But this time under control?)
1214.26	We didn't fly it into the Pacific.
1217.26	No, there are multiple portions of the trajectory
1220.26	that are demanding
1222.26	in terms of really flying at that speed.
1225.26	And so in the second flight,
1228.26	we were able to get three minutes
1230.26	of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it.
1234.26	CA: I imagine you're not planning to open up to passenger service
1237.26	from New York to Long Beach anytime soon.
1239.26	RD: It might be a little warm.
1242.26	CA: What do you picture that glider being used for?
1245.26	RD: Well our responsibility
1247.26	is to develop the technology for this.
1249.26	How it's ultimately used
1251.26	will be determined by the military.
1253.26	Now the purpose of the vehicle though,
1256.26	the purpose of the technology,
1258.26	is to be able to reach anywhere in the world
1260.26	in less than 60 minutes.
1262.26	CA: And to carry a payload
1264.26	of more than a few pounds? (RD: Yeah.)
1266.26	Like what's the payload it could carry?
1270.26	RD: Well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be, right.
1273.26	We've got to fly it first.
1275.26	CA: But not necessarily just a camera?
1277.26	RD: No, not necessarily just a camera.
1281.26	CA: It's amazing.
1284.26	The hummingbird?
1286.26	RD: Yeah?
1288.26	CA: I'm curious, you started your beautiful sequence on flight
1292.26	with a plane kind of trying to flap its wings
1294.26	and failing horribly,
1296.26	and there haven't been that many planes built since
1299.26	that flap wings.
1301.26	Why did we think that this was the time to go biomimicry
1304.26	and copy a hummingbird?
1306.26	Isn't that a very expensive solution
1308.26	for a small maneuverable flying object?
1312.26	RD: So I mean, in part,
1314.26	we wondered if it was possible to do it.
1316.26	And you have to revisit these questions
1318.26	over time.
1320.26	The folks at AeroVironment
1322.26	tried 300 or more different wing designs,
1328.26	It took them 10 full prototypes
1330.26	to get something that would actually fly.
1332.26	But there's something really interesting
1335.26	about a flying machine
1337.26	that looks like something you'd recognize.
1340.26	So we often talk about stealth
1342.26	as a means for avoiding any type of sensing,
1345.26	but when things looks just natural,
1348.26	you also don't see them.
1350.26	CA: Ah. So it's not necessarily just the performance.
1353.26	It's partly the look. (RD: Sure.)
1355.26	"It's actually, ""Look at that cute hummingbird"
1357.26	"flying into my headquarters."""
1359.26	(Laughter)
1363.26	Because I think, as well as the awe of looking at that,
1365.26	I'm sure some people here are thinking,
1367.26	technology catches up so quick,
1369.26	how long is it
1371.26	before some crazed geek with a little remote control
1373.26	flies one through a window of the White House?
1375.26	I mean, do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here?
1379.26	RD: Well look, our singular mission
1383.26	is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise.
1386.26	That's what we do.
1388.26	It would be inconceivable
1390.26	for us to do that work
1393.26	if we didn't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do
1396.26	at the same time.
1398.26	It's just the nature of what we do.
1401.26	Now our responsibility
1403.26	is to push that edge.
1405.26	And we have to be, of course, mindful and responsible
1409.26	of how the technology is developed
1411.26	and ultimately used,
1413.26	but we can't simply close our eyes
1415.26	and pretend that it isn't advancing; it's advancing.
1418.26	CA: I mean, you're clearly a really inspiring leader.
1422.26	And you persuade people
1424.26	to go to these great feats of invention,
1426.26	but at a personal level,
1428.26	in a way I can't imagine doing your job.
1430.26	Do you wake up in the night sometimes,
1432.26	just asking questions
1434.26	about the possibly unintended consequences
1436.26	of your team's brilliance?
1438.26	RD: Sure.
1440.26	I think you couldn't be human
1443.26	if you didn't ask those questions.
1445.26	CA: How do you answer them?
1447.26	RD: Well I don't always have answers for them, right.
1451.26	I think that we learn
1454.26	as time goes on.
1456.26	My job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you could have.
1462.26	I work with some of the most amazing people.
1466.26	And with that exhilaration,
1468.26	comes a really deep sense
1470.26	of responsibility.
1472.26	And so you have on the one hand
1474.26	this tremendous lift
1477.26	of what's possible
1480.26	and this tremendous seriousness
1483.26	of what it means.
1485.26	CA: Regina, that was jaw-dropping, as they say.
1488.26	Thank you so much for coming to TED. (RD: Thank you.)
1491.26	(Applause)
