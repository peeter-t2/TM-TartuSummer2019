12.74	So there's this thing called
12.74	the law of unintended consequences.
17.22	I thought it was just like a saying,
18.98	but it actually exists, I guess.
20.58	There's, like, academic papers about it.
22.94	And I'm a designer.
24.22	I don't like unintended consequences.
27.1	People hire me because they have
27.1	consequences that they really intend,
31.7	and what they intend is for me
31.7	to help them achieve those consequences.
35.58	So I live in fear
35.58	of unintended consequences.
38.62	And so this is a story about
38.62	consequences intended and unintended.
43.9	I got called by an organization
43.9	called Robin Hood
47.06	to do a favor for them.
48.66	Robin Hood is based in New York,
48.66	a wonderful philanthropic organization
52.1	that does what it says in the name.
53.86	They take from rich people,
53.86	give it to poor people.
56.66	In this case, what they wanted to benefit
56.66	was the New York City school system,
61.58	a huge enterprise that educates
61.58	more than a million students at a time,
66.94	and in buildings that are like this one,
69.3	old buildings, big buildings,
71.22	drafty buildings, sometimes buildings
71.22	that are in disrepair,
74.38	certainly buildings
74.38	that could use a renovation.
76.94	Robin Hood had this ambition
76.94	to improve these buildings in some way,
80.22	but what they realized was
81.7	to fix the buildings would be
81.7	too expensive and impractical.
86.26	So instead they tried to figure out
86.26	what one room they could go into
90.66	in each of these buildings,
90.66	in as many buildings that they could,
93.74	and fix that one room
96.42	so that they could improve
96.42	the lives of the children inside
99.26	as they were studying.
100.5	And what they came up with
100.5	was the school library,
102.94	and they came up with this idea
102.94	called the Library Initiative.
105.9	All the students
105.9	have to pass through the library.
108.3	That's where the books are.
109.66	That's where the heart
109.66	and soul of the school is.
112.02	So let's fix these libraries.
113.46	So they did this wonderful thing
113.46	where they brought in
116.02	first 10, then 20, then more architects,
119.14	each one of whom was assigned a library
119.14	to rethink what a library was.
122.9	They trained special librarians.
124.98	So they started this mighty enterprise
127.06	to reform public schools
127.06	by improving these libraries.
130.1	Then they called me up and they said,
130.1	"""Could you make a little contribution?"""
133.78	"I said, ""Sure, what do you want me to do?"""
135.82	"And they said, ""Well, we want you"
135.82	to be the graphic designer
138.7	"in charge of the whole thing."""
140.18	And so I thought, I know what that means.
140.18	That means I get to design a logo.
143.78	I know how to design that. I design logos.
145.82	That's what people come to me for.
147.5	So OK, let's design a logo for this thing.
149.62	Easy to do, actually,
149.62	compared with architecture
151.9	and being a librarian.
153.18	Just do a logo, make a contribution,
153.18	and then you're out,
155.94	and you feel really good about yourself.
157.9	And I'm a great guy and I like to feel
157.9	good about myself when I do these favors.
161.7	So I thought, let's overdeliver.
163.3	I'm going to give you three logos,
163.3	all based on this one idea.
166.26	So you have three options,
166.26	pick any of the three.
168.62	They're all great, I said.
169.94	So the basic idea was
169.94	these would be new school libraries
173.18	for New York schools,
174.74	and so the idea is that it's a new thing,
174.74	a new idea that needs a new name.
178.62	What I wanted to do was dispel the idea
178.62	that these were musty old libraries,
183.66	the kind of places
183.66	that everyone is bored with,
187.3	you know, not your grandparents' library.
189.3	Don't worry about that at all.
190.78	This is going to this new, exciting thing,
192.82	not a boring library.
194.1	So option number one:
195.78	so instead of thinking of it as a library,
197.82	think of it as a place where it is like:
197.82	do talk, do make loud noises.
202.02	Right? So no shushing,
202.02	it's like a shush-free zone.
206.06	We're going to call it the Reading Room.
208.26	That was option number one.
208.26	OK, option number two.
211.66	Option number two was, wait for it,
215.1	OWL.
216.38	I'll meet you at OWL.
217.74	I'm getting my book from the OWL.
217.74	Meet you after school down at OWL.
221.06	I like that, right?
221.06	Now, what does OWL stand for?
223.42	Well, it could be One World Library,
225.34	or it could be Open. Wonder. Learn.
227.98	Or it could be -- and I figure librarians
227.98	could figure out other things it could be
232.5	because they know about words.
233.98	So other things, right?
235.22	And then look at this.
235.22	It's like the eye of the owl.
237.7	This is irresistible in my opinion.
239.42	But there's even another idea.
240.9	Option number three.
242.14	Option number three
242.14	was based actually on language.
244.78	"It's the idea that ""read"""
244.78	"is the past tense of ""read,"""
248.1	and they're both spelled the same way.
249.98	So why don't we call
249.98	this place The Red Zone?
252.94	I'll meet you at the Red Zone.
254.393	Are you Red? Get Red.
257.7	I'm well Red.
258.94	(Laughter)
260.18	I really loved this idea,
261.54	and I somehow was not focused on the idea
263.9	that librarians as a class are sort of
263.9	interested in spelling and I don't know.
269.82	(Laughter)
271.779	But sometimes cleverness
271.779	is more important than spelling,
275.3	and I thought this would be
275.3	one of those instances.
277.74	So usually when I make these presentations
279.78	I say there's just one question
279.78	and the question should be,
282.58	"""How can I thank you, Mike?"""
283.98	But in this case,
283.98	the question was more like,
286.62	"""Um, are you kidding?"""
289.06	Because, they said,
290.78	the premise of all this work
292.18	was that kids were bored
292.18	with old libraries, musty old libraries.
296.34	They were tired of them.
297.58	And instead, they said, these kids
297.58	have never really seen a library.
300.94	The school libraries in these schools
302.78	are really so dilapidated,
302.78	if they're there at all,
306.22	that they haven't bored anyone.
308.18	They haven't even been there
308.18	to bore anyone at all.
311.18	So the idea was, just forget
311.18	about giving it a new name.
314.62	Just call it, one last try, a library.
318.7	Right? OK.
319.94	So I thought, OK, give it a little oomph?
322.82	Exclamation point?
324.06	Then -- this is because I'm clever --
326.06	"move that into the ""i,"""
328.62	make it red,
329.9	and there you have it,
329.9	the Library Initiative.
332.1	So I thought, mission accomplished,
332.1	there's your logo.
334.66	So what's interesting about this logo,
334.66	an unintended consequence,
337.74	was that it turned out that
337.74	they didn't really even need my design
340.9	because you could type it any font,
340.9	you could write it by hand,
343.9	and when they started
343.9	sending emails around,
346.02	they just would use Shift and 1,
347.62	they'd get their own logo
347.62	just right out of the thing.
350.22	And I thought, well, that's fine.
351.98	Feel free to use that logo.
353.78	And then I embarked
353.78	on the real rollout of this thing --
356.7	working with every one of the architects
358.66	to put this logo on the front door
358.66	of their own library. Right?
362.18	So here's the big rollout.
363.58	Basically I'd work
363.58	with different architects.
365.86	First Robin Hood was my client.
365.86	Now these architects were my client.
369.1	"I'd say, ""Here's your logo."
369.1	"Put it on the door."""
371.363	"""Here's your logo. Put it on both doors."""
373.34	"""Here's your logo."
373.34	"Put it off to the side."""
375.38	"""Here's your logo"
375.38	"repeated all over to the top."""
377.66	So everything was going swimmingly.
379.38	I just was saying,
379.38	"""Here's your logo. Here's your logo."""
382.06	Then I got a call
382.06	from one of the architects,
384.22	a guy named Richard Lewis,
384.22	"and he says, ""I've got a problem."
387.1	You're the graphics guy.
387.1	"Can you solve it?"""
389.14	"And I said, OK, sure."""
390.38	"And he said, ""The problem is"
390.38	that there's a space
392.98	"between the shelf and the ceiling."""
394.82	So that sounds like
394.82	an architectural issue to me,
397.18	not a graphic design issue,
397.18	"so I'm, ""Go on."""
399.3	"And Richard says, ""Well,"
399.3	the top shelf has to be low enough
402.98	for the kid to reach it,
404.22	but I'm in a big old building,
404.22	and the ceilings are really high,
407.244	so actually I've got
407.244	all this space up there
409.34	"and I need something like a mural."""
411.06	"And I'm like, ""Whoa,"
411.06	you know, I'm a logo designer.
414.02	I'm not Diego Rivera or something.
416.18	"I'm not a muralist."""
417.82	"And so he said, ""But can't you"
417.82	"think of anything?"""
420.22	"So I said, ""OK, what if we just"
420.22	took pictures of the kids in the school
425.62	and just put them around
425.62	the top of the thing,
428.1	"and maybe that could work."""
429.46	And my wife is a photographer,
431.34	"and I said, ""Dorothy, there's no budget,"
433.3	can you come to this school
433.3	"in east New York, take these pictures?"""
436.5	And she did,
437.74	and if you go in Richard's library,
439.74	which is one of the first that opened,
441.62	it has this glorious frieze
441.62	of, like, the heroes of the school,
444.74	oversized, looking down
446.46	into the little dollhouse
446.46	of the real library, right?
449.5	And the kids were great,
449.5	hand-selected by the principals
452.34	and the librarian.
454.14	It just kind of created
454.14	this heroic atmosphere in this library,
457.42	this very dignified setting below
457.42	and the joy of the children above.
460.94	So naturally all the other librarians
460.94	in the other schools see this
465.3	and they said, well, we want murals too.
467.26	And I'm like, OK.
468.58	So then I think, well,
468.58	it can't be the same mural every time,
471.5	so Dorothy did another one,
471.5	and then she did another one,
474.58	but then we needed more help,
476.22	so I called an illustrator I knew
476.22	named Lynn Pauley,
479.1	and Lynn did these beautiful
479.1	paintings of the kids.
482.06	Then I called a guy named Charles Wilkin
482.06	at a place called Automatic Design.
486.42	He did these amazing collages.
488.78	We had Rafael Esquer
491.14	do these great silhouettes.
493.02	He would work with the kids,
493.02	asking for words,
495.22	and then based on those prompts,
496.82	come up with this little,
496.82	delirious kind of constellation
499.54	of silhouettes
499.54	of things that are in books.
501.62	Peter Arkle interviewed the kids
503.22	and had them talk
503.22	about their favorite books
505.34	and he put their testimony
505.34	as a frieze up there.
507.62	Stefan Sagmeister worked with Yuko Shimizu
509.9	and they did this amazing
509.9	manga-style statement,
512.22	"""Everyone who is honest is interesting,"""
514.7	that goes all the way around.
516.58	Christoph Niemann, brilliant illustrator,
518.98	did a whole series of things
520.38	where he embedded books
520.38	into the faces and characters
523.42	and images and places
523.42	that you find in the books.
526.58	And then even Maira Kalman
528.66	did this amazing cryptic installation
528.66	of objects and words
532.499	that kind of go all around
532.499	and will fascinate students
535.7	for as long as it's up there.
537.3	So this was really satisfying,
538.98	and basically my role here was reading
538.98	a series of dimensions to these artists,
544.9	and I would say,
546.18	"""Three feet by 15 feet, whatever you want."
548.9	Let me know if you have
548.9	"any problem with that."""
551.14	And they would go and install these.
551.14	It just was the greatest thing.
554.38	But the greatest thing, actually, was --
556.7	Every once in a while,
557.94	I'd get, like, an invitation in the mail
557.94	made of construction paper,
561.18	"and it would say, ""You are invited"
561.18	"to the opening of our new library."""
564.5	So you'd go to the library,
564.5	say, you'd go to PS10,
566.9	and you'd go inside.
568.14	There'd be balloons,
568.14	there'd be a student ambassador,
570.94	there'd be speeches that were read,
573.1	poetry that was written
573.1	specifically for the opening,
576.02	dignitaries would present people
576.02	with certificates,
578.98	and the whole thing
578.98	was just a delirious, fun party.
581.62	So I loved going to these things.
583.26	I would stand there dressed like this,
583.26	obviously not belonging,
586.26	and someone would say,
586.26	"""What are you doing here, mister?"""
588.951	"And I'd say, ""Well, I'm part of the team"
588.951	"that designed this place."""
592.14	"And they'd said, ""You do these shelves?"""
594.069	"And I said, ""No."""
594.069	"""You took the pictures up above."""
596.5	"""No."""
597.74	"""Well, what did you do?"""
598.98	"""You know when you came in?"
598.98	"The sign over the door?"""
601.46	"""The sign that says library?"""
602.9	(Laughter)
603.94	"""Yeah, I did that!"""
605.18	And then they'd sort of go,
605.18	"""OK. Nice work if you can get it."""
610.02	So it was so satisfying
610.02	going to these little openings
614.14	despite the fact that I was
614.14	kind of largely ignored or humiliated,
617.9	but it was actually fun
617.9	going to the openings,
620.1	so I decided that I wanted
620.1	to get the people in my office
622.82	who had worked on these projects,
622.82	get the illustrators and photographers,
626.3	and I said, why don't we rent a van
628.02	and drive around
628.02	the five boroughs of New York
630.42	and see how many we could hit at one time.
632.46	And eventually there were
632.46	going to be 60 of these libraries,
635.34	so we probably got to see
635.34	maybe half a dozen in one long day.
639.14	And the best thing of all
639.14	was meeting these librarians
642.1	who kind of were running these,
642.1	took possession of these places
645.7	like their private stage
645.7	upon which they were invited
648.3	to mesmerize their students
648.3	and bring the books to life,
652.26	and it was just
652.26	this really exciting experience
654.82	for all of us to actually
654.82	see these things in action.
657.66	So we spent a long day doing this
660.22	and we were in the very last library.
662.06	It was still winter,
662.06	because it got dark early,
664.9	and the librarian says,
666.14	"""I'm about to close down."
666.14	So really nice having you here.
668.86	Hey, wait a second, do you want to see
668.86	"how I turn off the lights?"""
672.02	"I'm like, ""OK."""
673.34	"And she said, ""I have"
673.34	"this special way that I do it."""
675.86	And then she showed me.
677.14	What she did was she turned out
677.14	every light one by one by one by one,
680.62	and the last light she left on
682.7	was the light that illuminated
682.7	the kids' faces,
685.62	"and she said, ""That's the last light"
685.62	I turn off every night,
688.5	because I like to remind myself
688.5	"why I come to work."""
691.1	So when I started this whole thing,
693.98	remember, it was just
693.98	about designing that logo
696.195	and being clever, come up with a new name?
698.22	The unintended consequence here,
699.82	which I would like to take credit for
701.66	and like to think I can think through
701.66	the experience to that extent,
704.9	but I can't.
706.14	I was just focused on a foot ahead of me,
706.14	as far as I could reach with my own hands.
710.14	Instead, way off in the distance
712.74	was a librarian
714.02	who was going to find
714.02	the chain of consequences
716.98	that we had set in motion,
718.42	a source of inspiration
719.94	so that she in this case
719.94	could do her work really well.
	are affected by these libraries.
726.74	They've been happening
726.74	for more than 10 years now,
729.22	so those librarians have kind of turned on
729.22	a generation of children to books
733.78	and so it's been a thrill to find out
736.3	that sometimes unintended consequences
736.3	are the best consequences.
740.06	Thank you very much.
741.3	(Applause)
