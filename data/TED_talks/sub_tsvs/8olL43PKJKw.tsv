13.86	Vanessa Garrison: I am Vanessa,
15.62	daughter of Annette,
17.26	daughter of Olympia,
19.06	daughter of Melvina,
20.62	daughter of Katie, born 1878,
23.94	Parish County, Louisiana.
26.42	T. Morgan Dixon: And my name is Morgan,
28.34	daughter of Carol,
28.34	daughter of Letha, daughter of Willie,
31.1	daughter of Sarah,
31.1	born 1849 in Bardstown, Kentucky.
35.5	VG: And in the tradition of our families,
37.54	the great oral tradition
37.54	of almost every black church we know
40.86	honoring the culture
40.86	from which we draw so much power,
44.78	we're gonna start the way our mommas
44.78	and grandmas would want us to start.
48.26	TMD: In prayer. Let the words of my mouth,
50.94	the meditation of our hearts,
50.94	be acceptable in thy sight,
54.1	oh Lord, my strength and my redeemer.
57.82	VG: We call the names and rituals
57.82	of our ancestors into this room today
62.34	because from them we received
62.34	a powerful blueprint for survival,
66.82	strategies and tactics for healing
66.82	carried across oceans by African women,
71.42	passed down to generations
71.42	of black women in America
74.78	who used those skills
74.78	to navigate institutions of slavery
79.14	and state-sponsored discrimination
81.06	in order that we might
81.06	stand on this stage.
84.38	We walk in the footsteps of those women,
87.14	our foremothers, legends
89.46	like Ella Baker, Septima Clark,
89.46	Fannie Lou Hamer,
93.42	from whom we learned
93.42	the power of organizing
96.34	after she would had
96.34	single-handedly registered
103.5	TMD: 60,000 is a lot of people,
103.5	so if you can imagine
107.18	me and Vanessa inspiring
111.66	we were fired up.
113.66	But today, 100,000 black women and girls
113.66	stand on this stage with us.
119.62	We are committed to healing ourselves,
122.3	to lacing up our sneakers,
122.3	to walking out of our front door
125.1	every single day for total healing
125.1	and transformation in our communities,
128.66	because we understand
130.3	that we are in the footsteps
130.3	of a civil rights legacy
132.82	like no other time before,
134.94	and that we are facing a health crisis
134.94	like never ever before.
137.9	And so we've had
137.9	a lot of moments, great moments,
140.94	including the time we had on our pajamas,
140.94	we were working on our computer
144.42	and Michelle Obama emailed us
144.42	and invited us to the White House,
147.5	and we thought it was spam.
148.9	But this moment here is an opportunity.
152.34	It is an opportunity
152.34	that we don't take for granted,
155.1	and so we thought long and hard
155.1	about how we would use it.
157.86	Would we talk to the women
157.86	we hope to inspire,
160.58	a million in the next year,
162.34	or would we talk to you?
164.78	We decided to talk to you,
167.06	and to talk to you about a question
167.06	that we get all the time,
171.66	so that the millions of women
171.66	who hopefully will watch this
174.5	will never have to answer it again.
176.9	It is: Why are black women dying
179.98	faster and at higher rates
181.94	than any other group of people in America
184.42	from preventable,
184.42	obesity-related diseases?
188.58	The question hurts me.
190.02	I'm shaking a little bit.
191.46	It feels value-laden.
193.14	It hurts my body because the weight
193.14	represents so much.
197.1	But we're going to talk about it
198.7	and invite you into
198.7	an inside conversation today
200.98	because it is necessary,
200.98	and because we need you.
205.94	VG: Each night,
205.94	before the first day of school,
208.18	my grandmother
208.18	would sit me next to the stove
210.86	and with expert precision
210.86	use a hot comb to press my hair.
214.7	My grandmother was legendary, big, loud.
218.22	She filled up a room with laughter
218.22	and oftentimes curse words.
221.18	She cooked a mean peach cobbler,
223.18	had 11 children,
223.18	a house full of grandchildren,
225.74	and like every black woman I know,
228.22	like most all women I know,
229.98	she had prioritized the care of others
229.98	over caring for herself.
234.34	We measured her strength by her capacity
234.34	to endure pain and suffering.
238.1	We celebrated her for it,
238.1	and our choice would prove to be deadly.
241.98	One night after pressing my hair
241.98	before the first day of eighth grade,
245.34	my grandmother went to bed
245.34	and never woke up,
248.18	dead at 66 years old from a heart attack.
251.54	By the time I would graduate college,
253.42	I would lose two more beloved
253.42	family members to chronic disease:
256.94	my aunt Diane, dead at 55,
256.94	my aunt Tricia, dead at 63.
261.3	After living with these losses,
261.3	the hole that they left,
264.14	I decided to calculate the life expectancy
264.14	of the women in my family.
268.659	Staring back at me, the number 65.
272.14	I knew I could not sit by
273.74	and watch another woman I loved
273.74	die an early death.
277.98	TMD: So we don't usually
277.98	put our business in the streets.
280.7	Let's just put that out there.
282.18	But I have to tell you the statistics.
284.14	Black women are dying at alarming rates,
286.94	and I used to be a classroom teacher,
288.82	and I was at South Atlanta High School,
290.74	and I remember standing
290.74	in front of my classroom,
293.1	and I remember a statistic
293.1	that half of black girls will get diabetes
297.82	unless diet and levels of activity change.
300.62	Half of the girls in my classroom.
300.62	So I couldn't teach anymore.
304.18	So I started taking girls hiking,
304.18	which is why we're called GirlTrek,
307.46	but Vanessa was like,
308.7	that is not going to move the dial
308.7	on the health crisis; it's cute.
311.9	She was like, it's a cute hiking club.
313.78	So what we thought
315.46	is if we could rally
315.46	a million of their mothers ...
	are over a healthy weight right now.
328.82	But the number that I cannot,
331.66	that I cannot get out of my head
333.26	is that every single day in America,
339.22	die from a preventable disease,
341.34	heart disease.
342.58	That's every 11 minutes.
347.98	cigarette smoking and HIV combined,
351.5	every day.
352.86	It is roughly the amount of people
354.54	that were on my plane
354.54	from New Jersey to Vancouver.
357.46	Can you imagine that?
358.7	A plane filled with black women
358.7	crashing to the ground every day,
363.18	and no one is talking about it.
366.42	VG: So the question that you're all
366.42	asking yourselves right now is why?
369.78	Why are black women dying?
369.78	We asked ourselves that same question.
372.9	Why is what's out there
372.9	not working for them?
375.34	Private weight loss companies,
375.34	government interventions,
378.02	public health campaigns.
379.38	I'm going to tell you why:
380.86	because they focus on weight loss
382.5	or looking good in skinny jeans
384.02	without acknowledging the trauma
386.06	that black women
386.06	hold in our bellies and bones,
388.98	that has been embedded in our very DNA.
391.82	The best advice
391.82	from hospitals and doctors,
394.18	the best medications
394.18	from pharmaceutical companies
396.7	to treat the congestive heart failure
396.7	of my grandmother didn't work
400.1	because they didn't acknowledge
400.1	the systemic racism
402.74	that she had dealt with since birth.
404.5	(Applause)
405.54	A divestment in schools,
405.54	discriminatory housing practices,
408.9	predatory lending,
408.9	a crack cocaine epidemic,
411.98	mass incarceration putting
411.98	more black bodies behind bars
415.38	than were owned at the height of slavery.
417.62	But GirlTrek does.
419.42	For black women whose bodies
419.42	are buckling under the weight
422.18	of systems never designed to support them,
424.9	GirlTrek is a lifeline.
426.98	August 16, 2015, Danita Kimball,
426.98	a member of GirlTrek in Detroit,
431.58	received the news that too many
431.58	black mothers have received.
434.86	Her son Norman, 23 years old,
434.86	a father of two,
438.26	was gunned down
438.26	while on an afternoon drive.
441.26	Imagine the grief
442.98	that overcomes your body in that moment,
445.42	the immobilizing fear.
447.74	Now, know this, that just days
447.74	after laying her son to rest,
451.26	Danita Kimball posted online,
453.02	"""I don't know what to do"
453.02	or how to move forward,
455.78	but my sisters keep telling me
455.78	"I need to walk, so I will."""
458.82	And then just days after that,
461.38	"""I got my steps in today for my baby Norm."
463.66	"It felt good to be out there, to walk."""
468.3	TMD: Walking through pain
468.3	is what we have always done.
470.86	My mom, she's in the middle right there,
474.06	my mom desegregated
474.06	her high school in 1955.
477.42	Her mom walked down the steps
477.42	of an abandoned school bus
480.18	where she raised 11 kids
480.18	as a sharecropper.
483.1	And her mom stepped onto Indian territory
485.3	fleeing the terrors of the Jim Crow South.
487.98	And her mom walked her man to the door
490.98	as he went off to fight
490.98	in the Kentucky Colored Regiment,
494.46	the Civil War.
496.18	They were born slaves
496.18	but they wouldn't die slaves.
498.62	Change-making, it's in my blood.
500.54	It's what I do,
501.82	and this health crisis ain't nothing
501.82	compared to the road we have traveled.
507.78	(Applause)
512.74	So it's like James Cleveland.
514.18	I don't feel no ways tired,
514.18	so we got to work.
516.74	We started looking at models of change.
518.82	We looked all over the world.
520.26	We needed something
521.5	not only that was a part
521.5	of our cultural inheritance like walking,
524.66	but something that was scalable,
524.66	something that was high-impact,
527.739	something that we could replicate
527.739	across this country.
530.34	So we studied models like Wangari Maathai,
530.34	who won the Nobel Peace Prize
533.78	for inspiring women
533.78	to plant 50 million trees in Kenya.
536.42	She brought Kenya back from the brink
536.42	of environmental devastation.
539.62	We studied these systems of change,
539.62	and we looked at walking scientifically.
544.02	And what we learned
544.02	is that walking just 30 minutes a day
547.1	can single-handedly decrease
552.38	heart disease, stroke,
552.38	even Alzheimer's and dementia.
556.42	We know that walking
556.42	is the single most powerful thing
560.46	that a woman can do for her health,
562.62	so we knew we were on to something,
564.42	because from Harriet Tubman
564.42	to the women in Montgomery,
567.06	when black women walk, things change.
568.9	(Applause)
569.94	VG: So how did we take
569.94	this simple idea of walking
572.5	and start a revolution
572.5	that would catch a fire
574.7	in neighborhoods across America?
576.66	We used the best practices
576.66	of the Civil Rights Movement.
579.58	We huddled up in church basements.
581.26	We did grapevine information sharing
581.26	through beauty salons.
584.18	We empowered and trained mothers
584.18	to stand on the front lines.
587.1	We took our message
587.1	directly to the streets,
589.62	and women responded.
591.06	Women like LaKeisha in Chattanooga,
593.42	Chrysantha in Detroit,
595.66	Onika in New Orleans,
597.22	women with difficult names
597.22	and difficult stories
600.18	join GirlTrek every day and commit
600.18	to walking as a practice of self-care.
605.1	Once walking, those women
605.1	get to organizing,
607.58	first their families,
607.58	then their communities,
609.74	to walk and talk
609.74	and solve problems together.
612.58	They walk and notice
612.58	the abandoned building.
614.7	They walk and notice
614.7	the lack of sidewalks,
616.74	the lack of green space,
618.02	"and they say, ""No more."""
619.3	Women like Susie Paige in Philadelphia,
621.22	who after walking daily past
621.22	an abandoned building in her neighborhood,
624.74	"decided, ""I'm not waiting."
626.22	Let me rally my team.
626.22	Let me grab some supplies.
628.58	Let me do what no one else has done
628.58	"for me and my community."""
633.54	TMD: We know one woman
633.54	can make a difference,
635.7	because one woman
635.7	has already changed the world,
637.98	and her name is Harriet Tubman.
639.54	And trust me, I love Harriet Tubman.
641.94	I'm obsessed with her,
641.94	and I used to be a history teacher.
644.7	I will not tell you the whole history.
646.58	I will tell you four things.
647.98	So I used to have an old Saab --
650.02	the kind of canvas top that drips
650.02	on your head when it rains --
653.02	and I drove all the way down
653.02	to the eastern shore of Maryland,
655.949	and when I stepped on the dirt
657.42	that Harriet Tubman made her first escape,
660.38	I knew she was a woman just like we are
662.5	and that we could do what she had done,
664.42	and we learned four things
664.42	from Harriet Tubman.
666.74	The first one: do not wait.
669.54	Walk right now in the direction
669.54	of your healthiest, most fulfilled life,
674.06	because self-care is a revolutionary act.
676.82	Number two:
678.18	when you learn the way forward,
678.18	come back and get a sister.
681.42	So in our case,
681.42	start a team with your friends --
683.78	your friends, your family, your church.
685.7	Number three:
687.34	rally your allies.
690.82	Every single person in this room
693.7	is complicit in
693.7	a Tubman-inspired takeover.
696.82	And number four:
698.7	find joy.
700.74	The most underreported
700.74	fact of Harriet Tubman
703.02	is that she lived to be 93 years old,
705.58	and she didn't live
705.58	just an ordinary life; uh-uh.
707.94	She was standing up for the good guys.
707.94	She married a younger man.
711.06	She adopted a child.
711.06	I'm not kidding. She lived.
714.3	And I drove up to her house
714.3	of freedom in upstate New York,
717.14	and she had planted apple trees,
719.06	and when I was there on a Sunday,
719.06	they were blooming.
721.74	Do you call it -- do they bloom?
723.34	The apples were in season,
725.06	and I was thinking, she left fruit for us,
728.58	the legacy of Harriet Tubman,
728.58	every single year.
732.26	And we know that we are Harriet,
734.22	and we know that there is a Harriet
734.22	in every community in America.
738.38	VG: We also know that there's a Harriet
738.38	in every community across the globe,
742.06	and that they could learn
742.06	from our Tubman Doctrine,
744.86	as we call it, the four steps.
747.34	Imagine the possibilities
749.06	beyond the neighborhoods
749.06	of Oakland and Newark,
751.78	to the women working
751.78	rice fields in Vietnam,
753.94	tea fields in Sri Lanka,
755.54	the women on the
755.54	mountainsides in Guatemala,
757.9	the indigenous reservations
757.9	throughout the vast plains of the Dakotas.
761.74	We believe that women walking
763.3	and talking together
763.3	to solve their problems
765.74	is a global solution.
768.38	TMD: And I'll leave you with this,
770.06	because we also believe it can become
770.06	the center of social justice again.
773.74	Vanessa and I were in Fort Lauderdale.
775.62	We had an organizer training,
777.06	and I was leaving
777.06	and I got on the airplane,
779.7	and I saw someone I knew, so I waved,
781.54	and as I'm waiting in that long line
781.54	that you guys know,
784.22	waiting for people
784.22	to put their stuff away,
786.26	I looked back and I realized I didn't
786.26	know the woman but I recognized her.
789.98	And so I blew her a kiss
789.98	because it was Sybrina Fulton,
793.78	Trayvon Martin's mom,
795.02	"and she whispered ""thank you"" back to me."
798.82	And I can't help but wonder
798.82	what would happen
801.34	if there were groups of women
801.34	walking on Trayvon's block that day,
805.22	or what would happen
805.22	in the South Side of Chicago every day
808.38	if there were groups of women
808.38	and mothers and aunts and cousins
812.06	walking,
813.3	or along the polluted rivers
813.3	of Flint, Michigan.
816.82	I believe that walking
816.82	can transform our communities,
819.86	because it's already starting to.
821.94	VG: We believe that
821.94	the personal is political.
824.58	Our walking is for healing,
824.58	for joy, for fresh air,
827.38	quiet time, to connect
827.38	and disconnect, to worship.
831.26	But it's also walking
831.26	so we can be healthy enough
834.3	to stand on the front lines
834.3	for change in our communities,
838.46	and it is our call to action
838.46	to every black woman listening,
842.14	every black woman in earshot of our voice,
844.46	every black woman who you know.
846.02	Think about it: the woman working
846.02	front desk reception at your job,
849.22	the woman who delivers
849.22	your mail, your neighbor --
851.62	our call to action to them,
851.62	to join us on the front lines
855.1	for change in your community.
857.74	TMD: And I'll bring us back to this moment
859.82	and why it's so important
859.82	for my dear, dear friend Vanessa and I.
863.02	It's because it's not always easy for us,
865.02	and in fact, we have both seen
865.02	really, really dark days,
869.14	from the hate speech to the summer
869.14	of police brutality and violence
872.82	that we saw last year,
875.02	to even losing one of our walkers,
876.82	Sandy Bland, who died in police custody.
881.7	But the most courageous thing
881.7	we do every day is we practice faith
885.26	that goes beyond the facts,
886.62	and we put feet to our prayers
886.62	every single day,
890.46	and when we get overwhelmed,
892.14	we think of the words of people
892.14	like Sonia Sanchez, a poet laureate,
895.54	"who says, ""Morgan, where is your fire?"
897.94	Where is the fire that burned
897.94	holes through slave ships
900.58	to make us breathe?
901.82	Where is the fire
901.82	that turned guts into chitlins,
904.18	that took rhythms and make jazz,
905.98	that took sit-ins and marches
905.98	and made us jump boundaries and barriers?
909.66	"You've got to find it and pass it on."""
912.34	So this is us finding our fire
912.34	and passing it on to you.
915.74	So please, stand with us,
918.1	walk with us as we rally a million women
920.74	to reclaim the streets
920.74	of the 50 highest need communities
923.66	in this country.
925.06	We thank you so much for this opportunity.
927.46	(Applause)
