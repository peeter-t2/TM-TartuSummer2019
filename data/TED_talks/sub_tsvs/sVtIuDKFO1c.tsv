13.1	Getting a college education
15.145	is a 20-year investment.
18.22	When you're growing up poor,
19.9	you're not accustomed
19.9	to thinking that far ahead.
22.86	Instead, you're thinking about
22.86	where you're going to get your next meal
26.22	and how your family
26.22	is going to pay rent that month.
29.1	Besides, my parents
29.1	and my friends' parents
32.26	seemed to be doing just fine
32.26	driving taxis and working as janitors.
36.74	It wasn't until I was a teenager
38.66	when I realized I didn't
38.66	want to do those things.
41.94	By then, I was two-thirds of the way
41.94	through my education,
45.58	and it was almost too late
45.58	to turn things around.
49.5	When you grow up poor,
49.5	you want to be rich.
52.62	I was no different.
54.42	I'm the second-oldest of seven,
56.18	and was raised by a single mother
56.18	on government aid
58.62	in Queens, New York.
60.54	By virtue of growing up low-income,
62.5	my siblings and I went
62.5	to some of New York City's
64.86	most struggling public schools.
67.02	I had over 60 absences
67.02	when I was in seventh grade,
71.1	because I didn't feel like going to class.
73.7	My high school had
73.7	a 55 percent graduation rate,
76.779	and even worse,
78.1	only 20 percent of the kids graduating
80.42	were college-ready.
82.78	When I actually did make it to college,
84.94	I told my friend Brennan
86.38	how our teachers would always ask us
86.38	to raise our hands
90.1	if we were going to college.
93.22	I was taken aback when Brennan said,
94.98	"""Karim, I've never been asked"
94.98	"that question before."""
98.54	"It was always, ""What college"
98.54	"are you going to?"""
101.54	Just the way that question is phrased
103.5	made it unacceptable for him
103.5	not to have gone to college.
107.78	Nowadays I get asked a different question.
110.5	"""How were you able to make it out?"""
113.58	For years I said I was lucky,
117.14	but it's not just luck.
119.1	When my older brother and I
119.1	graduated from high school
121.7	at the very same time
122.98	and he later dropped out
122.98	of a two-year college,
125.22	I wanted to understand why he dropped out
127.7	and I kept studying.
130.06	It wasn't until I got to Cornell
130.06	as a Presidential Research Scholar
133.46	that I started to learn about
133.46	the very real educational consequences
137.22	of being raised by a single mother
137.22	on government aid
140.019	and attending the schools that I did.
142.739	That's when my older brother's trajectory
142.739	began to make complete sense to me.
148.1	I also learned that our most admirable
148.1	education reformers,
151.5	people like Arne Duncan,
151.5	the former US Secretary of Education,
155.18	or Wendy Kopp, the founder
155.18	of Teach For America,
157.9	had never attended an inner city
157.9	public school like I had.
161.34	So much of our education reform
161.34	is driven by a sympathetic approach,
165.18	where people are saying,
166.46	"""Let's go and help"
166.46	these poor inner city kids,
169.5	"or these poor black and Latino kids,"""
172.14	instead of an empathetic approach,
174.54	where someone like me, who had grown up
174.54	in this environment, could say,
177.98	"""I know the adversities that you're facing"
180.22	"and I want to help you overcome them."""
183.38	Today when I get questions
183.38	about how I made it out,
186.1	I share that one of the biggest reasons
188.62	is that I wasn't ashamed to ask for help.
191.66	In a typical middle class
191.66	or affluent household,
194.3	if a kid is struggling,
196.1	there's a good chance that a parent
196.1	or a teacher will come to their rescue
200.06	even if they don't ask for help.
202.02	However, if that same kid
202.02	is growing up poor
204.18	and doesn't ask for help,
206.06	there's a good chance
206.06	that no one will help them.
208.7	There are virtually
208.7	no social safety nets available.
212.98	So seven years ago,
214.38	I started to reform
214.38	our public education system
217.22	shaped by my firsthand perspective.
220.78	And I started with summer school.
223.78	Research tells us that two-thirds
223.78	of the achievement gap,
227.14	which is the disparity
227.14	in educational attainment
229.5	between rich kids and poor kids
231.7	or black kids and white kids,
233.86	could be directly attributed
233.86	to the summer learning loss.
237.46	In low-income neighborhoods,
237.46	kids forget almost three months
240.3	of what they learned
240.3	during the school year
242.38	over the summer.
243.74	They return to school in the fall,
245.38	and their teachers
245.38	spend another two months
247.46	reteaching them old material.
248.9	That's five months.
250.42	The school year in the United States
250.42	is only 10 months.
253.06	If kids lose five months of learning
253.06	every single year,
255.7	that's half of their education.
257.94	Half.
259.9	If kids were in school over the summer,
259.9	then they couldn't regress,
263.82	but traditional summer school
263.82	is poorly designed.
266.74	For kids it feels like punishment,
268.82	and for teachers
268.82	it feels like babysitting.
272.14	But how can we expect principals
272.14	to execute an effective summer program
276.18	when the school year
276.18	ends the last week of June
278.66	and then summer school starts
278.66	just one week later?
281.78	There just isn't enough time
281.78	to find the right people,
284.38	sort out the logistics,
285.66	and design an engaging curriculum
285.66	that excites kids and teachers.
291.58	But what if we created a program
291.58	over the summer
295.58	that empowered teachers
295.58	as teaching coaches
299.3	to develop aspiring educators?
302.54	What if we empowered
302.54	college-educated role models
305.3	as teaching fellows
307.38	to help kids realize
307.38	their college ambitions?
309.94	What if empowered high-achieving kids
312.22	as mentors to tutor their younger peers
315.66	and inspire them
315.66	to invest in their education?
319.46	What if we empowered all kids as scholars,
323.22	asked them what colleges
323.22	they were going to,
326.46	designed a summer school
326.46	they want to attend
330.22	to completely eliminate
330.22	the summer learning loss
332.78	and close two-thirds
332.78	of the achievement gap?
337.1	By this summer, my team will have served
337.1	over 4,000 low-income children,
341.74	trained over 300 aspiring teachers
344.7	and created more than 1,000 seasonal jobs
347.02	across some of New York City's
347.02	most disadvantaged neighborhoods.
350.82	(Applause)
356.66	And our kids are succeeding.
359.02	Two years of independent evaluations
361.02	tell us that our kids
361.02	eliminate the summer learning loss
363.98	and make growth of one month in math
366.18	and two months in reading.
368.02	So instead of returning to school
368.02	in the fall three months behind,
371.54	they now go back four months ahead in math
375.38	and five months ahead in reading.
377.46	(Applause)
384.58	Ten years ago, if you would have told me
386.54	that I'd graduate in the top 10 percent
386.54	of my class from an Ivy League institution
390.74	and have an opportunity to make a dent
390.74	on our public education system
394.74	just by tackling two months
394.74	of the calendar year,
398.5	I would have said,
400.26	"""Nah. No way."""
403.54	What's even more exciting
405.06	is that if we can prevent
405.06	five months of lost time
408.26	just by redesigning two months,
411.3	imagine the possibilities
411.3	that we can unlock
413.98	by tackling the rest of the calendar year.
417.98	Thank you.
419.22	(Applause)
