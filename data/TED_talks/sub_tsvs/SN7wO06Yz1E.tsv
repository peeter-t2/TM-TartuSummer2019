92.262	Julie Taymor: Thank you.
92.262	Thank you very much.
94.469	That's a few samples of the theater, opera
97.186	and films that I have done
97.186	over the last 20 years.
100.528	But what I'd like to begin with right now
102.566	is to take you back to a moment
104.469	that I went through in Indonesia,
106.934	which is a seminal moment in my life
109.071	and, like all myths,
111.151	these stories need to be retold
113.406	and told, lest we forget them.
115.905	And when I'm in the turbulent
115.905	times, as we know,
118.929	that I am right now, through the crucible
121.317	and the fire of transformation,
123.508	which is what all of you do, actually.
126.126	Anybody who creates knows
126.126	there's that point where
129.25	it hasn't quite become
129.25	the phoenix or the burnt char.
134.359	(Laughter)
136.457	And I am right there on the edge,
139.362	which I'll tell you about, another story.
141.339	I want to go back to Indonesia
142.792	where I was about 21, 22
142.792	years, a long time ago,
146.476	on a fellowship.
147.7	And I found myself, after two years there
150.63	and performing and learning,
150.63	on the island of Bali,
153.979	on the edge of a crater, Gunung Batur.
157.806	And I was in a village where there was
160.823	an initiation ceremony for the young men,
163.615	a rite of passage.
165.179	Little did I know that it
165.179	was mine as well.
167.731	And as I sat in this temple square
170.19	under this gigantic beringin banyan tree,
173.19	in the dark, there was no
173.19	electricity, just the full moon,
178.027	down in this empty square,
180.083	and I heard the most beautiful sounds,
182.233	like a Charles Ives concert
184.064	as I listened to the gamelan music
186.107	from all the different villagers that came
188.156	for this once-every-five-years ceremony.
191.554	And I thought I was alone
191.554	in the dark under this tree.
195.149	And all of a sudden, out of the dark,
197.98	from the other end of the square,
199.864	I saw the glint of mirrors
199.864	lit by the moon.
203.772	And these 20 old men who I'd seen before
207.331	all of a sudden stood up in these
207.331	full warrior costumes
212.633	with the headdress and the spears,
215.118	and no one was in the square,
215.118	and I was hidden in the shadows.
219.48	No one was there, and they came out,
221.841	and they did this incredible dance.
225.48	"""Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhahahahaha."""
229.172	And they moved their bodies
229.172	and they came forward,
232.345	and the lights bounced off these costumes.
235.147	And I've been in theater
235.147	since I was 11 years old,
238.563	and performing, creating, and I went,
241.777	"""Who are they performing for"
243.92	with these elaborate costumes,
246.267	"these extraordinary headdresses?"""
248.294	And I realized that they were
248.294	performing for God,
253.081	whatever that means.
255.792	But somehow, it didn't
255.792	matter about the publicity.
259.38	There was no money involved.
261.631	It wasn't going to be written down.
261.631	It was no news.
264.851	And there were these incredible artists
266.997	that felt for me like an eternity
266.997	as they performed.
270.498	The next moment,
272.583	as soon as they finished
272.583	and disappeared into the shadows,
276.643	a young man with a propane
276.643	lantern came on,
279.149	hung it up on a tree, set up a curtain.
281.4	The village square was filled
281.4	with hundreds of people.
284.861	And they put on an opera all night long.
287.399	Human beings needed the light.
289.659	They needed the light to see.
292.296	So what I gained and gathered
292.296	from this incredible,
295.944	seminal moment in my life
295.944	as a young artist
298.556	was that you must be true
301.879	to what you believe as an artist
301.879	all the way through,
305.951	but you also have to be aware
309.49	that the audience is out there
309.49	in our lives at this time,
312.979	and they also need the light.
314.384	And it's this incredible balance
316.547	that I think that we walk
318.296	when we are creating something
318.296	that is breaking ground,
321.629	that's trying to do something
321.629	you've never seen before,
324.283	that imaginary world
325.969	where you actually don't know
325.969	where you're going to end up,
329.346	that's the fine line
329.346	on the edge of a crater
332.112	that I have walked my whole life.
334.742	What I would like to do now is to tell you
337.29	a little bit
339.096	about how I work.
339.096	"Let's take ""The Lion King."""
341.953	You saw many examples of my work up there,
344.205	but it's one that people know.
346.15	I start with the notion of the ideograph.
348.849	An ideograph is like a brush
348.849	painting, a Japanese brush painting.
352.224	Three strokes, you get
352.224	the whole bamboo forest.
355.733	"I go to the concept of ""The Lion King"""
358.264	"and I say, ""What is the essence of it?"
360.332	What is the abstraction?
361.968	If I were to reduce this entire story
365.229	"into one image, what would it be?"""
367.97	The circle. The circle. It's so obvious.
370.924	The circle of life. The
370.924	circle of Mufasa's mask.
374.901	The circle that, when we come
374.901	to Act II and there's a drought,
379.441	how do you express drought?
380.92	It's a circle of silk on the floor
384.079	that disappears into the hole
384.079	in the stage floor.
388.133	The circle of life comes in the wheels
390.762	of the gazelles that leap.
393.21	And you see the mechanics.
394.932	And being a theater person, what I know
394.932	and love about the theater
398.31	is that when the audience comes in
400.005	and they suspend their disbelief,
401.799	when you see men walking or women walking
404.634	with a platter of grass on their heads,
406.531	you know it's the savanna.
408.147	You don't question that.
409.691	I love the apparent truth of theater.
412.175	I love that people are willing
412.175	to fill in the blanks.
415.772	The audience is willing to say,
417.792	"""Oh, I know that's not a real sun."
420.792	You took pieces of sticks.
423.1	You added silk to the bottom.
425.195	You suspended these pieces. You
425.195	let it fall flat on the floor.
428.899	And as it rises with the strings,
428.899	I see that it's a sun.
433.302	But the beauty of it
433.302	is that it's just silk and sticks.
437.709	And in a way, that is what makes
437.709	it spiritual.
442.261	That's what moves you.
443.706	It's not the actual literal
443.706	sunrise that's coming.
447.922	It's the art of it.
449.453	So in the theater, as much
449.453	as the story is critical
454.813	and the book and the language,
456.718	the telling of the story, how it's told,
461.369	the mechanics, the methods that you use,
464.987	is equal to the story itself.
467.586	And I'm one who loves
467.586	high tech and low tech.
470.924	So I could go from --
472.723	For instance, I'll show you
472.723	"some ""Spider-Man"" later,"
475.224	these incredible machines
475.224	that move people along.
477.8	But the fact is, without the dancer
480.166	who knows how to use his body
480.166	and swing on those wires,
482.919	it's nothing.
484.706	So now I'm going to show you
487.615	some clips from the other big
487.615	project of my life this year,
491.933	"""The Tempest."""
492.975	"It's a movie. I did ""The"
492.975	"Tempest"" on a stage three times"
497.068	in the theater since 1984, '86,
500.305	and I love the play.
502.509	I did it always with a male Prospero.
505.035	And all of a sudden, I thought,
506.697	"""Well, who am I gonna"
506.697	get to play Prospero?
508.783	Why not Helen Mirren?
508.783	"She's a great actor. Why not?"""
512.505	And this material really did work
512.505	for a woman equally as well.
515.765	So now, let's take a look
515.765	at some of the images
518.86	"from ""The Tempest."""
520.853	(Music)
537.22	(Video) Prospera: Hast thou, spirit, performed
537.22	to the point the tempest that I bade thee?
541.483	Ariel: I boarded the king's ship.
541.483	In every cabin, I flamed amazement.
549.664	Prospera: At first sight,
549.664	they have changed eyes.
552.62	Miranda: Do you love me?
553.815	Ferdinand: Beyond all limit.
555.191	HM: They are both in either's powers.
557.783	Trinculo: Misery acquaints
557.783	a man with strange bedfellows.
562.914	(Music)
566.156	Looking for business, governor?
569.633	Caliban: Hast thou not
569.633	dropped from heaven?
571.705	Stephano: Out of the moon,
571.705	I do assure thee.
574.19	Prospera: Caliban!
576.187	Caliban: This island is mine.
578.452	Prospera: For this, be sure,
578.452	tonight thou shalt have cramps.
581.997	Antonio: Here lies your brother no
581.997	better than the earth he lies upon.
585.506	Sebastian: Draw thy sword.
587.305	And I, the king, shall love thee.
590.914	Prospera: I will plague
590.914	them all, even to roaring.
598.133	Ariel: I have made you mad.
608.874	Prospera: We are such stuff
608.874	as dreams are made on.
611.919	and our little life
611.919	is rounded with a sleep.
616.13	(Music)
621.455	JT: Okay.
624.305	(Applause)
628.279	So I went from theater,
628.279	"doing ""The Tempest"""
630.707	on the stage in a very
630.707	low-budget production
633.031	many years ago,
634.669	and I love the play, and I also think
637.114	it's Shakespeare's last play,
639.138	and it really lends itself,
639.138	as you can see, to cinema.
642.818	But I'm just going to give
642.818	you a little example about
645.366	how one stages it in theater
647.271	and then how one takes
647.271	that same idea or story
651.332	and moves it into cinema.
654.324	The ideograph that I talked
654.324	to you about before,
657.42	"what is it for ""The Tempest""?"
659.531	What, if I were to boil it down,
662.357	would be the one image that I could
664.67	hang my hat on for this?
666.917	And it was the sand castle,
669.205	the idea of nurture versus nature,
672.345	that we build these civilizations --
674.8	she speaks about it at the end,
674.8	Helen Mirren's Prospera --
677.755	we build them, but under nature,
677.755	under the grand tempest,
683.228	these cloud-capped towers, these
683.228	gorgeous palaces will fade
688.723	and there will -- leave not a rack behind.
692.946	So in the theater, I started the play,
695.575	it was a black sand rake, white cyc,
698.637	and there was a little girl,
698.637	Miranda, on the horizon,
701.562	building a drip castle, a sand castle.
704.23	And as she was there
704.23	on the edge of that stage,
707.67	two stagehands all in black
711.031	with watering cans ran along the top
715.535	and started to pour water
715.535	on the sand castle,
720.162	and the sand castle
720.162	started to drip and sink,
722.932	but before it did,
724.331	the audience saw
724.331	the black-clad stagehands.
728.571	The medium was apparent. It was banal.
728.571	We saw it.
733.158	But as they started to pour the water,
736.141	the light changed from showing
736.141	you the black-clad stagehands
739.873	to focusing, this rough magic
739.873	that we do in theater,
743.187	it focused right on the water itself.
746.74	And all of a sudden,
746.74	the audience's perspective changes.
750.962	It becomes something magically large.
754.468	It becomes the rainstorm.
757.1	The masked actors,
757.1	the puppeteers, they disappear,
760.744	and the audience makes
760.744	that leap into this world,
763.944	"into this imaginary world of ""The"
763.944	"Tempest"" actually happening."
768.267	Now the difference
769.696	when I went and did it in the cinema,
772.299	I started the actual movie
774.683	with a close-up of a sand
774.683	castle, a black sand castle,
779.965	and what cinema can do is,
781.803	by using camera, perspective,
785.259	and also long shots and close-ups,
788.001	it started on a close-up
788.001	of the sand castle,
790.32	and as it pulled away,
792.203	you saw that it was a miniature
792.203	sitting in the palm
795.237	of the girl's hands.
797.14	And so I could play with the medium,
798.968	and why I move from one medium to another
801.92	is to be able to do this.
803.403	"Now I'm going to take you to ""Spider-Man."""

951.915	What the hell are we doing
951.915	up there on that stage?
954.757	Well, one last story, very quickly.
957.419	After I was in that village,
957.419	I crossed the lake,
960.289	and I saw that the volcano was erupting
963.378	on the other side, Gunung Batur,
965.131	and there was a dead volcano
965.131	next to the live volcano.
968.216	I didn't think I'd be
968.216	swallowed by the volcano,
970.479	and I am here.
971.823	But it's very easy to climb up, is it not?
975.76	You hold on to the roots,
977.345	you put your foot in the little rocks
980.545	and climb up there,
980.545	and you get to the top,
983.127	and I was with a good
983.127	friend who was an actor,
985.417	"and we said, ""Let's go up there."
987.437	Let's see if we can come close to the edge
989.485	"of that live volcano."""
991.621	And we climbed up and we got
991.621	to the very top,
994.473	and we're on the edge, on this precipice,
996.978	Roland disappears into the sulfur smoke
999.391	at the volcano at the other end,
1001.328	and I'm up there alone
1003.17	on this incredible precipice.
1005.906	Did you hear the lyrics?
1007.527	I'm on the precipice looking down
1009.853	into a dead volcano to my left.
1012.164	To my right is sheer shale.
1012.164	It's coming off.
1015.992	I'm in thongs and sarongs.
1015.992	It was many years ago.
1019.76	And no hiking boots.
1021.385	And he's disappeared, this
1021.385	mad French gypsy actor,
1025.344	off in the smoke, and I realize,
1028.648	I can't go back the way that I've come.
1028.648	I can't.
1032.576	So I throw away my camera.
1032.576	I throw away my thongs,
1037.257	and I looked at the line
1037.257	straight in front of me,
1040.486	and I got down on all fours like a cat,
1044.119	and I held with my knees to either side
1047.142	of this line in front of me,
1049.535	for 30 yards or 30 feet, I don't know.
1052.577	The wind was massively blowing,
1055.29	and the only way I could
1055.29	get to the other side
1058.72	was to look at the line
1058.72	straight in front of me.
1061.163	I know you've all been there.
1063.166	I'm in the crucible right now.
1065.139	It's my trial by fire.
1067.003	It's my company's trials by fire.
1069.333	We survive because our theme
1069.333	"song is ""Rise Above."""
1073.59	Boy falls from the sky, rise above.
1076.731	It's right there in the palm

1079.145	of all of my company's hands.
1080.772	I have beautiful collaborators,
1080.772	and we as creators
1084.34	only get there all together.
1086.351	I know you understand that.
1088.54	And you just stay going forward,
1090.965	and then you see this extraordinary thing
1093.606	in front of your eyes.
1095.152	Thank you.
