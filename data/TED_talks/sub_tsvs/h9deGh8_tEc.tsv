12.917	So, I teach college students
12.917	about inequality and race in education,
17.761	and I like to leave my office open
17.761	to any of my students
20.85	who might just want to see me to chat.
23.405	And a few semesters ago,
24.976	one of my more cheerful
24.976	students, Mahari,
27.905	actually came to see me
29.326	and mentioned that he was feeling
29.326	a bit like an outcast because he's black.
34.001	He had just transferred to NYU
34.001	from a community college
36.898	on a merit scholarship,
38.684	and turns out,
40.542	only about five percent
40.542	of students at NYU are black.
43.848	And so I started to remember
45.301	that I know that feeling
45.301	of being an outsider
47.854	in your own community.
49.558	It's partially what drew me to my work.
51.801	At my university,
53.056	I'm one of the few
53.056	faculty members of color,
55.477	and growing up, I experienced
55.477	my family's social mobility,
59.326	moving out of apartments
59.326	into a nice house,
62.573	but in an overwhelmingly
62.573	white neighborhood.
65.293	I was 12,
66.467	and kids would say that were surprised
66.467	that I didn't smell like curry.
70.443	(Laughter)
71.69	That's because school is in the morning,
73.659	and I had Eggo waffles for breakfast.
75.555	(Laughter)
77.184	Curry is for dinner.
78.437	(Laughter)
80.412	So when Mahari was leaving,
81.817	I asked him how he was coping
81.817	with feeling isolated.
84.833	And he said that despite feeling lonely,
87.082	he just threw himself at his work,
89.182	that he built strategies around his grit
91.659	and his desire to be successful.
93.945	A mentor of mine is actually
93.945	Dr. Angela Duckworth,
96.874	the psychologist at UPenn who has defined
96.874	this stick-to-itiveness of grit
101.765	"as being ""the perseverance"
101.765	"and passion for long-term goals."""
105.469	Angela's book has become a bestseller,
107.67	and schools across the country,
109.705	particularly charter schools,
111.444	have become interested in citing
111.444	"""grit"" as a core value."
115.32	But sometimes grit isn't enough,
117.33	especially in education.
119.254	So when Mahari was leaving my office,
121.146	I worried that he might need
121.146	something more specific
123.848	to combat the challenges
123.848	that he mentioned to me.
126.76	As a sociologist,
126.76	I also study achievement,
130.053	but from a slightly different perspective.
132.256	I research students who have overcome
132.256	immense obstacles
135.453	related to their background.
137.101	Students from low-income,
138.757	often single-parent households,
140.818	students who have been homeless,
140.818	incarcerated or perhaps undocumented,
145.679	or some who have struggled
145.679	with substance abuse
148.132	or lived through violent or sexual trauma.
151.319	So let me tell you about two
151.319	of the grittiest people I've met.
155.077	Tyrique was raised by a single mother,
157.775	and then after high school,
157.775	he fell in with the wrong crowd.
160.653	He got arrested for armed robbery.
162.569	But in prison, he started to work hard.
165.051	He took college credit courses,
166.901	so when he got out,
166.901	he was able to get a master's,
169.571	and today he's a manager at a nonprofit.
172.782	Vanessa had to move around a lot as a kid,
175.486	from the Lower East Side
175.486	to Staten Island to the Bronx.
178.877	She was raised primarily
178.877	by her extended family,
181.872	because her own mother
181.872	had a heroin addiction.
184.812	Yet at 15,
185.986	Vanessa had to drop out of school,
187.63	and she had a son of her own.
189.313	But eventually, she was able
189.313	to go to community college,
192.827	get her associate's,
194.346	then go to an elite college
194.346	to finish her bachelor's.
198.261	So some people might
198.261	hear these stories and say,
200.809	"""Yes, those two definitely have grit."
202.842	They basically pulled themselves up
202.842	"by the bootstraps."""
206.05	But that's an incomplete picture,
208.512	because what's more important
210.057	is that they had factors in their lives
210.057	that helped to influence their agency,
214.182	or their specific capacity
215.882	to actually overcome
215.882	the obstacles that they were facing
219.47	and navigate the system
219.47	given their circumstances.
223.176	So, allow me to elaborate.
224.965	In prison, Tyrique
224.965	was actually aimless at first,
228.322	as a 22-year-old on Rikers Island.
230.917	This is until an older detainee
230.917	took him aside
234.243	and asked him to help
234.243	with the youth program.
236.808	And in mentoring youth,
238.275	he started to see his own mistakes
238.275	and possibilities in the teens.
242.365	This is what got him interested
242.365	in taking college-credit courses.
245.963	And when he got out,
247.167	he got a job with Fortune Society,
249.405	where many executives are people
249.405	who have been formerly incarcerated.
253.543	So then he was able to get
253.543	a master's in social work,
256.234	and today, he even lectures
256.234	at Columbia about prison reform.
261.057	And Vanessa ...
262.573	well, after the birth of her son,
264.661	she happened to find a program
264.661	called Vocational Foundation
267.965	that gave her 20 dollars biweekly,
270.005	a MetroCard
271.187	and her first experiences with a computer.
273.397	These simple resources
273.397	are what helped her get her GED,
276.765	but then she suffered
276.765	from a very serious kidney failure,
279.644	which was particularly problematic
279.644	because she was only born with one kidney.
283.732	She spent 10 years on dialysis
283.732	waiting for a successful transplant.
288.423	After that,
289.752	her mentors at community college
289.752	had kept in touch with her,
292.598	and so she was able to go,
294.259	and they put her in an honors program.
296.382	And that's the pathway
296.382	that allowed her to become accepted
299.147	to one of the most elite colleges
299.147	for women in the country,
302.51	and she received her bachelor's at 36,
305.011	setting an incredible example
305.011	for her young son.
308.782	What these stories primarily indicate
308.782	is that teaching is social
312.995	and benefits from social scaffolding.
315.384	There were factors
315.384	pushing these two in one direction,
318.218	but through tailored
318.218	mentorship and opportunities,
321.091	they were able to reflect
321.091	on their circumstances
323.639	and resist negative influences.
326.175	They also learned simple skills
326.175	like developing a network,
329.709	or asking for help --
331.374	things many of us in this room can forget
331.374	that we have needed from time to time,
336.202	or can take for granted.
338.251	And when we think of people like this,
340.107	we should only think of them
340.107	as exceptional, but not as exceptions.
344.652	Thinking of them as exceptions absolves us
347.501	of the collective responsibility
347.501	to help students in similar situations.
352.274	When Presidents Bush, Obama
352.274	and now even Trump,
355.902	have called education
355.902	"""the civil rights issue of our time,"""
359.624	perhaps we should treat it that way.
362.119	If schools were able to think
362.119	about the agency that their students have
365.855	and bring to the table
365.855	when they push them,
368.372	what students learn can become
368.372	more relevant to their lives,
371.395	and then they can tap into those internal
371.395	reservoirs of grit and character.
377.09	So this here --
378.653	My student Mahari
380.392	got accepted to law school
380.392	with scholarships,
383.641	and not to brag,
385.181	but I did write one of his letters
385.181	of recommendation.
387.728	(Laughter)
389.34	And even though I know hard work
389.34	is what got him this achievement,
393.322	I've seen him find
393.322	his voice along the way,
395.453	which as someone who's grown up
395.453	a little bit shy and awkward,
399.318	I know it takes time and support.
401.655	So even though
401.655	he will rely a lot on his grit
404.814	to get him through
404.814	that first-year law school grind,
408.013	I'll be there as a mentor for him,
410.442	check in with him from time to time,
412.498	maybe take him out to get some curry ...
414.506	(Laughter)
415.617	so that he can keep growing his agency
415.617	to succeed even more.
419.392	Thank you.
420.567	(Applause)
