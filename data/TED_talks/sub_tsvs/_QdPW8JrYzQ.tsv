12.809	A few years ago,
13.984	I got one of those spam emails.
17.468	And it managed
17.468	to get through my spam filter.
19.596	I'm not quite sure how,
19.596	but it turned up in my inbox,
22.176	and it was from a guy
22.176	called Solomon Odonkoh.
24.349	(Laughter)
26.159	I know.
27.334	(Laughter)
28.588	It went like this:
29.772	"it said, ""Hello James Veitch,"
31.414	I have an interesting business proposal
31.414	"I want to share with you, Solomon."""
36.246	Now, my hand was kind of hovering
36.246	on the delete button, right?
39.183	I was looking at my phone.
39.183	I thought, I could just delete this.
42.442	Or I could do what I think
42.442	we've all always wanted to do.
46.631	(Laughter)
50.541	"And I said, ""Solomon,"
50.541	"Your email intrigues me."""
52.774	(Laughter)
55.5	(Applause)
60.5	And the game was afoot.
65.214	"He said, ""Dear James Veitch,"
65.214	"We shall be shipping Gold to you."""
68.199	(Laughter)
70.302	"""You will earn 10%"
70.302	"of any gold you distributes."""
73.223	(Laughter)
75.307	So I knew I was dealing
75.307	with a professional.
77.382	(Laughter)
82.408	"I said, ""How much is it worth?"""
85.058	"He said, ""We will start"
85.058	"with smaller quantity,"" --"
87.582	I was like, aww --
88.758	"and then he said, ""of 25 kgs."
91.576	(Laughter)
94.969	"The worth should be about $2.5 million."""
99.536	"I said, ""Solomon, if we're"
99.536	going to do it, let's go big.
102.235	(Applause)
110.286	I can handle it.
110.286	"How much gold do you have?"""
114.215	(Laughter)
117.761	"He said, ""It is not a matter"
117.761	of how much gold I have,
120.385	what matters is
120.385	your capability of handling.
122.46	We can start with 50 kgs
122.46	"as trial shipment."""
124.707	"I said, ""50 kgs?"
126.602	There's no point doing this at all
128.269	unless you're shipping
128.269	"at least a metric ton."""
130.523	(Laughter)
131.742	(Applause)
135.401	"He said, ""What do you do for a living?"""
137.348	(Laughter)
140.283	"I said, ""I'm a hedge fund"
140.283	"executive bank manager."""
142.649	(Laughter)
147.243	This isn't the first time
147.243	I've shipped bullion, my friend,
149.993	no no no.
152.989	Then I started to panic.
154.164	"I was like, ""Where are you based?"""
155.816	I don't know about you,
157.022	but I think if we're going
157.022	via the postal service,
159.414	it ought to be signed for.
160.746	"That's a lot of gold."""
162.666	"He said, ""It will not be easy"
162.666	to convince my company
165.127	"to do larger quantity shipment."""
166.861	"I said, ""Solomon, I'm completely"
166.861	with you on this one.
169.413	I'm putting together a visual for you
169.413	to take into the board meeting.
172.883	"Hold tight."""
174.087	(Laughter)
181.009	This is what I sent Solomon.
183.205	(Laughter)
185.356	(Applause)
191.829	I don't know if we have
191.829	any statisticians in the house,
194.908	but there's definitely something going on.
196.941	(Laughter)
199.17	"I said, ""Solomon, attached to this email"
199.17	you'll find a helpful chart.
203.281	I've had one of my assistants
203.281	run the numbers.
205.598	(Laughter)
207.408	We're ready for shipping
207.408	"as much gold as possible."""
210.254	There's always a moment where they try
210.254	to tug your heartstrings,
213.329	and this was it for Solomon.
214.695	"He said, ""I will be so much happy"
214.695	if the deal goes well,
217.346	because I'm going to get
217.346	"a very good commission as well."""
220.045	"And I said, ""That's amazing,"
220.045	"What are you going to spend your cut on?"""
223.363	"And he said, ""On RealEstate,"
223.363	"what about you?"""
226.133	I thought about it for a long time.
230.925	"And I said, ""One word;"
233.632	"Hummus."""
234.807	(Laughter)
240.261	"""It's going places."
241.435	(Laughter)
243.395	I was in Sainsbury's the other day
245.065	and there were like
247.142	Also you can cut up carrots,
247.142	and you can dip them.
250.063	"Have you ever done that, Solomon?"""
251.943	(Laughter)
254.458	"He said, ""I have to go bed now."""
256.014	(Laughter)
258.917	(Applause)
261.8	"""Till morrow."
264.407	"Have sweet dream."""
265.583	I didn't know what to say!
267.643	"I said, ""Bonsoir"
267.643	"my golden nugget, bonsoir."""
270.554	(Laughter)
273.323	Guys, you have to understand,
273.323	this had been going for, like, weeks,
276.499	albeit hitherto the greatest
276.499	weeks of my life,
278.674	but I had to knock it on the head.
280.325	It was getting a bit out of hand.
281.929	"Friends were saying, ""James,"
281.929	"do you want to come for a drink?"""
284.905	"I was like, ""I can't, I'm expecting"
284.905	"an email about some gold."""
287.945	So I figured I had
287.945	to knock it on the head.
290.013	I had to take it
290.013	to a ridiculous conclusion.
292.093	So I concocted a plan.
293.269	"I said, ""Solomon,"
293.269	I'm concerned about security.
295.645	When we email each other,
296.876	"we need to use a code."""
300.582	And he agreed.
301.757	(Laughter)
303.169	"I said, ""Solomon, I spent all night"
303.169	coming up with this code
306.082	we need to use
306.082	in all further correspondence:
308.211	Lawyer: Gummy Bear.
313.564	Bank: Cream Egg.
316.002	Legal: Fizzy Cola Bottle.
316.002	Claim: Peanut M&amp;Ms.
318.193	Documents: Jelly Beans.
320.137	"Western Union: A Giant Gummy Lizard."""
322.305	(Laughter)
324.602	I knew these were all words
324.602	they use, right?
326.962	"I said, ""Please call me Kitkat"
326.962	"in all further correspondence."""
330.661	(Laughter)
336.002	I didn't hear back.
336.002	I thought, I've gone too far.
338.454	I've gone too far.
338.454	So I had to backpedal a little.
340.82	"I said, ""Solomon, Is the deal still on?"
344.311	"KitKat."""
345.486	(Laughter)
346.756	Because you have to be consistent.
351.208	Then I did get an email back from him.
353.098	"He said, ""The Business is on"
353.098	"and I am trying to blah blah blah ..."""
356.302	"I said, ""Dude, you have to use the code!"""
361.478	What followed is the greatest email
361.478	I've ever received.
364.09	(Laughter)
367.675	I'm not joking, this is what
367.675	turned up in my inbox.
370.939	This was a good day.
373.224	"""The business is on."
376.065	I am trying to raise the balance
376.065	for the Gummy Bear --
378.708	(Laughter)
383.485	so he can submit all the needed
383.485	Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans
386.734	to the Creme Egg,
389.791	for the Peanut M&amp;Ms process to start.
392.118	(Laughter)
393.94	Send 1,500 pounds
396.093	"via a Giant Gummy Lizard."""
398.506	(Applause)
409.392	And that was so much fun, right,
411.821	that it got me thinking:
413.195	like, what would happen if I just spent
413.195	as much time as could
416.13	replying to as many
416.13	scam emails as I could?
420.145	And that's what I've been doing
423.145	for three years
425.269	on your behalf.
426.574	(Laughter)
428.993	(Applause)
432.079	Crazy stuff happens when you start
432.079	replying to scam emails.
434.974	It's really difficult,
436.149	and I highly recommend we do it.
437.751	I don't think what I'm doing is mean.
439.616	There are a lot of people
439.616	who do mean things to scammers.
442.392	All I'm doing is wasting their time.
446.894	And I think any time
446.894	they're spending with me
449.077	is time they're not spending
449.077	scamming vulnerable adults
451.698	out of their savings, right?
453.584	And if you're going to do this --
453.584	and I highly recommend you do --
457.171	get yourself a pseudonymous email address.
459.206	Don't use your own email address.
460.834	That's what I was doing at the start
460.834	and it was a nightmare.
463.712	I'd wake up in the morning
463.712	and have a thousand emails
466.292	about penis enlargements,
467.523	only one of which
467.523	was a legitimate response --
469.744	(Laughter)
471.864	to a medical question I had.
473.23	But I'll tell you what, though, guys,
475.023	I'll tell you what: any day is a good day,
475.023	any day is a good day
478.048	if you receive an email
478.048	that begins like this:
481.558	(Laughter)
484.396	"""I AM WINNIE MANDELA,"
487.094	THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA
487.094	"THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT."""
490.412	I was like, oh! -- that Winnie Mandela.
492.339	(Laughter)
493.444	I know so many.
495.546	"""I NEED TO TRANSFER 45 MILLION DOLLARS"
495.546	OUT OF THE COUNTRY
498.626	BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND
498.626	"NELSON MANDELA'S HEALTH CONDITION."""
501.42	Let that sink in.
503.864	She sent me this, which is hysterical.
506.528	(Laughter)
509.499	And this.
510.682	And this looks fairly legitimate,
510.682	this is a letter of authorization.
513.905	But to be honest, if there's nothing
513.905	written on it, it's just a shape!
517.318	(Laughter)
519.651	"I said, ""Winnie,"
519.651	I'm really sorry to hear of this.
522.017	Given that Nelson died three months ago,
524.034	I'd describe his health condition
524.034	"as fairly serious."""
526.644	(Laughter)
529.482	That's the worst health condition
529.482	you can have, not being alive.
535.373	"She said, ""KINDLY COMPLY"
535.373	WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS.
538.168	"ONE LOVE."""
539.35	(Laughter)
542.325	"I said, ""Of course. NO WOMAN, NO CRY."""
544.167	(Laughter)
547.695	(Applause)
552.701	"She said, ""MY BANKER WILL NEED"
552.701	"TRANSFER OF 3000 DOLLARS. ONE LOVE."""
555.876	(Laughter)
560.01	"I said, ""no problemo."
564.422	"I SHOT THE SHERIFF."""
569.813	[ (BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEPUTY) ]
571.717	(Laughter)
572.766	Thank you.
573.942	(Applause)
