25	I'll just take you to Bangladesh for a minute.
67	Before I tell that story, we should ask ourselves the question:
70	Why does poverty exist?
72	I mean, there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs.
77	We all live in the same planet,
80	but there's still a great deal of poverty in the world.
82	And I think -- so I want to throw a perspective that I have,
86	so that we can assess this project, or any other project, for that matter,
93	to see whether it's contributing or --
96	contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it.
98	Rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last 60 years.
103	And by and large, this has failed.
106	And you can see this book,
108	written by someone who worked in the World Bank for 20 years,
111	and he finds economic growth in this country to be elusive.
116	By and large, it did not work.
119	So the question is, why is that?
123	In my mind, there is something to learn from the history of Europe.
128	I mean, even here, yesterday I was walking across the street,
132	and they showed three bishops were executed 500 years ago,
136	right across the street from here.
138	So my point is, there's a lot of struggle has gone in Europe,
142	where citizens were empowered by technologies.
145	And they demanded authorities from --
148	to come down from their high horses.
151	And in the end, there's better bargaining
154	between the authorities and citizens,
157	and democracies, capitalism -- everything else flourished.
160	And so you can see, the real process of --
163	and this is backed up by this 500-page book --
167	that the authorities came down and citizens got up.
172	But if you look, if you have that perspective,
175	then you can see what happened in the last 60 years.
178	Aid actually did the opposite.
181	It empowered authorities,
183	and, as a result, marginalized citizens.
186	The authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen
189	so that they could tax people
192	and make more money for to run their business.
196	Because they were getting it from abroad.
199	And in fact, if you see oil-rich countries,
203	where citizens are not yet empowered, the same thing goes --
206	Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, all sorts of countries.
209	Because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way.
214	It empowers authorities, without activating the citizens --
218	their hands, legs, brains, what have you.
222	And if you agree with that, then I think the best way to improve these countries
228	is to recognize that economic development is of the people,
231	by the people, for the people.
234	And that is the real network effect.
236	If citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive,
240	so that their voices are heard,
242	so then things would improve.
244	And to contrast that, you can see the most important institution in the world,
249	the World Bank, is an organization of the government,
253	by the government, for the governments.
256	Just see the contrast.
258	And that is the perspective I have, and then I can start my story.
263	Of course, how would you empower citizens?
266	There could be all sorts of technologies. And one is cell phones.
268	"Recently ""The Economist"" recognized this,"
271	but I stumbled upon the idea 12 years ago,
276	and that's what I've been working on.
282	So 12 years ago, I was trying to be an investment banker in New York.
285	We had -- quite a few our colleagues were connected by a computer network.
293	And we got more productive because we didn't have to exchange floppy disks;
300	we could update each other more often.
304	But one time it broke down.
306	And it reminded me of a day in 1971.
310	There was a war going on in my country.
314	And my family moved out of an urban place, where we used to live,
317	to a remote rural area where it was safer.
321	And one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling.
324	And I walked 10 miles or so, all morning, to get there, to the medicine man.
331	And he wasn't there, so I walked all afternoon back.
334	So I had another unproductive day.
336	So while I was sitting in a tall building in New York,
339	I put those two experiences together side by side,
342	and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity --
345	whether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village.
350	So naturally, I -- the implication of that is
353	that the telephone is a weapon against poverty.
358	And if that's the case, then the question is
360	how many telephones did we have at that time?
364	And it turns out, that there was one telephone in Bangladesh
369	for every 500 people.
371	And all those phones were in the few urban places.
375	The vast rural areas, where 100 million people lived,
378	there were no telephones.
381	So just imagine how many man-months or man-years are wasted,
384	just like I wasted a day.
387	If you just multiply by 100 million people, let's say losing one day a month,
391	whatever, and you see a vast amount of resource wasted.
395	And after all, poor countries, like rich countries, one thing we've got equal,
398	is their days are the same length: 24 hours.
401	So if you lose that precious resource,
404	where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries,
407	that's a huge waste.
410	So I started looking for any evidence that --
414	does connectivity really increase productivity?
418	And I couldn't find much, really, but I found this graph produced by the ITU,
422	which is the International Telecommunication Union, based in Geneva.
428	They show an interesting thing.
431	That you see, the horizontal axis is where you place your country.
435	So the United States or the UK would be here, outside.
438	And so the impact of one new telephone,
442	which is on the vertical axis, is very little.
447	But if you come back to a poorer country, where the GNP per capita is,
450	let's say, 500 dollars, or 300 dollars,
453	then the impact is huge: 6,000 dollars. Or 5,000 dollars.
460	The question was,
461	how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh?
465	It turns out: 2,000 dollars.
469	So if you spend 2,000 dollars, and let's say the telephone lasts 10 years,
472	and if 5,000 dollars every year -- so that's 50,000 dollars.
475	So obviously this was a gadget to have.
479	And of course, if the cost of installing a telephone is going down,
484	because there's a digital revolution going on,
486	then it would be even more dramatic.
490	And I knew a little economics by then --
493	it says Adam Smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity.
496	But how would you specialize?
499	Let's say I'm a fisherman and a farmer.
503	And Chris is a fisherman farmer. Both are generalists.
509	So the point is that we could only -- the only way we could depend on each other,
513	is if we can connect with each other.
516	And if we are neighbors, I could just walk over to his house.
521	But then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area.
525	But in order to expand that, you need a river,
528	or you need a highway, or you need telephone lines.
530	But in any event, it's connectivity that leads to dependability.
535	And that leads to specialization.
537	That leads to productivity.
539	So the question was, I started looking at this issue,
543	and going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York.
545	There were a lot of reasons people told me
549	why we don't have enough telephones.
552	And one of them is the lacking buying power.
554	Poor people apparently don't have the power to buy.
557	But the point is, if it's a production tool, why do we have to worry about that?
560	I mean, in America, people buy cars,
563	and they put very little money down.
566	They get a car, and they go to work.
569	The work pays them a salary;
572	the salary allows them to pay for the car over time.
575	The car pays for itself.
576	So if the telephone is a production tool,
579	then we don't quite have to worry about the purchasing power.
582	And of course, even if that's true, then what about initial buying power?
587	So then the question is, why can't we have some kind of shared access?
592	In the United States, we have -- everybody needs a banking service,
596	but very few of us are trying to buy a bank.
599	So it's -- a bank tends to serve a whole community.
603	So we could do that for telephones.
606	And also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet:
611	food, clothing, shelter, whatever.
614	But again, it's very paternalistic.
616	You should be raising income
619	and let people decide what they want to do with their money.
624	But the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures.
627	See, you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing.
632	For instance, the Internet was booming in the U.S.
635	because there were -- there were people who had computers.
638	They had modems.
640	They had telephone lines, so it's very easy to bring in a new idea, like the Internet.
644	But that's what's lacking in a poor country.
647	So for example, we didn't have ways to have credit checks,
649	few banks to collect bills, etc.
654	But that's why I noticed Grameen Bank, which is a bank for poor people,
657	and had 1,100 branches, 12,000 employees, 2.3 million borrowers.
664	And they had these branches.
666	I thought I could put cell towers and create a network.
671	And anyway, to cut the time short -- so I started --
675	I first went to them and said,
678	"""You know, perhaps I could connect all your branches and make you more efficient."""
681	But you know, they have, after all, evolved in a country without telephones,
685	so they are decentralized. I mean, of course there might be other good reasons,
690	but this was one of the reasons -- they had to be.
692	And so they were not that interested to connect all their branches,
696	and then to be -- and rock the boat.
698	So I started focusing. What is it that they really do?
702	So what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank.
705	She typically buys a cow. The cow gives milk.
709	And she sells the milk to the villagers, and pays off the loan.
713	And this is a business for her, but it's milk for everybody else.
718	And suddenly I realized that a cell phone could be a cow.
720	Because some way she could borrow 200 dollars from the bank,
724	get a phone and have the phone for everybody.
727	And it's a business for her.
730	So I wrote to the bank, and they thought for a while, and they said,
734	"""It's a little crazy, but logical."
736	"If you think it can be done, come and make it happen."""
740	So I quit my job; I went back to Bangladesh.
743	I created a company in America called Gonofone,
746	"which in Bengali means ""people's phone."""
749	And angel investors in America put in money into that.
751	I flew around the world.
753	After about a million -- I mean, I got rejected from lots of places,
756	because I was not only trying to go to a poor country,
759	I was trying to go to the poor of the poor country.
761	After about a million miles, and a meaningful --
765	a substantial loss of hair, I eventually put together a consortium, and --
768	which involved the Norwegian telephone company,
772	which provided the know-how,
775	and the Grameen Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service.
781	To make the story short, here is the coverage of the country.
785	You can see it's pretty much covered.
788	Even in Bangladesh, there are some empty places.
791	But we are also investing around another 300 million dollars this year
795	to extend that coverage.
800	Now, about that cow model I talked about.
803	There are about 115,000 people who are retailing telephone services
809	in their neighborhoods.
811	And it's serving 52,000 villages, which represent about 80 million people.
817	And these phones are generating
821	about 100 million dollars for the company.
824	And two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day, which is like 700 dollars per year.
833	And of course, it's very beneficial in a lot of ways.
835	It increases income, improves welfare, etc.
838	And the result is, right now, this company is the largest telephone company,
842	with 3.5 million subscribers,
847	that produces about a third of the traffic in the network.
852	And 2004, the net profit, after taxes --
856	very serious taxes -- was 120 million dollars.
860	And the company contributed about 190 million dollars to the government coffers.
866	And again, here are some of the lessons.
868	"""The government needs to provide economically viable services."""
870	Actually, this is an instance where private companies can provide that.
873	"""Governments need to subsidize private companies."""
876	This is what some people think.
878	And actually, private companies help governments with taxes.
881	"""Poor people are recipients."""
883	Poor people are a resource.
886	"""Services cost too much for the poor."""
888	Their involvement reduces the cost.
892	"""The poor are uneducated and cannot do much."""
895	They are very eager learners and very capable survivors.
898	I've been very surprised.
900	Most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day.
903	"""Poor countries need aid."""
906	Businesses -- this one company has raised the --
909	if the ideal figures are even five percent true, this one company
914	is raising the GNP of the country much more than the aid the country receives.
919	And as I was trying to show you, as far as I'm concerned,
922	aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens.
927	And this is a new project I have with Dean Kamen, the famous inventor in America.
931	He has produced some power generators,
934	which we are now doing an experiment in Bangladesh,
938	in two villages where cow manure is producing biogas,
941	which is running these generators.
945	And each of these generators is selling electricity to 20 houses each.
948	It's just an experiment.
952	We don't know how far it will go,
953	but it's going on.
955	Thank you.
