12.88	"""Pheromone"" is a very powerful word."
16.318	It conjures up sex, abandon, loss of control,
20.462	and you can see, it's very important as a word.
24.154	But it's only 50 years old. It was invented in 1959.
29.437	Now, if you put that word into the web,
31.986	as you may have done,
33.496	you'll come up with millions of hits,
35.888	and almost all of those sites are trying to sell you
38.533	something to make you irresistible
40.792	for 10 dollars or more.
43.865	Now, this is a very attractive idea,
46.088	and the molecules they mention
48.53	sound really science-y.
50.444	They've got lots of syllables.
52.028	It's things like androstenol, androstenone
54.901	or androstadienone.
57.342	It gets better and better,
58.984	and when you combine that with white lab coats,
61.774	you must imagine that there is
63.186	fantastic science behind this.
65.7	But sadly, these are fraudulent claims
70.822	supported by dodgy science.
74.161	The problem is that, although there are many
76.779	good scientists working on what they think
79.324	are human pheromones,
81.194	and they're publishing in respectable journals,
83.799	at the basis of this,
85.38	despite very sophisticated experiments,
88.716	there really is no good science behind it,
91.269	because it's based on a problem,
94.561	which is nobody has systematically gone through
98.011	all the odors that humans produce --
100.112	and there are thousands of
100.112	molecules that we give off.
102.89	We're mammals. We produce a lot of smell.
106	Nobody has gone through systematically
108.144	to work out which molecules really are pheromones.
110.911	They've just plucked a few,
112.541	and all these experiments are based on those,
114.43	but there's no good evidence at all.
117.44	Now, that's not to say
119.618	that smell is not important to people.
121.78	It is, and some people are real enthusiasts,
125.282	and one of these was Napoleon.
128.779	And famously, you may remember
130.571	that out on the campaign trail for war,
133.668	he wrote to his lover, Empress Josephine,
136.475	"saying, ""Don't wash. I'm coming home."""
139.709	(Laughter)
140.311	So he didn't want to lose any of her richness
143.232	in the days before he'd get home,
145.581	and it is still, you'll find websites
147.958	that offer this as a major quirk.
151.86	At the same time, though,
153.024	we spend about as much money
155.477	taking the smells off us
157.248	as putting them back on in perfumes,
159.969	and perfumes are a multi-billion-dollar business.
164.16	So what I want to do in the rest of this talk
166.563	is tell you about what pheromones really are,
171.841	tell you why I think we would expect
174.839	humans to have pheromones,
177.587	tell you about some of the
177.587	confusions in pheromones,
182.08	and then finally, I want to end with
184.872	a promising avenue which shows us
186.842	the way we ought to be going.
190.99	So the ancient Greeks knew
195.171	that dogs sent invisible signals between each other.
199.225	A female dog in heat
201.599	sent an invisible signal to male dogs
203.515	for miles around,
204.97	and it wasn't a sound, it was a smell.
207.075	You could take the smell from the female dog,
209.256	and the dogs would chase the cloth.
211.719	But the problem for everybody
213.327	who could see this effect
215.44	was that you couldn't identify the molecules.
217.062	You couldn't demonstrate it was chemical.
219.515	The reason for that, of course,
220.83	is that each of these animals
222.245	produces tiny quantities,
223.851	and in the case of the dog,
225.51	males dogs can smell it, but we can't smell it.
228.412	And it was only in 1959 that a German team,
232.77	after spending 20 years in
232.77	search of these molecules,
236.122	discovered, identified, the first pheromone,
239.903	and this was the sex pheromone of a silk moth.
243.181	Now, this was an inspired choice 
243.181	by Adolf Butenandt and his team,
246.855	because he needed half a million moths
248.981	to get enough material to do the chemical analysis.
252.008	But he created the model
254.097	for how you should go about pheromone analysis.
256.461	He basically went through systematically,
259.142	showing that only the molecule in question
262.087	was the one that stimulated the males,
263.953	not all the others.
266.006	He analyzed it very carefully.
268.164	He synthesized the molecule,
269.981	and then tried the synthesized
269.981	molecule on the males
273.289	and got them to respond and showed it was,
276.15	indeed, that molecule.
277.91	That's closing the circle.
280.06	That's the thing which has
280.06	never been done with humans:
282.765	nothing systematic, no real demonstration.
286.375	With that new concept,
288.109	we needed a new word,
289.818	"and that was the word ""pheromone,"""
292.653	and it's basically transferred excitement,
296.254	transferred between individuals,
298.523	and since 1959, pheromones have been found
301.349	right the way across the animal kingdom,
303.224	in male animals, in female animals.
305.426	It works just as well underwater
306.971	for goldfish and lobsters.
308.993	And almost every mammal you can think of
310.74	has had a pheromone identified,
312.563	and of course, an enormous number of insects.
316.393	So we know that pheromones exist
318.362	right the way across the animal kingdom.
321.423	What about humans?
323.196	Well, the first thing, of course,
324.444	is that we're mammals,
326.101	and mammals are smelly.
327.66	As any dog owner can tell you,
329.536	we smell, they smell.
331.517	But the real reason we might think
333.498	that humans have pheromones
335.323	is the change that occurs as we grow up.
338.541	The smell of a room of teenagers
340.992	is quite different
342.481	from the smell of a room of small children.
345.301	What's changed? And of course, it's puberty.
348.173	Along with the pubic hair
349.632	and the hair in the armpits,
351.325	new glands start to secrete in those places,
355.067	and that's what's making the change in smell.
357.682	If we were any other kind of mammal,
359.83	or any other kind of animal,
361.019	we would say,
362.156	"""That must be something to do with pheromones,"""
364.028	and we'd start looking properly.
366.684	But there are some problems, and this is why,
368.66	I think, people have not looked for
371.729	pheromones so effectively in humans.
374.646	There are, indeed, problems.
376.217	And the first of these
378.401	is perhaps surprising.
379.918	It's all about culture.
381.752	Now moths don't learn a lot
383.899	about what is good to smell, but humans do,
387.516	and up to the age of about four,
389.362	any smell, no matter how rancid,
392.081	is simply interesting.
393.88	And I understand that the major role of parents
395.932	is to stop kids putting their fingers in poo,
399.613	because it's always something nice to smell.
402.411	But gradually we learn what's not good,
405.102	and one of the things we learn
406.592	at the same time as what is not good
408.727	is what is good.
410.485	Now, the cheese behind me
412.747	is a British, if not an English, delicacy.
416.698	It's ripe blue Stilton.
420.135	Liking it is incomprehensible to
420.135	people from other countries.
424.497	Every culture has its own special food
427.782	and national delicacy.
429.878	If you were to come from Iceland,
431.93	your national dish
433.254	is deep rotted shark.
436.23	Now, all of these things are acquired tastes,
438.36	but they form almost a badge of identity.
441.52	You're part of the in-group.
446.34	The second thing is the sense of smell.
449.922	Each of us has a unique odor world,
453.391	in the sense that what we smell,
455.93	we each smell a completely different world.
458.789	Now, smell was the hardest
460.498	of the senses to crack,
462.359	and the Nobel Prize awarded to
464.074	Richard Axel and Linda Buck
465.707	was only awarded in 2004
468.14	for their discovery of how smell works.
470.93	It's really hard,
472.307	but in essence, nerves from the brain
474.898	go up into the nose
477.111	and on these nerves exposed in the nose
479.492	to the outside air are receptors,
482.546	and odor molecules coming in on a sniff
485.695	interact with these receptors,
487.845	and if they bond, they send the nerve a signal
492.104	which goes back into the brain.
494.412	We don't just have one kind of receptor.
496.474	If you're a human, you have about 400
498.35	different kinds of receptors,
500.415	and the brain knows what you're smelling
503.382	because of the combination of receptors
505.193	and nerve cells that they trigger,
507.706	sending messages up to the brain
509.264	in a combinatorial fashion.
512.17	But it's a bit more complicated,
513.16	because each of those 400
515.295	comes in various variants,
517.446	and depending which variant you have,
519.517	you might smell coriander, or cilantro, that herb,
523.699	either as something delicious and savory
526.317	or something like soap.
528.491	So we each have an individual world of smell,
531.177	and that complicates anything
532.818	when we're studying smell.
535.114	Well, we really ought to talk about armpits,
537.806	and I have to say that I do
537.806	have particularly good ones.
541.202	Now, I'm not going to share them with you,
543.204	but this is the place that most people
545.183	have looked for pheromones.
546.92	There is one good reason,
548.423	which is, the great apes have armpits
551.827	as their unique characteristic.
554.155	The other primates have scent glands
556.556	in other parts of the body.
558.386	The great apes have these armpits
560.74	full of secretory glands
562.957	producing smells all the time,
565.298	enormous numbers of molecules.
568.998	When they're secreted from the glands,
570.701	the molecules are odorless.
572.705	They have no smell at all,
574.78	and it's only the wonderful bacteria
576.749	growing on the rainforest of hair
578.962	that actually produces the smells
580.418	that we know and love.
582.439	And so incidentally, if you want to reduce
584.339	the amount of smell,
585.769	clear-cutting your armpits
587.689	is a very effective way of reducing
589.945	the habitat for bacteria,
591.459	and you'll find they remain less smelly
593.796	for much longer.
595.89	But although we've focused on armpits,
598.436	I think it's partly because they're the least
599.803	embarrassing place to go and ask people for samples.
603.77	There is actually another reason why we might not
606.382	be looking for a universal sex pheromone there,
609.158	and that's because 20 percent
609.158	of the world's population
612.997	doesn't have smelly armpits like me.
616.442	And these are people from China, Japan,
620.358	Korea, and other parts of northeast Asia.
622.953	They simply don't secrete those odorless precursors
626.477	that the bacteria love to use to produce the smells
630.73	that in an ethnocentric way we always thought of
633.079	as characteristic of armpits.
635.184	So it doesn't apply to 20 percent of the world.
639.691	So what should we be doing
642.693	in our search for human pheromones?
645.746	I'm fairly convinced that we do have them.
648.198	We're mammals, like everybody else
650.151	who's a mammal, and we probably do have them.
654.13	But what I think we should do
655.713	is go right back to the beginning,
657.652	and basically look all over the body.
659.991	No matter how embarrassing,
661.682	we need to search and go for the first time
665.06	where no one else has dared tread.
667.52	It's going to be difficult,
668.668	it's going to be embarrassing, but we need to look.
671.243	We also need to go back to the ideas
674.19	that Butenandt used when he
674.19	was studying the silk moth.
677.457	We need to go back and look systematically
680.925	at all the molecules that are being produced,
683.063	and work out which ones are really involved.
685.496	It isn't good enough simply to pluck a couple
687.602	"and say, ""They'll do."""
689.546	We have to actually demonstrate
690.945	that they really have the effects we claim.
693.755	There is one team that I'm
693.755	actually very impressed by.
696.989	They're in France, and their previous success
700.165	was identifying the rabbit mammary pheromone.
704.542	They've turned their attention now
707.111	to human babies and mothers.
710.296	So this is a baby having a drink of milk
713.367	from its mother's breast.
716.01	Her nipple is completely hidden
718.193	by the baby's head,
719.439	but what you'll notice is a white droplet
723.19	with an arrow pointing to it,
724.971	and that's the secretion from the areolar glands.
728.17	Now, we all have them, men and women,
731.16	and these are the little bumps around the nipple,
733.978	and if you're a lactating woman,
735.937	these start to secrete.
738.274	It's a very interesting secretion.
740.863	What Benoist Schaal and his team developed
743.866	was a simple test to investigate
746.273	what the effect of this secretion might be,
749.079	in effect, a simple bioassay.
752.055	So this is a sleeping baby,
754.73	and under its nose, we've put a clean glass rod.
759.719	The baby remains sleeping,
761.83	showing no interest at all.
764.171	But if we go to any mother
766.245	who is secreting from the areolar glands,
768.674	so it's not about recognition,
770.251	it can be from any mother,
772.479	if we take the secretion
773.831	and now put it under the baby's nose,
776.735	we get a very different reaction.
778.826	It's a connoisseur's reaction of delight,
781.81	and it opens its mouth
783.87	and sticks out its tongue
785.523	and starts to suck.
787.61	Now, since this is from any mother,
789.95	it could really be a pheromone.
791.742	It's not about individual recognition.
793.521	Any mother will do.
795.397	Now, why is this important,
796.86	apart from being simply very interesting?
799.318	It's because women vary
801.125	in the number of areolar glands that they have,
803.898	and there is a correlation between the ease
806.094	with which babies start to suckle
808.636	and the number of areolar glands she has.
810.498	It appears that the more secretions she's got,
813.296	the more likely the baby is to suckle quickly.
816.958	If you're a mammal,
818.418	the most dangerous time in life
820.961	is the first few hours after birth.
823.27	You have to get that first drink of milk,
827.03	and if you don't get it, you won't survive.
830.521	You'll be dead.
831.985	Since many babies actually find it difficult
834.623	to take that first meal,
836.272	because they're not getting the right stimulus,
838.249	if we could identify what that molecule was,
841.459	and the French team are being very cautious,
843.446	but if we could identify the molecule,
845.561	synthesize it, it would then mean
848.355	premature babies would be more likely to suckle,
850.261	and every baby would have a better chance
853.189	of survival.
854.51	So what I want to argue is this is one example
857.05	of where a systematic, really scientific approach
860.646	can actually bring you a real understanding
863.368	of pheromones.
864.476	There could be all sorts of medical interventions.
867.09	There could be all sorts of things
868.344	that humans are doing with pheromones
870.044	that we simply don't know at the moment.
872.092	What we need to remember is pheromones
873.978	are not just about sex.
875.356	They're about all sorts of things to do
877.072	with a mammal's life.
878.795	So do go forward and do search for more.
881.484	There's lots to find.
882.524	Thank you very much.
884.39	(Applause)
