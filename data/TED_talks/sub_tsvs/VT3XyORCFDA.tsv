13.243	I want to share some personal friends and stories with you
17.195	that I've actually never talked about in public before
19.232	to help illustrate the idea
21.592	and the need and the hope
23.511	for us to reinvent our health care system around the world.
26.793	Twenty-four years ago, I had -- a sophomore in college,
30.18	I had a series of fainting spells. No alcohol was involved.
33.002	And I ended up in student health,
35.933	and they ran some labwork and came back right away,
38.102	"and said, ""Kidney problems."""
40.275	And before I knew it, I was involved and thrown into
43.725	this six months of tests and trials and tribulations
46.945	with six doctors across two hospitals
49.629	in this clash of medical titans
52.325	to figure out which one of them was right
54.369	about what was wrong with me.
56.833	And I'm sitting in a waiting room some time later for an ultrasound,
60.106	and all six of these doctors actually show up in the room at once,
62.929	"and I'm like, ""Uh oh, this is bad news."""
67.281	And their diagnosis was this:
68.844	"They said, ""You have two rare kidney diseases"
70.754	that are going to actually destroy your kidneys eventually,
73.435	you have cancer-like cells in your immune system
75.972	that we need to start treatment right away,
77.889	and you'll never be eligible for a kidney transplant,
80.346	"and you're not likely to live more than two or three years."""
83.765	Now, with the gravity of this doomsday diagnosis,
86.729	it just sucked me in immediately,
89.129	as if I began preparing myself as a patient
91.771	to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me,
95.868	until I met a patient named Verna in a waiting room,
98.508	who became a dear friend, and she grabbed me one day
100.566	and took me off to the medical library
102.56	and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases,
105.494	"and said, ""Eric, these people who get this"
108.014	are normally in their '70s and '80s.
109.962	They don't know anything about you. Wake up.
113.073	"Take control of your health and get on with your life."""
116.195	And I did.
117.737	Now, these people making these proclamations to me
120.097	were not bad people.
121.423	In fact, these professionals were miracle workers,
123.984	but they're working in a flawed, expensive system that's set up the wrong way.
128.05	It's dependent on hospitals and clinics for our every care need.
131.305	It's dependent on specialists who just look at parts of us.
134.972	It's dependent on guesswork of diagnoses and drug cocktails,
138.887	and so something either works or you die.
141.487	And it's dependent on passive patients
145.695	who just take it and don't ask any questions.
149.457	Now the problem with this model
151.019	is that it's unsustainable globally.
153.505	It's unaffordable globally.
155.459	We need to invent what I call a personal health system.
158.946	So what does this personal health system look like,
161.269	and what new technologies and roles is it going to entail?
166.31	Now, I'm going to start by actually sharing with you
168.463	a new friend of mine, Libby,
170.359	somebody I've become quite attached to over the last six months.
173.073	This is Libby, or actually, this is an ultrasound image of Libby.
176.949	This is the kidney transplant I was never supposed to have.
179.82	Now, this is an image that we shot a couple of weeks ago for today,
183.671	and you'll notice, on the edge of this image,
185.611	there's some dark spots there, which was really concerning to me.
188.52	So we're going to actually do a live exam
191.049	to sort of see how Libby's doing.
192.424	This is not a wardrobe malfunction. I have to take my belt off here.
195.142	Don't you in the front row worry or anything.
197.276	(Laughter)
198.558	I'm going to use a device from a company called Mobisante.
202.285	This is a portable ultrasound.
203.759	It can plug into a smartphone. It can plug into a tablet.
206.302	Mobisante is up in Redmond, Washington,
208.432	and they kindly trained me to actually do this on myself.
212.082	They're not approved to do this. Patients are not approved to do this.
214.287	This is a concept demo, so I want to make that clear.
217.098	All right, I gotta gel up.
218.185	Now the people in the front row are very nervous. (Laughter)
222.636	And I want to actually introduce you to Dr. Batiuk,
226.681	who's another friend of mine.
228.128	He's up in Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, Oregon.
232.014	So let me just make sure. Hey, Dr. Batiuk. Can you hear me okay?
235.508	And actually, can you see Libby?
237.684	Thomas Batuik: Hi there, Eric.
238.862	You look busy. How are you?
240.107	Eric Dishman: I'm good. I'm just taking my clothes off
242.835	in front of a few hundred people. It's wonderful.
245.404	So I just wanted to see, is this the image you need to get?
250.061	And I know you want to look and see if those spots are still there.
253.798	TB: Okay. Well let's scan around a little bit here,
256.527	give me a lay of the land.
257.802	ED: All right.TB: Okay. Turn it a little bit inside,
261.318	a little bit toward the middle for me.
263.718	Okay, that's good. How about up a little bit?
268.514	Okay, freeze that image. That's a good one for me.
271.564	ED: All right. Now last week, when I did this,
274.251	you had me measure that spot to the right.
277.052	Should I do that again?
278.739	TB: Yeah, let's do that.
279.783	ED: All right. This is kind of hard to do
283.087	with one hand on your belly and one hand on measuring,
285.258	but I've got it, I think,
286.513	and I'll save that image and send it to you.
289.064	So tell me a little bit about what this dark spot means.
291.536	It's not something I was very happy about.
293.641	TB: Many people after a kidney transplant
295.584	will develop a little fluid collection around the kidney.
298.852	Most of the time it doesn't create any kind of mischief,
302.133	but it does warrant looking at,
304.541	so I'm happy we've got an opportunity to look at it today,
307.516	make sure that it's not growing, it's not creating any problems.
310.444	Based on the other images we have,
312.66	I'm really happy how it looks today.
315.044	ED: All right. Well, I guess we'll double check it when I come in.
317.441	I've got my six month biopsy in a couple of weeks,
320.006	and I'm going to let you do that in the clinic,
321.715	because I don't think I can do that one on myself.
324.155	TB: Good choice.ED: All right, thanks, Dr. Batiuk.
326.8	All right. So what you're sort of seeing here
328.931	is an example of disruptive technologies,
331.039	of mobile, social and analytic technologies.
334.235	These are the foundations of what's going to make personal health possible.
337.146	Now there's really three pillars
339.731	of this personal health I want to talk to you about now,
341.628	and it's care anywhere, care networking and care customization.
345.42	And you just saw a little bit of the first two
347.103	with my interaction with Dr. Batiuk.
348.644	So let's start with care anywhere.
351.524	Humans invented the idea of hospitals and clinics
354.252	in the 1780s. It is time to update our thinking.
358.152	We have got to untether clinicians and patients
361.646	from the notion of traveling to a special
364.264	bricks-and-mortar place for all of our care,
366.844	because these places are often the wrong tool,
369.145	and the most expensive tool, for the job.
371.611	And these are sometimes unsafe places to send our sickest patients,
375.163	especially in an era of superbugs
377.3	and hospital-acquired infections.
379.416	And many countries are going to go brickless from the start
382.298	because they're never going to be able to afford
384.264	the mega-medicalplexes that a lot of the rest of the world has built.
388.784	Now I personally learned that hospitals
391.54	can be a very dangerous place at a young age.
394.056	This was me in third grade.
395.896	I broke my elbow very seriously, had to have surgery,
398.312	worried that they were going to actually lose the arm.
400.639	Recovering from the surgery in the hospital, I get bedsores.
403.575	Those bedsores become infected,
405.808	and they give me an antibiotic which I end up being allergic to,
408.744	and now my whole body breaks out,
410.695	and now all of those become infected.
413.255	The longer I stayed in the hospital, the sicker I became,
415.802	and the more expensive it became,
417.387	and this happens to millions of people around the world every year.
420.732	The future of personal health that I'm talking about
423.075	says care must occur at home as the default model,
427.533	not in a hospital or clinic.
429.013	You have to earn your way into those places
430.573	by being sick enough to use that tool for the job.
434.139	Now the smartphones that we're already carrying
436.245	can clearly have diagnostic devices like ultrasounds plugged into them,
439.971	and a whole array of others, today,
442.142	and as sensing is built into these,
443.664	we'll be able to do vital signs monitor
445.694	and behavioral monitoring like we've never had before.
448.533	Many of us will have implantables that will actually look
451.085	real-time at what's going on with our blood chemistry
453.822	and in our proteins right now.
456.069	Now the software is also getting smarter, right?
458.764	Think about a coach, an agent online,
461.861	that's going to help me do safe self-care.
463.997	That same interaction that we just did with the ultrasound
466.302	will likely have real-time image processing,
468.525	"and the device will say, ""Up, down, left, right,"
470.67	ah, Eric, that's the perfect spot to send that image
473.326	"off to your doctor."""
475.175	Now, if we've got all these networked devices
477.382	that are helping us to do care anywhere,
479.762	it stands to reason that we also need a team
481.557	to be able to interact with all of that stuff,
483.544	and that leads to the second pillar I want to talk about,
486.165	care networking.
487.737	We have got to go beyond this paradigm
490.883	of isolated specialists doing parts care
494.534	to multidisciplinary teams doing person care.
498.753	Uncoordinated care today is expensive at best,
502.149	and it is deadly at worst.
504.244	Eighty percent of medical errors are actually caused
506.647	by communication and coordination problems
508.595	amongst medical team members.
510.916	I had my own heart scare years ago in graduate school,
513.155	when we're under treatment for the kidney,
515.269	"and suddenly, they're like, ""Oh, we think you have a heart problem."""
517.883	And I have these palpitations that are showing up.
519.768	They put me through five weeks of tests --
522.274	very expensive, very scary -- before the nurse finally notices
525.773	the piece of the paper, my meds list
527.869	that I've been carrying to every single appointment,
529.391	"and says, ""Oh my gosh."""
531.577	Three different specialists had prescribed
533.546	three different versions of the same drug to me.
535.585	I did not have a heart problem. I had an overdose problem.
539.86	I had a care coordination problem.
542.673	And this happens to millions of people every year.
545.439	I want to use technology that we're all working on and making happen
549.073	to make health care a coordinated team sport.
552.805	Now this is the most frightening thing to me.
555.107	Out of all the care I've had in hospitals and clinics around the world,
559.365	the first time I've ever had a true team-based care experience
562.712	was at Legacy Good Sam these last six months
565.483	for me to go get this.
566.541	And this is a picture of my graduation team from Legacy.
569.51	There's a couple of the folks here. You'll recognize Dr. Batiuk.
572.02	We just talked to him. Here's Jenny, one of the nurses,
574.636	Allison, who helped manage the transplant list,
576.948	and a dozen other people who aren't pictured,
579.092	a pharmacist, a psychologist, a nutritionist,
581.628	even a financial counselor, Lisa,
583.87	who helped us deal with all the insurance hassles.
586.597	I wept the day I graduated.
589.196	I should have been happy, because I was so well
590.823	that I could go back to my normal doctors,
592.476	but I wept because I was so actually connected to this team.
595.771	And here's the most important part.
597.367	The other people in this picture are me and my wife, Ashley.
600.406	Legacy trained us on how to do care for me at home
604.508	so that they could offload the hospitals and clinics.
607.252	That's the only way that the model works.
609.716	My team is actually working in China
611.532	on one of these self-care models
613.271	for a project we called Age-Friendly Cities.
615.644	We're trying to help build a social network
617.438	that can help track and train the care of seniors
619.922	caring for themselves
621.429	as well as the care provided by their family members
623.834	or volunteer community health workers,
626.316	as well as have an exchange network online,
628.572	where, for example, I can donate three hours of care a day to your mom,
631.9	if somebody else can help me with transportation to meals,
634.77	and we exchange all of that online.
637.428	The most important point I want to make to you about this
639.818	is the sacred and somewhat over-romanticized
643.132	doctor-patient one-on-one
645.906	is a relic of the past.
648.022	The future of health care is smart teams,
650.474	and you'd better be on that team for yourself.
654.043	Now, the last thing that I want to talk to you about
656.335	is care customization,
657.575	because if you've got care anywhere and you've got care networking,
660.5	those are going to go a long way towards improving our health care system,
663.308	but there's still too much guesswork.
666.341	Randomized clinical trials were actually invented in 1948
670.429	to help invent the drugs that cured tuberculosis,
673.811	and those are important things, don't get me wrong.
676.108	These population studies that we've done have created
677.973	tons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives,
680.552	but the problem is that health care
682.987	is treating us as averages, not unique individuals,
687.067	because at the end of the day,
688.614	the patient is not the same thing as the population
691.869	who are studied. That's what's leading to the guesswork.
695.147	The technologies that are coming,
696.985	high-performance computing, analytics,
699.074	big data that everyone's talking about,
700.991	will allow us to build predictive models for each of us
703.91	as individual patients.
705.864	And the magic here is, experiment on my avatar
710.323	in software, not my body in suffering.
715.124	Now, I've had two examples I want to quickly share with you
717.607	of this kind of care customization on my own journey.
720.166	The first was quite simple. I finally realized some years ago
723.343	that all my medical teams were optimizing my treatment for longevity.
727.22	It's like a badge of honor to see how long they can get the patient to live.
729.974	I was optimizing my life for quality of life,
733.041	and quality of life for me means time in snow.
737.421	"So on my chart, I forced them to put, ""Patient goal:"
740.251	low doses of drugs over longer periods of time,
744.017	"side effects friendly to skiing."""
747.263	And I think that's why I achieved longevity.
749.915	I think that time-in-snow therapy was as important
752.147	as the pharmaceuticals that I had.
754.28	Now the second example of customization -- and by the way,
756.595	you can't customize care if you don't know your own goals,
758.491	so health care can't know those until you know your own health care goals.
761.86	But the second example I want to give you is,
763.572	I happened to be an early guinea pig,
765.359	and I got very lucky to have my whole genome sequenced.
768.963	Now it took about two weeks of processing
771.285	on Intel's highest-end servers to make this happen,
773.409	and another six months of human and computing labor
776.441	to make sense of all of that data.
779.003	"And at the end of all of that, they said, ""Yes,"
782.053	those diagnoses of that clash of medical titans
784.491	all of those years ago were wrong,
786.875	"and we have a better path forward."""
789.149	The future that Intel's working on now is to figure out
791.534	how to make that computing for personalized medicine
793.731	go from months and weeks to even hours,
797.484	and make this kind of tool available,
799.155	not just in the mainframes of tier-one research hospitals around the world,
802.973	but in the mainstream -- every patient, every clinic
805.779	with access to whole genome sequencing.
807.928	And I tell you, this kind of care customization
810.271	for everything from your goals to your genetics
813.097	will be the most game-changing transformation
814.862	that we witness in health care during our lifetime.
818.444	So these three pillars of personal health,
821.378	care anywhere, care networking, care customization,
824.236	are happening in pieces now,
825.483	but this vision will completely fail if we don't step up
829.266	as caregivers and as patients to take on new roles.
833.267	It's what my friend Verna said:
834.92	Wake up and take control of your health.
837.041	Because at the end of the day these technologies
838.63	are simply about people caring for other people
842.527	and ourselves in some powerful new ways.
845.938	And it's in that spirit that I want to introduce you
847.498	to one last friend, very quickly.
850.049	Tracey Gamley stepped up to give me the impossible kidney
853.916	that I was never supposed to have.
858.597	(Applause)
874.992	So Tracey, just tell us a little bit quickly about what the donor experience was like with you.
879.349	Tracey Gamley: For me, it was really easy.
881.233	I only had one night in the hospital.
883.184	The surgery was done laparoscopically,
884.888	so I have just five very small scars on my abdomen,
888.094	and I had four weeks away from work
890.133	and went back to doing everything I'd done before
892.016	without any changes.
893.532	ED: Well, I probably will never get a chance to say this to you
896.518	in such a large audience ever again.
898.977	"So ""thank you"" feel likes a really trite word,"
901.764	but thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life.
904.226	(Applause)
910.109	This TED stage and all of the TED stages
912.558	are often about celebrating innovation
915.284	and celebrating new technologies,
916.393	and I've done that here today,
918.678	and I've seen amazing things coming from TED speakers,
921.007	I mean, my gosh, artificial kidneys, even printable kidneys, that are coming.
925.04	But until such time that these amazing technologies
928.221	are available to all of us, and even when they are,
931.259	it's up to us to care for, and even save, one another.
935.686	I hope you will go out and make personal health happen
938.124	for yourselves and for everyone. Thanks so much.
942.052	(Applause)
