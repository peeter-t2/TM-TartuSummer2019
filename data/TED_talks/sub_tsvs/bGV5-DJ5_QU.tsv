26	Three years ago, I got a phone call, based on an earlier film I had made,
29	with an offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard.
33	My idea -- and literally, I woke up in the middle of the night,
36	and we've all have those moments. You know, you go to sleep --
38	I was excited, with this phone call.
41	I was thinking, I just finished making another film about World War II vets,
44	and I realized I'd gotten to know their stories,
46	and I realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
50	to tell a warrior's story as it unfolded.
52	So I went to bed that night pretty excited.
55	Not sure of all the details, but excited.
60	It wasn't at four in the morning, but it was closer to midnight.
62	Woke straight up. Wide-awake as could be.
64	And I had this idea: what if I could, in effect, virtually embed,
67	and create a permeable relationship with the soldiers?
70	To tell the story from the inside out, versus the outside in?
74	So, I called back Major Heilshorn,
76	who's the public affairs officer of the New Hampshire National Guard.
78	"And he knew me, so I was like, ""Greg?"""
81	"He's like, ""Yes, Deborah?"""
83	Told him my idea, and you know,
86	he is one of the bravest men in the world,
88	as is General Blair, who, in the end, gave me permission to try this experiment.
93	Within 10 days, I was down at Fort Dix.
95	He gave me my pick of units.
97	I picked one unit -- Charlie Company, Third of the 172nd,
100	they're mountain infantry -- for two reasons.
102	One, they're infantry.
104	Number two, they were going to be based at LSA Anaconda,
107	so I knew they would have Internet access.
109	The caveat for my access was I had to get the soldiers to volunteer.
111	This was a big thing that
113	I think when Major H told me,
115	I wasn't really totally gathering what that would mean.
118	So what that meant was, when I went down to Fort Dix,
120	I had to hop out in front of 180 guys and tell them of my vision.
124	You can imagine the hailstorm of questions I got.
126	The opening one was,
128	"""What the fuck do you know about the National Guard?"""
131	I started with the 1607 Massachusetts Bay Colony Pequot Indian Wars.
136	Gave them about a nine minute response,
139	and there we went.
141	So, I'd like to show the clip of the film.
144	It's our trailer, because I know, obviously you guys are busy,
147	many of you may not have had a chance to see it.
149	So, I want to show the trailer,
151	and then I'm going to take apart one scene in detail.
154	If we could roll?
163	(Video) Stephen Pink: This is Sergeant Stephen Pink.
164	Michael Moriarty: Specialist Michael Moriarty.
166	Zack Bazzi: Do I really want to go? Probably not.
170	Soldier: We're not supposed to talk to the media.
172	SP: I'm not the media, dammit!
176	MM: The day is here. Life will change.
178	Voice: The real deal, man! Narrator: You ready?
180	Soldier: Bring it on! Narrator: You ready? Voice 2: Iraq, here we come!
186	ZB: Every soldier eventually wants to go in combat.
188	It's natural instinct.
189	SP: If you let fear get to you,
191	then you're not going to be doing your job.
193	MM: Every single time you go out there, there's attacks.
195	It's unbelievable.
199	ZB: Hey, Nestor, your ass crack is right in my face.
204	Soldiers: IV! Are we on fire? IV!
206	Man down! Man down!
210	MM: Keep going, brother. You wanna play?
213	Michael Moriarty's Wife: It's really hard for him to not have his dad.
216	MM: This little kid is in the middle of a war zone.
222	"Stephen Pink's Girlfriend: In the beginning, he's like, ""Write something dirty!"""
226	George W. Bush: The world's newest democracy.
232	MM: They're shooting at me.
234	SP: You don't put 150,000 troops in there,
236	and say we're there to create democracy.
238	Soldier: We've got a drive through window at Burger King now.
240	SP: We're here to create money.
242	MM: I support George Bush. We're not there for the oil.
245	Jon Baril: The worst thing in my life.
247	SP: Baril, don't look at it, bud.
249	Michael Moriarty's Wife: He's not the same person anymore.
251	MM: I will not go back.
256	Kevin Shangraw: The Iraqi people are who we are there to help --
258	and we just killed one.
259	Soldiers: Sergeant Smith is down! Sergeant Smith is down?
262	There they are! Right there! Fire, fire!
272	JB: It'll be a better country in 20 years, 'cause we were there.
276	I hope.
288	(Applause) Deborah Scranton: Thank you.
289	One of the things I'd like to talk to you about
292	is having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about.
296	And I'd like to relate an experience I had here at TED.
299	I don't know how many of you might imagine it,
302	but there's actually a TEDster who recently got back from Iraq.
307	Paul? Come on, stand up.
309	This is Paul Anthony.
311	He served -- (Applause) -- with the Marines,
316	and I want to tell you a little, brief story.
320	We were one of the lucky ones
322	to get in the class with the Sony cameras and the Vista software.
326	Right? And we started talking.
327	"People will see my tag, and they'll see ""The War Tapes,"""
329	and then we'll start talking about war.
331	We got in a conversation with some other people in the class,
335	and it went on and on.
337	I mean, we were there for an hour, talking.
339	And it really highlighted something that I would like to ask
341	you guys to think about and hopefully to help with,
345	which is, I think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war,
348	and about politics.
349	And really -- because maybe we're going to disagree.
351	Maybe it's going to get uncomfortable.
353	How do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation?
357	And you know, Paul was talking,
362	and he then turned to Constance and said,
365	"""You know, I wouldn't have this conversation if she weren't here,"
368	"because I know she has my back."""
370	And I want to say, I was nervous.
372	Because I'm used to doing Q&amp;As.
374	I really related to what James was saying yesterday,
375	because I'm behind the camera.
377	You know, I can answer questions about my movie,
379	but for me to come up and talk for 18 minutes is a really long time.
381	So, I wanted to say, Paul, I'm happy you're here,
384	because I know you have my back.
387	This film was not about the Internet,
389	but it could not have been made without it.
392	The guys' tapes on average took two weeks to get from Iraq to me.
395	In the meantime, the soldiers -- we would email and IM.
399	I didn't save all of them,
403	because I didn't realize at the beginning
405	that it would be something that I would want to keep track of.
408	But there were 3,211 emails and IMs and text messages
413	that I was able to save.
415	The reason I quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey
422	to really get inside of it.
424	So I wanted to show you a clip,
426	and then I was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together.
429	If we could roll the clip.
431	(Video) SP: Today is sport. [Unclear] Radio: [Unclear] Christian soldiers.
434	SP: We like to give these insurgents a fair chance.
438	So, what we do, we ride with the windows down.
441	Because, you know, we obviously have the advantage. I'm just kidding.
447	We don't fucking ride with the goddam windows down.
450	It's not true. Very unsafe.
456	Whoa.
457	Soldier: Right there.
459	SP: All right, let's get over to that site.
463	Be advised, we're leaving Taji right now.
466	We believe that the blast was right outside the gate of Taji,
470	we're heading to that location now.
474	Soldier: That's a fucking car bomb!
476	Soldier: Motherfuckers!
477	Soldiers: Get your vest on!
479	Hey, get over the fucking -- yeah, yeah.
481	Any one-four elements get to the gate!
483	SP: Sheriff one-six, or any one-four elements,
486	we need you at the gate of Taji right now, over.
489	Soldier: I'll walk you through it.
491	(Voices)
497	SP: Stay low. Head over to the right.
500	Get your bag, get your bag!
504	(Screams)
509	SP: It was mass casualties.
511	Probably 20 dead, at least 20 or 30 wounded Iraqis.
522	SP: It just looked like, you know,
524	someone had thrown a quarter through a guy,
526	and it was just like -- there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds.
529	Everything was cauterized,
531	and it was just like there was a void going through the body.
535	This is the scene north.
539	They just removed a burnt body, or half a body from here.
543	I don't think there was anything left from his abdominal down.
550	This is blood.
553	And you know, you walk,
555	and you hear the pieces of skin.
560	And that's it, that's all that's left.
563	I remember giving three IVs, bandaging several wounded.
566	Soldiers sitting in the corner of a sandbag wall, shaking and screaming.
571	Medics who were terrified and couldn't perform.
575	I later heard that Iraqi casualties were not to be treated in Taji.
581	They can work on the post for pennies, but can't die there.
584	They've got to die outside.
589	If one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment,
593	I would've slit his throat right there.
608	going through today's events in our heads,
611	whether we want to or not.
614	News Anchor: More violence in Iraq.
616	Twin suicide car bombings killed eight Iraqis and wounded dozens more
620	near a coalition base north of Baghdad.
622	SP: We made the news.
623	I feel exploited and proud at the same time.
625	I've lost all faith in the media --
627	a hapless joke I would much rather laugh at than become a part of.
632	I should really thank God for saving my lucky ass.
635	I'll do that, then I'm gonna jerk off.
637	Because these pages smell like Linds,
639	and there won't be any time for jerking off tomorrow.
642	Another mission at 06:00.
648	DS: Now -- (Applause) -- thanks.
652	When I said earlier, to try and tell a story from the inside out, versus the outside in --
657	part of what Chris said so eloquently in his introduction -- is this melding.
662	It's a new way of trying to make a documentary.
665	When I met the guys, and 10 of them agreed to take cameras --
669	in total, 21 ended up filming.
671	Five soldiers filmed the entire time.
673	There are three featured in the film.
675	The way I learned about Taji was Steve Pink sent me an email,
679	and in it, attached a photo of that burned body out at the car.
682	And the tone from the email was,
684	you know, it had been a very bad day, obviously.
687	And I saw in my IM window that Mike Moriarty was at the base.
691	So, I pinged Mike and I said,
693	"""Mike, can you please go get that interview with Pink?"""
696	Because the thing that very often is missing is,
698	"in the military what they call ""hot wash."""
700	It's that immediate interview after something immediately happens, you know.
703	And if you let time go by,
705	it kind of softens and smooths the edges.
707	And for me, I really wanted that.
710	So, in order to get the intimacy,
712	to share that experience with you, the guys --
715	the two most popular mounts --
717	there was a camera on the turret, the gun turret,
719	and then on the dashboard of the Humvee.
721	Most of the Humvees, we ended up mounting two cameras in them.
726	So you get to experience that in real time, right?
730	The interview that you see is the one that Mike went and did
734	within 24 hours of that episode happening.
737	Steve Pink reading his journal
739	happened five months after he came home.
741	I knew about that journal, but it was very, very private.
743	And you know, you earn someone's trust,
746	especially in doc filmmaking, through your relationship.
749	So, it wasn't until five months after he was home
752	that he would read that journal.
754	Now, the news footage I put in there to try to show --
758	you know, I think mainstream media tries to do the best they can
762	in the format that they have.
764	But the thing that I know you all have heard a lot of times,
766	American soldiers saying,
768	"""Why don't they talk about the good stuff that we do?"""
770	OK, this is a perfect example.
773	Pink's squad and another squad spent their entire day outside the wire.
777	They didn't have to go outside the wire.
779	There were not Americans hurt out there.
781	They spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save Iraqi lives --
786	the Iraqis who work on the post.
788	So, when you may hear soldiers complaining,
791	that's what they're talking about, you know?
793	And I think it's such an amazing gift that they would share this
797	as a way of bridging.
799	And when I talk about that polarity I get at so many different Q&amp;As,
804	and people are really opinionated.
806	But it seems like people don't want to hear so much,
808	or listen, or try to have an exchange.
810	And I'm as fiery as the next person, but I really think --
813	you know, different speakers have talked about their concern for the world,
818	and my concern is that we have to have these conversations.
821	And we have to be able to go into scary places where we may, you know,
825	we think we know.
827	But we just have to leave that little bit of openness, to know.
831	There's such a disconnect.
833	And for me, it's trying to bridge that disconnect.
838	I'll share one story.
840	I get -- I'm often asked, you know, for me,
842	what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film.
846	And at screenings, inevitably --
848	you know, as I'm sure all of you obviously do speaking stuff --
852	usually you have people who hang around and want to ask you more questions.
856	And usually, the first questions are,
858	"""Oh, what kind of cameras did you use?"""
860	Or you know, these things.
861	But there's always a few guys, almost always, who are the last ones.
866	And I've learned over time that those are always the soldiers.
870	And they wait until pretty much everybody's gone.
874	And for me, one of the most profound stories someone shared with me,
883	that then became my story, was --
885	for those of you who haven't seen the film, and it's not a spoiler --
890	it's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents,
892	where people get in front of Humvees and they get killed.
895	In this film, there is a scene where an Iraqi woman is killed.
900	A soldier came up to me and stood, you know really, pretty close,
907	a foot away from me.
909	He's a big guy.
911	And he looked at me, and I smiled,
913	and then I saw the tears start welling up in his eyes.
918	And he wasn't going to blink.
921	"And he said, ""My gunner was throwing candy."""
924	And I knew what he was going to say.
927	The gunner was throwing candy.
930	They used to throw candy to the kids.
933	Kids got too close, very often.
936	"And he said, ""I killed a child."
939	And I'm a father. I have children.
943	I haven't been able to tell my wife.
945	"I'm afraid she's going to think I'm a monster."""
952	I hugged him, of course,
954	"and I said, you know, ""It's going to be OK."""
956	"And he said, ""I'm going to bring her to see your film."
959	"And then I'm going to tell her."""
965	So when I talk about a disconnect,
972	it's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier,
975	which there obviously are. You know, these days,
977	it's not like World War II, where there was a war front and a home front,
980	and everybody seemed involved.
982	You can go for days here and not feel like there's a war going on.
985	And often, I'll hear people say,
987	who maybe know that I did this film,
989	"and they say, ""Oh, you know, I'm against the war, but I support the soldiers."""
996	And I've started to ask them,
999	"""Well, that's nice. What are you doing?"
1002	Are you volunteering at a VA?
1005	You go and see anybody?
1007	Do you, if you find out your neighbor's been, do you spend some time?
1014	Not necessarily ask questions, but see if they want to talk?
1018	"Do you give money to any of the charities?"""
1020	You know, obviously, like Dean Kamen's working on that amazing thing,
1023	but there's charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers.
1028	I think, I challenge us to say --
1033	to operationalize those terms, when we say we support someone, you know?
1036	Are you a friend to them?
1038	Do you really care?
1040	And I would just say it's my hope, and I would ask you guys
1044	to please, you know, reach out a hand.
1050	And really do give them a hug.
1054	Thank you.
