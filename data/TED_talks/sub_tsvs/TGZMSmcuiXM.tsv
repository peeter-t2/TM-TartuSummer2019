12.693	I'm going to ask and try to answer,
14.948	in some ways, kind of an uncomfortable question.
19.846	Both civilians, obviously, and soldiers
22.2	suffer in war;
24.286	I don't think any civilian has ever missed
26.75	the war that they were subjected to.
30.112	I've been covering wars for almost 20 years,
32.13	and one of the remarkable things for me
35.458	is how many soldiers find themselves missing it.
39.342	How is it someone can go through
41.647	the worst experience imaginable,
43.984	and come home, back to their home,
45.96	and their family, their country, and miss the war?
49.421	How does that work? What does it mean?
52.992	We have to answer that question,
56.45	because if we don't, it'll be impossible
59.317	to bring soldiers back
60.585	to a place in society where they belong,
64.64	and I think it'll also be impossible to stop war,
66.893	if we don't understand how that mechanism works.
69.911	The problem is that war
73.173	does not have a simple, neat truth,
77.01	one simple, neat truth.
79.709	Any sane person hates war,
81.97	hates the idea of war,
83.825	wouldn't want to have anything to do with it,
86.402	doesn't want to be near it,
86.402	doesn't want to know about it.
89.518	That's a sane response to war.
92.202	But if I asked all of you in this room,
94.969	who here has paid money
98.327	to go to a cinema
100.313	and be entertained by a Hollywood war movie,
103.703	most of you would probably raise your hands.
107.261	That's what's so complicated about war.
109.857	And trust me, if a room full of peace-loving people
113.397	finds something compelling about war,
116.636	so do 20-year-old soldiers
119.379	who have been trained in it, I promise you.
122.641	That's the thing that has to be understood.
125.945	I've covered war for about 20 years, as I said,
128.767	but my most intense experiences in combat
131.393	were with American soldiers in Afghanistan.
135.625	I've been in Africa, the Middle East,
136.94	Afghanistan in the '90s,
138.69	but it was with American soldiers in 2007, 2008,
142.537	that I was confronted with
145.17	very intense combat.
146.69	I was in a small valley called the Korengal Valley
148.73	in eastern Afghanistan.
151.563	It was six miles long.
153.349	There were 150 men of
153.349	Battle Company in that valley,
156.491	and for a while, while I was there,
160.025	almost 20 percent of all the combat
162.301	in all of Afghanistan was happening
164.097	in those six miles.
165.93	A hundred and fifty men were absorbing
168.481	almost a fifth of the combat for all of NATO forces
171.633	in the country, for a couple months.
174.159	It was very intense.
176.296	I spent most of my time at a small outpost
178.365	called Restrepo.
179.939	It was named after the platoon medic
181.499	that had been killed about two
181.499	months into the deployment.
184.353	It was a few plywood B-huts
188.293	clinging to a side of a ridge,
192.102	and sandbags, bunkers, gun positions,
196.879	and there were 20 men up there
198.69	of Second Platoon, Battle Company.
200.775	I spent most of my time up there.
202.375	There was no running water.
203.99	There was no way to bathe.
205.001	The guys were up there for a month at a time.
207.44	They never even got out of their clothes.
209.964	They fought. The worked.
211.114	They slept in the same clothes.
213.86	They never took them off,
213.86	and at the end of the month,
215.339	they went back down to the company headquarters,
217.65	and by then, their clothes were unwearable.
219.717	They burned them and got a new set.
222.01	There was no Internet. There was no phone.
223.73	There was no communication
223.73	with the outside world up there.
227.629	There was no cooked food.
230.459	There was nothing up there
233.03	that young men typically like:
234.93	no cars, no girls, no television, nothing
238.211	except combat.
240.075	Combat they did learn to like.
244.036	I remember one day, it was a very hot day
246.487	in the spring,
248.253	and we hadn't been in a fight
250.634	in a couple of weeks, maybe.
253.08	Usually, the outpost was attacked,
255.644	and we hadn't seen any
255.644	combat in a couple of weeks,
258.507	and everyone was just stunned
261.11	with boredom and heat.
263.267	And I remember the lieutenant walking past me
267.801	sort of stripped to the waist.
269.274	It was incredibly hot.
271.676	Stripped to the waist, walked past me muttering,
274.04	"""Oh God, please someone attack us today."""
276.792	That's how bored they were.
279.142	That's war too, is a lieutenant saying,
282.208	"""Please make something happen"
284.868	"because we're going crazy."""
286.911	To understand that,
289.259	you have to, for a moment,
291.169	think about combat not morally --
293.57	that's an important job to do â€”
295.455	but for a moment, don't think about it morally,
297.348	think about it neurologically.
300.219	Let's think about what happens in your brain
302.431	when you're in combat.
304.804	First of all, the experience
307.156	is very bizarre, it's a very bizarre one.
311.77	It's not what I had expected.
314.76	Usually, you're not scared.
316.49	I've been very scared in combat,
318.61	but most of the time when I was out there,
320.712	I wasn't scared.
321.839	I was very scared beforehand
323.366	and incredibly scared afterwards,
325.281	and that fear that comes afterwards can last years.
327.883	I haven't been shot at in six years,
329.835	and I was woken up very abruptly this morning
332.188	by a nightmare that I was being strafed by aircraft,
335.433	six years later.
336.64	I've never even been strafed by aircraft,
338.374	and I was having nightmares about it.
341.75	Time slows down.
343.123	You get this weird tunnel vision.
345.347	You notice some details very, very, very accurately
349.008	and other things drop out.
351.195	It's almost a slightly altered state of mind.
354.158	What's happening in your brain
355.629	is you're getting an enormous amount of adrenaline
358.346	pumped through your system.
360.166	Young men will go to great lengths
362.76	to have that experience.
365.096	It's wired into us.
368.018	It's hormonally supported.
371.86	The mortality rate for young men in society
375.745	is six times what it is for young women
378.165	from violence and from accidents,
379.97	just the stupid stuff that young men do:
382.159	jumping off of things they shouldn't jump off of,
384.461	lighting things on fire they shouldn't light on fire,
386.88	I mean, you know what I'm talking about.
389.118	They die at six times the rate
391.159	that young women do.
392.599	Statistically, you are safer as a teenage boy,
396.503	you would be safer in the fire department
399.146	or the police department in most American cities
401.71	than just walking around the
401.71	streets of your hometown
404.232	looking for something to do,
406.59	statistically.
409.65	You can imagine how that plays out in combat.
412.888	At Restrepo, every guy up there was almost killed,
415.95	including me,
417.644	including my good friend Tim Hetherington,
419.704	who was later killed in Libya.
422.126	There were guys walking around
423.802	with bullet holes in their uniforms,
425.623	rounds that had cut through the fabric
427.51	and didn't touch their bodies.
430.892	I was leaning against some sandbags one morning,
433.974	not much going on, sort of spacing out,
436.971	and some sand was kicked into the side of,
440.478	sort of hit the side of my face.
443.148	Something hit the side of my face,
443.148	and I didn't know what it was.
445.361	You have to understand about bullets
446.9	that they go a lot faster than sound,
448.798	so if someone shoots at you
450.211	from a few hundred meters,
452.268	the bullet goes by you, or hits you obviously,
455.411	half a second or so before
455.411	the sound catches up to it.
458.063	So I had some sand sprayed in the side of my face.
460.95	Half a second later, I heard dut-dut-dut-dut-duh.
462.95	It was machine gun fire.
463.964	It was the first round, the first burst
466.31	of an hour-long firefight.
469.173	What had happened was the bullet hit,
472.238	a bullet hit three or four inches
472.238	from the side of my head.
475.981	Imagine, just think about it, because I certainly did,
480.63	think about the angle of deviation that saved my life.
482.51	At 400 meters, it missed me by three inches.
484.972	Just think about the math on that.
489.268	Every guy up there
491.052	had some experience like that,
492.974	at least once, if not many times.
496.502	The boys are up there for a year.
498.982	They got back.
500.751	Some of them got out of the Army
502.11	and had tremendous psychological
502.11	problems when they got home.
504.704	Some of them stayed in the Army
506.239	and were more or less okay, psychologically.
509.862	I was particularly close to a
509.862	guy named Brendan O'Byrne.
512.939	I'm still very good friends with him.
514.827	He came back to the States. He got out of the Army.
517.883	I had a dinner party one night.
519.851	I invited him,
521.645	and he started talking with a woman,
525.08	one of my friends,
526.317	and she knew how bad it had been out there,
529.369	"and she said, ""Brendan,"
531.118	is there anything at all that you miss about
534.446	"being out in Afghanistan, about the war?"""
538	And he thought about it quite a long time,
541.169	"and finally he said, ""Ma'am, I miss almost all of it."""
546.552	And he's one of the most traumatized people
549.994	I've seen from that war.
553.083	"""Ma'am, I miss almost all of it."""
555.094	What is he talking about?
558.179	He's not a psychopath.
561.621	He doesn't miss killing people.
563.28	He's not crazy. He doesn't miss getting shot at
565.56	and seeing his friends get killed.
567.262	What is it that he misses? We have to answer that.
571.09	If we're going to stop war, we
571.09	have to answer that question.
577.816	I think what he missed is brotherhood.
582.994	He missed, in some ways,
584.75	the opposite of killing.
586.146	What he missed was connection
588.478	to the other men he was with.
590.826	Now, brotherhood is different from friendship.
593.342	Friendship happens in society, obviously.
597.096	The more you like someone,
598.634	the more you'd be willing to do for them.
600.708	Brotherhood has nothing to do
602.214	with how you feel about the other person.
605.706	It's a mutual agreement in a group
608.688	that you will put the welfare of the group,
610.93	you will put the safety of everyone in the group
612.95	above your own.
614.81	In effect, you're saying,
618.187	"""I love these other people more than I love myself."""
623.602	Brendan was a team leader
625	in command of three men,
626.863	and the worst day in Afghanistan â€”
630.3	He was almost killed so many times.
633.179	It didn't bother him.
634.514	The worst thing that happened to him in Afghanistan
637.092	was one of his men was hit in the head with a bullet
639.908	in the helmet, knocked him over.
644.392	They thought he was dead.
645.52	It was in the middle of a huge firefight.
646.97	No one could deal with it, and a minute later,
648.99	Kyle Steiner sat back up
651.03	from the dead, as it were,
652.955	because he'd come back to consciousness.
654.98	The bullet had just knocked him out.
656.252	It glanced off the helmet.
658.179	He remembers people saying,
660.245	as he was sort of half-conscious,
661.707	he remembers people saying,
665.206	"""Steiner's been hit in the head. Steiner's dead."""
667.277	"And he was thinking, ""I'm not dead."""
668.899	And he sat up.
670.647	And Brendan realized after that
672.844	that he could not protect his men,
674.485	and that was the only time he cried in Afghanistan,
676.863	was realizing that.
679.828	That's brotherhood.
682.34	This wasn't invented recently.
684.772	"Many of you have probably read ""The Iliad."""
687.269	Achilles surely would have risked his life
689.24	or given his life to save his friend Patroclus.
694.018	In World War II, there were many stories
696.956	of soldiers who were wounded,
700.032	were brought to a rear base hospital,
702.099	who went AWOL,
703.455	crawled out of windows, slipped out doors,
705.675	went AWOL, wounded,
709.273	to make their way back to the front lines
710.675	to rejoin their brothers out there.
713.311	So you think about Brendan,
715.66	you think about all these soldiers
719.016	having an experience like that, a bond like that,
721.901	in a small group,
723.781	where they loved 20 other people
725.679	in some ways more than they loved themselves,
728.598	you think about how good that would feel, imagine it,
733.714	and they are blessed with that experience for a year,
738.344	and then they come home,
739.833	and they are just back in society
742.82	like the rest of us are,
745.659	not knowing who they can count on,
748.085	not knowing who loves them, who they can love,
753.262	not knowing exactly what anyone they know
755.853	would do for them if it came down to it.
758.087	That is terrifying.
761.673	Compared to that,
763.663	war, psychologically, in some ways, is easy,
767.737	compared to that kind of alienation.
770.234	That's why they miss it,
771.624	and that's what we have to understand
774.102	and in some ways fix in our society.
777.505	Thank you very much.
780.435	(Applause)
