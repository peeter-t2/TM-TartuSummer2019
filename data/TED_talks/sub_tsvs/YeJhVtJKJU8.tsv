18.49	This is a river.
21.117	This is a stream.
23.65	This is a river.
26.004	This is happening all over the country.
28.615	There are tens of thousands of miles
28.615	of dewatered streams in the United States.
33.516	On this map, the colored areas
33.516	represent water conflicts.
39.26	Similar problems
39.26	are emerging in the East as well.
43.051	The reasons vary state to state,
43.051	but mostly in the details.
47.167	There are 4,000 miles
47.167	of dewatered streams in Montana alone.
52.915	They would ordinarily
52.915	support fish and other wildlife.
56.505	They're the veins of the ecosystem,
59.489	and they're often empty veins.
63.224	I want to tell you the story
63.224	of just one of these streams,
66.495	because it's an archetype
66.495	for the larger story.
69.959	This is Prickly Pear Creek.
71.723	It runs through a populated area
71.723	from East Helena to Lake Helena.
77.2	It supports wild fish including cutthroat,
77.2	brown and rainbow trout.
82.876	Nearly every year
82.876	for more than a hundred years ...
88.39	it looked like this in the summer.
90.603	How did we get here?
93.087	Well, it started back in the late 1800s
96.286	when people started settling
96.286	in places like Montana.
99.55	In short, there was a lot of water
99.55	and there weren't very many people.
104.351	But as more people
104.351	showed up wanting water,
106.385	the folks who were there first
106.385	got a little concerned,
109.362	and in 1865, Montana passed
109.362	its first water law.
114.014	It basically said, everybody
114.014	near the stream can share in the stream.
118.569	Oddly, a lot of people showed up
118.569	wanting to share the stream,
121.551	and the folks who were there first
123.202	got concerned enough
123.202	to bring out their lawyers.
125.894	There were precedent-setting suits
125.894	in 1870 and 1872,
129.385	both involving Prickly Pear Creek.
132.01	And in 1921,
133.26	the Montana Supreme Court
133.26	ruled in a case involving Prickly Pear
138.359	that the folks who were there first
138.359	"had the first, or ""senior water rights."""
144.824	These senior water rights are key.
148.066	The problem is that all over the West
148.066	now it looks like this.
151.925	Some of these creeks have claims
153.73	for 50 to 100 times more water
153.73	than is actually in the stream.
158.568	And the senior water rights holders,
158.568	if they don't use their water right,
163.438	they risk losing their water right --
166.333	along with the economic value
166.333	that goes with it.
169.034	So they have no incentive to conserve.
172.44	So it's not just
172.44	about the number of people;
175.781	the system itself creates
175.781	a disincentive to conserve
179.194	because you can lose your water
179.194	right if you don't use it.
183.559	So after decades of lawsuits
183.559	and 140 years, now, of experience,
187.578	we still have this.
191.103	It's a broken system.
192.904	There's a disincentive to conserve,
194.928	because if you don't use your water right,
194.928	you can lose your water right.
198.543	And I'm sure you all know,
198.543	this has created significant conflicts
201.796	between the agricultural
201.796	and environmental communities.
205.811	OK, now I'm going to change gears here.
209.225	Most of you will be happy to know that
209.225	the rest of the presentation's free ...
212.994	(Laughter)
214.045	and some of you'll be happy
214.045	to know that it involves beer.
216.853	(Laughter)
219.848	There's another thing
219.848	happening around the country,
222.322	which is that companies
222.322	are starting to get concerned
224.837	about their water footprint.
226.495	They're concerned about securing
226.495	an adequate supply of water,
229.607	they're trying to be really efficient
229.607	with their water use,
232.514	and they're concerned
232.514	about how their water use
234.75	affects the image of their brand.
237.529	Well, it's a national problem,
239.104	but I'm going to tell you
239.104	another story from Montana ...
241.808	and it involves beer.
243.985	I bet you didn't know,
243.985	it takes about 5 pints of water
246.956	to make a pint of beer.
248.593	If you include all the drain,
250.586	it takes more than a hundred pints
250.586	of water to make a pint of beer.
254.161	Now the brewers in Montana
255.633	have already done a lot
255.633	to reduce their water consumption,
259.587	but they still use
259.587	millions of gallons of water.
261.876	I mean, there's water in beer.
265.428	So what can they do
265.428	about this remaining water footprint
271.759	that can have serious effects
271.759	on the ecosystem?
275.436	These ecosystems are really important
277.748	to the Montana brewers
277.748	and their customers.
279.81	After all, there's a strong correlation
279.81	between water and fishing,
283.479	and for some, there's a strong correlation
283.479	between fishing and beer.
287.73	(Laughter)
289.261	So the Montana brewers
289.261	and their customers are concerned
292.885	and they're looking for some way
292.885	to address the problem.
295.586	So how can they address
295.586	this remaining water footprint?
299.229	Remember Prickly Pear.
300.758	Up until now, business water stewardship
304.961	has been limited
304.961	to measuring and reducing,
309.235	and we're suggesting
309.235	that the next step is to restore.
313.383	Remember Prickly Pear.
314.579	It's a broken system.
315.827	You've got a disincentive to conserve,
317.894	because if you don't use your water right,
317.894	you risk losing your water right.
321.663	Well, we decided to connect
321.663	these two worlds --
324.074	the world of the companies
324.074	with their water footprints
327.419	and the world of the farmers
329.05	with their senior water rights
329.05	on these creeks.
331.523	In some states,
333.584	senior water rights holders
333.584	can leave their water in the stream
338.26	while legally protecting it from others,
342.303	and maintaining their water right.
346	After all, it is their water right,
348.438	and if they want to use that water right
348.438	to help the fish grow in the stream,
352.981	it's their right to do so.
355.395	But they have no incentive to do so.
360.062	So, working with local water trusts,
360.062	we created an incentive to do so.
365.36	We pay them to leave
365.36	their water in stream.
369.536	That's what's happening here.
370.954	This individual has made the choice
370.954	and is closing this water diversion,
375.781	leaving the water in the stream.
377.98	He doesn't lose the water right,
379.645	he just chooses to apply that right,
379.645	or some portion of it,
384.438	to the stream, instead of to the land.
387.692	Because he's the senior
387.692	water-rights holder,
390.097	he can protect the water
390.097	from other users in the stream.
394.21	OK?
395.534	He gets paid to leave
395.534	the water in the stream.
399.468	This guy's measuring the water
399.468	that this leaves in the stream.
403.825	We then take the measured water,
406.335	we divide it into
406.335	thousand-gallon increments.
409.5	Each increment gets a serial number
409.5	and a certificate,
413.158	and then the brewers and others
413.158	buy those certificates
416.57	as a way to return water
416.57	to these degraded ecosystems.
420.659	The brewers pay
420.659	to restore water to the stream.
425.932	It provides a simple,
425.932	inexpensive and measurable way
430.133	to return water
430.133	to these degraded ecosystems,
432.867	while giving farmers an economic choice
435.784	and giving businesses
435.784	concerned about their water footprints
438.692	an easy way to deal with them.
440.737	After 140 years of conflict
440.737	and 100 years of dry streams,
447.576	a circumstance that litigation
447.576	and regulation has not solved,
453.047	we put together a market-based,
453.047	willing buyer, willing seller solution --
457.253	a solution that
457.253	does not require litigation.
461.735	It's about giving folks
461.735	concerned about their water footprints
466.641	a real opportunity to put water
466.641	where it's critically needed,
471.246	into these degraded ecosystems,
473.768	while at the same time providing farmers
473.768	a meaningful economic choice
479.523	about how their water is used.
481.456	These transactions
481.456	create allies, not enemies.
484.163	They connect people
484.163	rather than dividing them.
486.642	And they provide needed economic
486.642	support for rural communities.
490.38	And most importantly, it's working.
492.388	We've returned more than four billion
492.388	gallons of water to degraded ecosystems.
497.081	We've connected senior
497.081	water-rights holders
499.134	with brewers in Montana,
500.606	with hotels and tea companies in Oregon,
503.342	and with high-tech companies
503.342	that use a lot of water in the Southwest.
506.971	And when we make these connections,
509.383	we can and we do turn this ...
513.223	into this.
514.823	(Applause)
516.217	Thank you very much.
517.694	(Applause)
