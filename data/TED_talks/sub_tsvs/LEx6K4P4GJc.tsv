13.157	Food crisis.
14.445	It's in the news every day.
16.047	But what is it?
17.393	Some places in the world
17.393	it's too little food,
20.316	maybe too much.
21.963	Other places, GMO is saving the world.
24.821	Maybe GMO is the problem?
27.355	Too much agricultural runoff
27.355	creating bad oceans, toxic oceans,
30.841	attenuation of nutrition.
32.836	They go on and on.
34.919	And I find the current climate
34.919	of this discussion
38.168	incredibly disempowering.
41.11	So how do we bring that
41.11	to something that we understand?
45.508	How is this apple food crisis?
48.194	You've all eaten an apple
48.194	in the last week, I'm sure.
51.468	How old do you think it was
51.468	from when it was picked?
55.264	Two weeks?
56.472	Two months?
58.887	Eleven months --
60.064	the average age of an apple
60.064	in a grocery store in the United States.
63.443	And I don't expect it
63.443	to be much different in Europe
65.966	or anywhere else in the world.
67.47	We pick them,
68.658	we put them in cold storage,
70.759	we gas the cold storage --
72.051	there's actually documented proof
73.972	of workers trying to go
73.972	into these environments
76.239	to retrieve an apple,
77.857	and dying,
79.606	because the atmosphere
80.785	that they slow down the process
80.785	of the apple with is also toxic to humans.
85.152	How is it that none of you knew this?
87.075	Why didn't I know this?
89.086	Ninety percent of the quality
89.086	of that apple --
91.318	all of the antioxidants -- are gone
91.318	by the time we get it.
94.719	It's basically a little ball of sugar.
98.126	How did we get so information poor
100.932	and how can we do better?
103.347	I think what's missing is a platform.
106.63	I know platforms -- I know computers,
108.463	they put me on the Internet
108.463	when I was young.
110.606	I did very weird things --
111.876	(Laughter)
112.901	on this platform.
114.076	But I met people,
114.076	and I could express myself.
116.193	How do you express yourself in food?
118.556	If we had a platform,
120.12	we might feel empowered
120.12	to question: What if?
124.005	For me, I questioned:
125.18	What if climate was democratic?
129.83	So, this is a map of climate in the world.
131.861	The most productive areas in green,
131.861	the least productive in red.
135.606	They shift and they change,
136.938	and Californian farmers
136.938	now become Mexican farmers.
139.934	China picks up land in Brazil
139.934	to grow better food,
142.855	and we're a slave to climate.
146.056	What if each country had
146.056	its own productive climate?
149.612	What would that change about how we live?
152.233	What would that change
152.233	about quality of life and nutrition?
156.257	The last generation's problem
156.257	was, we need more food
159.576	and we need it cheap.
161.194	Welcome to your global farm.
163.338	We built a huge analog farm.
165.822	All these traces --
167.276	these are cars, planes,
167.276	trains and automobiles.
170.597	It's a miracle that we feed
170.597	seven billion people
173.806	with just a few of us involved
173.806	in the production of food.
177.709	What if ...
179.758	we built a digital farm?
181.458	A digital world farm.
182.645	What if you could take this apple,
186.052	digitize it somehow,
187.786	send it through particles in the air
190.278	and reconstitute it on the other side?
193.337	What if?
195.338	Going through some of these quotes,
197.037	you know, they inspire me to do what I do.
199.103	First one:
200.282	"[""Japanese farming has no youth,"
200.282	"no water, no land and no future.""]"
204.767	That's what I landed to the day
204.767	that I went to Minamisanriku,
208.529	one stop south of Fukushima,
210.126	after the disaster.
211.852	The kids have headed to Sendai and Tokyo,
214.427	the land is contaminated,
215.826	they already import 70 percent
215.826	of their own food.
218.171	But it's not unique to Japan.
220.749	Two percent of the American population
220.749	is involved in farming.
225.091	What good answer comes
225.091	from two percent of any population?
229.725	As we go around the world,
	population is under 18.
235.905	Eighty percent don't want to be farmers.
238.745	Farming is hard.
240.651	The life of a small-shareholder
240.651	farmer is miserable.
245.381	They go into the city.
246.697	In India:
248.523	farmers' families not being able
248.523	to have basic access to utilities,
251.737	more farmer suicides this year
251.737	and the previous 10 before that.
255.56	It's uncomfortable to talk about.
257.219	Where are they going?
258.411	Into the city.
260.719	No young people, and everyone's headed in.
262.911	So how do we build this platform
262.911	that inspires the youth?
267.687	Welcome to the new tractor.
269.754	This is my combine.
272.224	A number of years ago now,
273.547	I went to Bed Bath and Beyond
273.547	and Home Depot
275.733	and I started hacking.
276.908	And I built silly things
278.147	and I made plants dance
279.322	and I attached them to my computer
281.197	and I killed them all --
282.966	a lot.
284.163	(Laughter)
285.773	I eventually got them to survive.
287.407	And I created one of the most
287.407	intimate relationships
289.897	I've ever had in my life,
291.136	because I was learning
291.136	the language of plants.
295.008	I wanted to make it bigger.
296.35	"They said, ""Knock yourself out, kid!"
298.137	Here's an old electronics room
298.137	that nobody wants.
301.062	"What can you do?"""
303.031	With my team, we built a farm
303.031	inside of the media lab,
305.682	a place historically known
305.682	not for anything about biology
309.64	but everything about digital life.
312.213	Inside of these 60 square feet,
314.879	we produced enough food to feed
314.879	about 300 people once a month --
318.029	not a lot of food.
319.205	And there's a lot of interesting
319.205	technology in there.
321.744	But the most interesting thing?
324.226	Beautiful, white roots,
326.478	deep, green colors
329.629	and a monthly harvest.
331.668	Is this a new cafeteria?
334.787	Is this a new retail experience?
338.132	Is this a new grocery store?
339.73	I can tell you one thing for sure:
342.127	this is the first time
343.301	anybody in the media lab
343.301	ripped the roots off of anything.
346.613	(Laughter)
348.528	We get our salad in bags;
350.257	there's nothing wrong with that.
352.4	But what happens
353.945	when you have an image-based
353.945	processing expert,
357.08	a data scientist,
358.996	a roboticist,
360.933	ripping roots off and thinking,
362.483	"""Huh. I know something about --"
364.387	"I could make this happen, I want to try."""
367.364	In that process we would
367.364	bring the plants out
369.663	and we would take some back to the lab,
371.596	because if you grew it,
371.596	you don't throw it away;
373.876	it's kind of precious to you.
375.297	I have this weird tongue now,
376.718	because I'm afraid to let anybody eat
376.718	anything until I've eaten it first,
380.186	because I want it to be good.
381.599	So I eat lettuce every day
382.869	and I can tell the pH
382.869	of a lettuce within .1.
385.35	(Laughter)
386.379	"I'm like, ""No, that's 6.1 -- no,"
386.379	"no, you can't eat it today."""
389.574	(Applause)
394.042	This lettuce that day was hyper sweet.
397.362	It was hyper sweet
397.362	because the plant had been stressed
399.934	and it created a chemical reaction
399.934	in the plant to protect itself:
403.087	"""I'm not going to die!"""
404.275	And the plants not-going-to-die,
404.275	taste sweet to me.
408.683	Technologists falling backwards
408.683	into plant physiology.
411.569	So we thought other people
411.569	needed to be able to try this.
414.298	We want to see what people can create,
416.179	so we conceived of a lab
416.179	that could be shipped anywhere.
419.359	And then we built it.
422.095	So on the facade
422.095	of the media lab is my lab,
424.742	that has about 30 points
424.742	of sensing per plant.
428.035	If you know about the genome or genetics,
431.228	this is the phenome, right?
433.755	The phenomena.
435.021	"When you say, ""I like"
435.021	"the strawberries from Mexico,"""
437.525	you really like the strawberries
437.525	from the climate
439.938	that produced the expression
439.938	that you like.
442.05	So if you're coding climate --
444.263	this much CO2, this much O2 creates
444.263	a recipe -- you're coding
447.588	the expression of that plant,
447.588	the nutrition of that plant,
450.887	the size of that plant, the shape,
450.887	the color, the texture.
455.683	We need data,
456.892	so we put a bunch of sensors in there
458.697	to tell us what's going on.
460.024	If you think of your houseplants,
461.63	and you look at your houseplant
463.149	and you're super sad, because you're like,
465.185	"""Why are you dying? Won't you talk to me?"""
467.225	(Laughter)
468.659	Farmers develop the most beautiful
468.659	fortune-telling eyes
471.505	by the time they're in their
471.505	late 60s and 70s.
473.7	They can tell you when you
473.7	see that plant dying
475.917	that it's a nitrogen deficiency,
475.917	a calcium deficiency
478.48	or it needs more humidity.
479.908	Those beautiful eyes
479.908	are not being passed down.
483.199	These are eyes in the cloud of a farmer.
486.08	We trend those data points over time.
488.805	We correlate those data points
488.805	to individual plants.
491.304	These are all the broccoli
491.304	in my lab that day, by IP address.
495.378	(Laughter)
496.54	We have IP-addressable broccoli.
500.176	(Applause)
504.714	So if that's not weird enough,
507.413	you can click one
507.413	and you get a plant profile.
509.926	And what this tells you
509.926	is downloadable progress on that plant,
512.966	but not like you'd think,
514.196	it's not just when it's ready.
515.665	When does it achieve
515.665	the nutrition that I need?
517.965	When does it achieve
517.965	the taste that I desire?
521.284	Is it getting too much water?
522.984	Is it getting too much sun?
524.92	Alerts.
526.108	It can talk to me, it's conversant,
527.966	we have a language.
530.043	(Laughter)
531.855	(Applause)
536.515	I think of that as the first user
536.515	on the plant Facebook, right?
541.318	That's a plant profile
542.548	and that plant will start making friends.
544.565	(Laughter)
545.596	And I mean it -- it will make
545.596	friends with other plants
548.239	that use less nitrogen, more phosphorus,
550.39	less potassium.
551.91	We're going to learn about a complexity
553.915	that we can only guess at now.
556.048	And they may not friend us back --
556.048	I don't know, they might friend us back,
559.652	it depends on how we act.
560.875	So this is my lab now.
563.294	It's a little bit more systematized,
565.056	my background is designing data centers
565.056	in hospitals of all things,
568.311	so I know a little bit about creating
568.311	a controlled environment.
571.303	And so --
572.754	inside of this environment,
574.421	we're experimenting
574.421	with all kinds of things.
576.818	This process, aeroponics, was developed
576.818	by NASA for Mir Space Station
581.05	for reducing the amount of water
581.05	they send into space.
583.622	What it really does is give the plant
583.622	exactly what it wants:
586.505	water, minerals and oxygen.
588.164	Roots are not that complicated,
589.68	so when you give them that,
589.68	you get this amazing expression.
594.472	It's like the plant has two hearts.
597.569	And because it has two hearts,
599.958	it grows four or five times faster.
602.657	It's a perfect world.
603.835	We've gone a long way into technology
603.835	and seed for an adverse world
607.072	and we're going to continue to do that,
608.961	but we're going to have a new tool, too,
610.898	which is perfect world.
612.605	So we've grown all kinds of things.
614.308	These tomatoes hadn't been
614.308	in commercial production for 150 years.
618.515	Do you know that we have
618.515	rare and ancient seed banks?
622.312	Banks of seed.
624.078	It's amazing.
625.259	They have germplasm alive
625.259	and things that you've never eaten.
628.165	I am the only person in this room
628.165	that's eaten that kind of tomato.
631.837	Problem is it was a sauce tomato
631.837	and we don't know how to cook,
634.862	so we ate a sauce tomato,
634.862	which is not that great.
637.242	But we've done things with protein --
637.242	we've grown all kinds of things.
640.582	We've grown humans --
641.779	(Laughter)
644.103	Well maybe you could, but we didn't.
645.859	But what we realized is,
647.479	the tool was too big,
647.479	it was too expensive.
649.578	I was starting to put them
649.578	around the world
651.606	and they were about 100,000 dollars.
653.447	Finding somebody with 100 grand
653.447	in their back pocket isn't easy,
656.48	so we wanted to make a small one.
658.084	This project was actually
658.084	one of my student's --
660.405	mechanical engineering
660.405	undergraduate, Camille.
663.851	So Camille and I and my team,
665.407	we iterated all summer,
667.289	how to make it cheaper,
667.289	how to make it work better,
669.733	how to make it so other
669.733	people can make it.
671.781	Then we dropped them off in schools,
671.781	seventh through eleventh grade.
675.108	And if you want to be humbled,
675.108	try to teach a kid something.
678.131	So I went into this school and I said,
680.004	"""Set it to 65 percent humidity."""
681.921	The seventh grader
681.921	"said, ""What's humidity?"""
684.211	"And I said, ""Oh, it's water in air."""
686.1	"He said, ""There's no water"
686.1	"in air, you're an idiot."""
688.568	(Laughter)
689.611	"And I was like, ""Alright, don't trust me."
691.644	Actually -- don't trust me, right?
693.327	Set it to 100.
694.502	He sets it to 100 and what happens?
696.231	It starts to condense, make a fog
696.231	and eventually drip.
699.457	"And he says, ""Oh. Humidity is rain."
703.372	"Why didn't you just tell me that?"""
705.026	(Laughter)
707.489	We've created an interface
707.489	for this that's much like a game.
710.356	They have a 3D environment,
711.696	they can log into it anywhere in the world
713.736	on their smartphone, on their tablet.
715.543	They have different parts of the bots --
715.543	the physical, the sensors.
718.994	They select recipes that have
718.994	been created by other kids
721.658	anywhere in the world.
722.832	They select and activate that recipe,
722.832	they plant a seedling.
726.324	While it's growing, they make changes.
728.185	"They're like, ""Why does a plant"
728.185	need CO2 anyway? Isn't CO2 bad?
731.218	"It kills people."""
732.393	Crank up CO2, plant dies.
734.404	Or crank down CO2, plant does very well.
737.425	Harvest plant,
739.13	and you've created a new digital recipe.
741.821	It's an iterative design and development
743.935	and exploration process.
745.871	They can download, then,
747.307	all of the data about that new plant
747.307	that they developed
750.048	or the new digital recipe
750.048	and what did it do --
752.358	was it better or was it worse?
753.826	Imagine these as little cores
753.826	of processing.
756.771	We're going to learn so much.
759.764	Here's one of the food computers,
759.764	as we call them,
762.486	in a school in three weeks' time.
765.793	This is three weeks of growth.
767.256	But more importantly,
769.124	it was the first time that this kid
769.124	ever thought he could be a farmer --
773.658	or that he would want to be a farmer.
776.187	So, we've open-sourced all of this.
778.226	It's all online; go home, try to build
778.226	your first food computer.
781.336	It's going to be difficult --
781.336	I'm just telling you.
783.749	We're in the beginning,
783.749	but it's all there.
785.837	It's very important to me
785.837	that this is easily accessible.
788.56	We're going to keep making it more so.
790.946	These are farmers,
793.016	electrical engineer, mechanical engineer,
795.017	environmental engineer,
795.017	computer scientist,
797.074	plant scientist,
797.074	economist, urban planners.
800.214	On one platform, doing
800.214	what they're good at.
802.992	But we got a little too big.
804.84	This is my new facility
804.84	that I'm just starting.
807.696	This warehouse could be anywhere.
810.088	That's why I chose it.
811.718	And inside of this warehouse
813.365	we're going to build something
813.365	kind of like this.
815.758	These exist right now.
817.244	Take a look at it.
820.053	These exist, too.
822.034	One grows greens,
823.338	one grows Ebola vaccine.
826.212	Pretty amazing that plants
826.212	and this DARPA Grand Challenge winner
830.15	is one of the reasons
830.15	we're getting ahead of Ebola.
833.13	The plants are producing
833.13	the protein that's Ebola resistant.
837.083	So pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals,
839.645	all they way down to lettuce.
841.62	But these two things look nothing alike,
843.582	and that's where I am with my field.
845.883	Everything is different.
847.629	"We're in that weird ""We're alright"" stage"
850.963	"and it's like, ""Here's my black box --"""
852.85	"""No, buy mine."""
854.025	"""No, no, no -- I've got intellectual"
854.025	property that's totally valuable.
857.41	"Don't buy his, buy mine."""
858.634	And the reality is,
858.634	we're just at the beginning,
860.943	in a time when society is shifting, too.
863.11	When we ask for more, cheaper food,
864.849	we're now asking for better,
864.849	environmentally friendly food.
868.654	And when you have McDonald's advertising
868.654	what's in the Chicken McNugget,
873.991	the most mysterious
873.991	food item of all time --
876.11	they are now basing
876.11	their marketing plan on that --
878.871	everything is changing.
880.365	So into the world now.
881.911	Personal food computers,
884.764	food servers
887.261	and food data centers
890.434	run on the open phenome.
893.245	Think open genome, but we're going
893.245	to put little climate recipes,
896.498	like Wikipedia,
897.683	that you can pull down, actuate and grow.
903.275	What does this look like in a world?
905.029	You remember the world
905.029	connected by strings?
907.188	We start having beacons.
909.338	We start sending information about food,
911.448	rather than sending food.
913.249	This is not just my fantasy,
914.991	this is where we're already deploying.
917.578	Food computers, food servers,
919.291	soon-to-be food data centers,
920.751	connecting people together
920.751	to share information.
924.723	The future of food is not about fighting
924.723	over what's wrong with this.
930.556	We know what's wrong with this.
933.128	The future of food is about networking
933.128	the next one billion farmers
937.667	and empowering them with a platform
939.965	to ask and answer the question,
942.693	"""What if?"""
944.052	Thank you.
945.247	(Applause)
