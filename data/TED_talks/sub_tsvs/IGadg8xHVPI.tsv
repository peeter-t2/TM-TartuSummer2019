15.513	Basking sharks are awesome creatures.
17.714	They are just magnificent.
19.061	They grow 10 meters long; some say bigger.
22.633	They might weigh up to two tons.
24.672	Some say up to five tons.
26.26	They're the second-largest
26.26	fish in the world.
28.537	They're also harmless
28.537	plankton-feeding animals.
31.173	And they are thought to be able to filter
31.173	a cubic kilometer of water every hour
36.633	and can feed on 30 kilos
36.633	of zoo plankton a day to survive.
41.394	They're fantastic creatures.
42.783	We're very lucky in Ireland,
44.164	we have plenty of basking sharks
44.164	and plenty of opportunities to study them.
47.768	They were very important
47.768	to coastal communities,
50.09	going back hundreds of years,
51.55	especially around
51.55	the Claddaghduff, Connemara region
54.326	where subsistence farmers used to sail
54.326	out on their hookers and open boats,
57.948	sometimes way offshore
57.948	to a place called the Sunfish Bank,
60.699	about 30 miles west of Achill Island,
62.5	to kill the basking sharks.
63.817	This is a woodcut from about the 1800s.
66.013	They were very important,
66.013	for the oil out of their liver.
68.788	A third of the basking
68.788	shark's size is their liver,
71.274	and it's full of oil, gallons of oil.
73.081	That oil was used especially for lighting,
75.194	but also for dressing wounds
75.194	and other things.
77.391	In fact, the streetlights in 1742,
79.301	of Galway, Dublin and Waterford,
80.849	were lit with sunfish oil.
82.26	"""Sunfish"" is one of the words"
82.26	for basking sharks.
84.674	So they were incredibly important animals.
86.714	They've been around a long time,
86.714	very important to coastal communities.
90.107	Probably the best-documented
90.107	basking shark fishery in the world
93.425	is that from Achill Island.
94.961	This is Keem Bay up in Achill Island.
97.36	Sharks used to come into the bay,
99.537	and the fishermen
99.537	would tie a net off the headland,
102.562	string it out, an old Manila net,
104.218	and as the shark came round,
104.218	it would hit the net,
106.591	the net would collapse on it.
108.011	It would often drown and suffocate.
109.73	Or at times, they would row out
109.73	in their small curraghs
112.609	and kill it with a lance
112.609	through the back of the neck.
115.167	And then they'd tow the sharks
115.167	back to Purteen Harbour,
117.935	boil them up, use the oil.
119.683	They also used the flesh
119.683	as well, for fertilizer
123.631	and also would fin the sharks.
126.551	This is probably the biggest threat
126.551	to sharks worldwide --
129.416	the finning of sharks.
131.479	We're often frightened
131.479	"of sharks, thanks to ""Jaws."""
133.992	Maybe five or six people
133.992	get killed by sharks every year.
137.07	There was someone recently, wasn't there?
137.07	Just a couple weeks ago.
140.269	We kill about 100 million sharks a year.
142.26	So I don't know what the balance is,
144.26	but I think sharks have more right
144.26	to be fearful of us than we have of them.
148.278	It was a well-documented fishery.
149.931	As you can see here,
149.931	it peaked in the '50s,
152.158	where they were killing
152.158	1,500 sharks a year.
154.279	And it declined very fast --
154.279	a classic boom-and-bust fishery,
157.237	which suggests that a stock
157.237	has been depleted
159.933	or there's low reproductive rates.
161.895	They killed about 12,000 sharks
161.895	within this period,
164.389	literally just by stringing a Manila rope
167.343	off the tip of Keem Bay
167.343	up in Achill Island.
170.437	Sharks were still killed
170.437	up into the mid-80s,
172.874	especially out of places
172.874	like Dunmore East in County Waterford.
175.911	About two and a half, 3,000
175.911	sharks were killed up till '85,
178.764	mainly by Norwegian vessels.
180.482	You can't really see,
181.66	but these are Norwegian
181.66	basking shark hunting vessels.
184.223	The black line in the crow's nest
184.223	signifies this is a shark vessel,
187.802	rather than a whaling vessel.
189.898	The importance of basking sharks
189.898	to the coast communities
192.767	is recognized through the language.
194.469	I don't pretend
194.469	to [know many Irish words],
196.778	but in Kerry they were often
196.778	"known as ""ainmhide Na seolta,"""
200.36	"""the monster with the sails."""
202.361	"Another title would be ""liop an dá lapa,"""
205.389	"""the unwieldy beast with two fins."""
208.08	"""Liabhán mór,"" suggesting a big animal."
211.119	"Or my favorite, ""liabhán chor gréine,"""
211.119	"""the great fish of the sun."""
214.646	That's a lovely, evocative name.
216.206	On Tory Island -- a strange place
216.206	"anyway -- they were known as ""muldoons."""
219.76	(Laughter)
220.805	No one seems to know why.
222.024	Hope there's no one
222.024	from Tory here. Lovely place.
224.383	But more commonly all around the island,
224.383	they were known as the sunfish.
228.43	And this represents their habit
228.43	of basking on the surface
231.163	when the sun is out.
232.345	There's great concern
232.345	that basking sharks are depleted
234.932	all throughout the world.
236.469	Some say it's not population decline,
238.486	it might be a change
238.486	in the distribution of plankton.
240.999	It's been suggested
242.18	that these sharks would make
242.18	fantastic indicators of climate change,
245.428	as they're basically
245.428	continuous plankton recorders,
247.863	swimming around with their mouth open.
249.707	They're now listed
249.707	as vulnerable under the IUCN.
252.016	There's movements in Europe
252.016	to try and stop catching them.
255	There's now a ban on catching
255	and even landing them,
257.48	even landing ones caught accidentally.
259.569	They're not protected in Ireland;
261.181	in fact, they have no legislative
261.181	status in Ireland whatsoever,
264.19	despite our importance for the species
266.144	and also the historical context
266.144	within which basking sharks reside.
269.722	We know very little about them.
271.96	And most of what we do know
273.385	is based on their habit
273.385	of coming to the surface --
276.195	we try and guess what they're doing
276.195	from their behavior on the surface.
279.621	I only found out last year,
279.621	at a conference on the Isle of Man,
282.713	just how unusual it is to live somewhere
285.451	where basking sharks regularly,
285.451	frequently and predictably
289.022	"come to the surface to ""bask."""
291.986	It's a fantastic opportunity
291.986	for a scientist
294.105	to see and experience basking sharks.
295.93	They are awesome creatures.
297.303	It gives us a fantastic opportunity
297.303	to study them, to get access to them.
300.783	What we've been doing for a couple
300.783	years -- last year was a big year --
304.205	is we started tagging sharks,
306.083	so we could try to get some idea
306.083	of sight fidelity and movement
309.153	and things like that.
310.335	So we concentrated mainly
310.335	in North Donegal and West Kerry
313.66	as the two areas
313.66	where I was mainly active.
316.395	And we tagged them
316.395	very simply, not very high-tech,
320.576	with a big, long pole.
321.776	This is a beachcaster rod
321.776	with a tag on the end.
324.426	You go up in your boat and tag the shark.
327.859	And we were very effective.
329.431	We tagged 105 sharks last summer.
332.293	We got 50 in three days
332.293	off Inishowen Peninsula.
335.968	Half the challenge to get access
337.549	is to be in the right place
337.549	at the right time.
339.787	But it's a very simple, easy technique;
339.787	I'll show you what it looks like.
343.28	We use a pole camera on the boat
343.28	to actually film the shark.
346.155	One, it's to try and work out
346.155	the gender of the shark.
348.716	We also deployed some satellite tags,
348.716	so we did use high-tech stuff as well.
352.403	These are archival tags.
353.736	What they do is store the data.
355.699	A satellite tag only works
355.699	when the air is clear of the water
358.609	and can send a signal to the satellite.
360.53	And sharks and fish
360.53	are underwater most of the time,
363.009	so this tag actually works out
363.009	the locations of shark,
365.962	depending on the timing
365.962	and the setting of the sun,
369.348	plus water temperature and depth.
371.323	And you have to kind of
371.323	reconstruct the path.
373.515	What happens is,
374.712	you set the tag to detach
374.712	from the shark after a fixed period --
377.826	in this case, eight months --
379.248	and literally to the day,
379.248	the tag popped off,
381.38	drifted up, said hello to the satellite
383.283	and sent, not all the data,
383.283	but enough data for us to use.
386.176	This is the only way to really work out
386.176	their behavior and movements
389.444	when they're underwater.
391.537	And here's a couple
391.537	of maps that we've done.
393.66	In that one, you can see
393.66	that we tagged both off Kerry.
396.84	Basically, it spent all its time,
396.84	the last eight months, in Irish waters.
400.349	On Christmas, it was out
400.349	on the shelf edge.
402.382	Here's one we haven't ground-truthed yet
404.35	with sea-surface temperature
404.35	and water depth,
406.499	but again, the second shark
406.499	spent most of its time
408.876	in and around the Irish Sea.
410.249	Colleagues from the Isle of Man
410.249	last year actually tagged one shark
413.451	that went from the Isle of Man
413.451	to Nova Scotia in about 90 days.
416.659	Nine and a half thousand kilometers --
416.659	we never thought that happened.
420.006	Another colleague in the States
420.006	tagged about 20 sharks off Massachusetts.
423.954	His tags didn't really work.
425.418	All he knows is where he tagged them,
427.275	and where they popped off.
428.767	His tags popped off in the Caribbean,
431.109	and even in Brazil.
432.66	We thought basking sharks
432.66	were temperate animals
434.999	and lived in our latitudes,
436.515	but in actual fact, they're obviously
436.515	crossing the equator as well.
439.731	So very simple things like that,
441.517	we're trying to learn
441.517	about basking sharks.
444.348	One thing that I think
444.348	is a very surprising and strange thing
448.945	is just how low the genetic
448.945	diversity of sharks is.
451.934	I'm not a geneticist, so I won't pretend
451.934	to understand the genetics.
455.419	And that's why it's great
455.419	to have collaboration.
457.8	Whereas I'm a field person,
459.136	I get panic attacks
460.684	if I have to spend too many hours
460.684	in a lab with a white coat on.
463.856	Take me away.
465.111	So we can work with geneticists
465.111	who understand that.
467.715	So when they looked at
467.715	the genetics of basking sharks,
470.319	they found that the diversity
470.319	was incredibly low.
473.352	If you look at the first line, really,
475.235	you can see that all these different
475.235	shark species are all quite similar.
478.715	I think this means they're all sharks
480.517	and they've come from a common ancestry.
482.471	But if you look at nucleotide diversity,
484.565	which is more genetics
484.565	that are passed on through the parents,
487.809	you see that basking sharks,
487.809	if you look at the first study,
490.666	was order of magnitude less diverse
490.666	even than other shark species.
494.66	You can see this work
494.66	was only done in 2006.
496.756	Before 2006, we had no idea of the genetic
496.756	variability of basking sharks.
500.417	We had no idea: Did they distinguish
500.417	into different populations?
503.554	Were there subpopulations?
504.853	And that's very important
504.853	if you want to know
507.028	what the population size is,
507.028	and the status of the animals.
509.829	So, Les Noble in Aberdeen kind of found
509.829	this a bit unbelievable, really.
513.464	So he did another study
513.464	using microsatellites,
520.073	which is much more expensive,
520.073	much more time-consuming,
522.708	and to his surprise,
522.708	came up with almost identical results.
525.993	So it does seem to be
525.993	that basking sharks, for some reason,
528.929	have incredibly low diversity.
530.723	And it's thought maybe
530.723	it was a genetic bottleneck,
533.241	thought to have been 12,000 years ago,
535.336	and this has caused a very low diversity.
537.884	And yet, if you look at the whale shark,
539.868	which is the other
539.868	plankton-eating large shark,
542.607	its diversity is much greater.
544.102	So it doesn't really make sense at all.
546.561	They found that there was
546.561	no genetic differentiation
549.019	between any of the world's oceans
549.019	of basking sharks:
551.504	even though they're found
551.504	throughout the world,
553.766	you couldn't tell
553.766	the difference, genetically,
555.948	from one from the Pacific, Atlantic,
555.948	New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa.
559.405	They all basically seem the same.
561.008	Which, again, is kind of surprising;
561.008	you wouldn't expect that.
563.937	I don't understand or pretend
563.937	to understand this;
566.308	I suspect most geneticists don't either,
568.242	but they produce the numbers.
569.66	So you can actually estimate
569.66	the population size
572.011	based on the diversity of the genetics.
574.205	And Rus Hoelzel came up with
574.205	an effective population size:
577.781	8,200 animals.
579.638	That's it -- 8,000 animals in the world.
582.566	You're thinking,
582.566	"""That's ridiculous. No way."""
584.812	So Les did a finer study,
586.66	and he found out it came out about 9,000.
589.462	Using different microsatellites
589.462	gave the different results,
592.367	but the mean of all these
592.367	studies is about 5,000,
597.032	which I personally don't believe.
598.66	But then, I am a skeptic.
600.314	But even if you toss a few numbers around,
602.767	you're probably talking an effective
602.767	population of about 20,000 animals.
606.208	Do you remember how many they killed
606.208	off Achill in the 70s and the 50s?
610.747	So what it tells us, actually,
612.467	is that there's actually a risk
612.467	of extinction of this species
615.743	because its population is so small.
617.66	In fact, of those 20,000,
619.215	8,000 were thought to be females.
621.407	There's only 8,000 basking shark
621.407	females in the world?
624.118	I don't know. I don't believe it.
626.385	The problem with this
626.385	is they were constrained with samples.
630.052	They didn't get enough samples
631.659	to really explore the genetics
631.659	in enough detail.
635.974	So, where do you get samples from
635.974	for your genetic analysis?
640.93	Well, one obvious source is dead sharks --
643.742	dead sharks, washed up.
645.018	We might get two or three dead sharks
645.018	washed up in Ireland a year,
648.298	if we're kind of lucky.
649.844	Another source would be
649.844	fisheries' bycatch.
652.218	We were getting quite a few caught
652.218	in surface drift nets.
655.231	That's banned now, and that'll be
655.231	good news for the sharks.
658.041	And some are caught in nets, in trawls.
659.982	This is a shark that was actually
659.982	landed in Howth just before Christmas --
663.624	illegally, because you're not allowed
663.624	to do that under EU law --
666.675	and was actually sold
666.675	for eight euros a kilo as shark steak.
669.537	They even put a recipe up on the wall,
671.385	until they were told it was illegal.
673.187	They actually did get a fine for that.
675.09	So if you look at
675.09	all those studies I showed you,
677.44	the total number of samples worldwide
680.12	is 86, at present.
682.118	So it's very important work,
684.234	and they can ask
684.234	some really good questions,
686.353	and tell us about population size
686.353	and subpopulations and structure,
690.66	but they're constrained
690.66	by lack of samples.
694.004	When we were out tagging our sharks --
695.877	this is how we tagged them on the front
695.877	of a RIB, get in there fast --
699.211	occasionally, the sharks do react.
701.401	On one occasion, when we were
701.401	up in Malin Head in Donegal,
704.176	the shark smacked the side
704.176	of the boat with his tail,
706.698	more, I think, in startle to the fact
706.698	that a boat came near it,
709.866	rather than the tag going in.
712.217	And that was fine. We got wet. No problem.
715.136	And then when myself and Emmett
715.136	got back to Malin Head, to the pier,
719.15	I noticed some black slime
719.15	on the front of the boat.
721.616	I used to spend a lot of time
721.616	on commercial fishing boats,
724.369	and I remember fishermen saying
725.872	they can tell when a basking shark
725.872	has been caught in a net,
728.719	because it leaves a black slime behind.
730.623	So that must have come from the shark.
732.478	Now, we had an interest
732.478	in getting tissue samples for genetics
735.896	because we knew they were very valuable.
737.906	We would use conventional methods;
739.587	I have a crossbow --
739.587	you see it in my hand there,
741.928	which we use to sample whales
741.928	and dolphins for genetic studies as well.
745.438	So I tried that, I tried many techniques.
747.437	All it was doing was breaking my arrows,
749.39	because the shark's skin
749.39	is just so strong.
751.439	There was no way we were going
751.439	to get a sample from that.
754.239	That wasn't going to work.
755.84	So when I saw the black slime
755.84	on the bow of the boat,
758.421	"I thought, ""If you take"
758.421	"what you're given in this world ..."""
761.422	So I scraped it off.
762.61	I had a little tube with alcohol in it
762.61	to send to the geneticists.
767.029	So I scraped the slime off
767.029	and sent it to Aberdeen,
770.108	"and said, ""You might try that."""
771.648	And they sat on it for months.
773.282	It was only because we had
773.282	a conference on the Isle of Man.
776.118	But I kept emailing Les, saying,
777.681	"""Have you had a chance"
777.681	"to look at my slime?"""
779.8	"And he was like, ""Yeah, yeah. Later."""
781.667	He thought he'd better do it
781.667	because I never met him before;
784.514	he might lose face if he hadn't done
784.514	the thing I sent him.
787.293	And he was amazed that they actually
787.293	got DNA from the slime.
790.168	They amplified it and they tested it,
792.027	and they found, yes,
792.027	this was actually basking shark DNA,
794.849	which was got from the slime.
797.828	So he was very excited.
799.017	"It became known as ""Simon's shark slime."""
802.326	"And I thought, ""Hey, you know,"
802.326	"I can build on this."""
805.241	So we thought, OK, we're going to try
805.241	to get out and get some slime.
809.027	So having spent three-and-a-half
809.027	thousand on satellite tags ...
815.247	I then thought I'd invest 7.95 --
815.247	the price is still on it --
818.708	in my local hardware store in Kilrush
820.922	for a mop handle,
822.716	and even less money on some oven cleaners.
825.66	And I wrapped the oven cleaner
825.66	around the edge of the mop handle
829.155	and ...
830.66	(Laughter)
832.242	I was desperate to have an opportunity
832.242	to get some sharks.
835.797	And this was into August now,
835.797	and normally sharks peak in June, July,
840.214	and you rarely see them,
840.214	or rarely can be in the right place
843.227	to find sharks into August.
844.802	We were desperate,
844.802	so we rushed out to the Blaskets
847.256	as soon as we heard
847.256	there were sharks there,
849.35	and managed to find some sharks.
850.901	So by just rubbing
850.901	the mop handle down the shark
854.389	as it swam under the boat --
855.981	you see a shark
855.981	running under the boat here --
858.515	we managed to collect slime.
859.881	And here it is.
861.153	Look at that lovely black shark slime.
864.906	And in about half an hour,
864.906	we got five samples.
869.523	Five individual sharks were sampled
871.3	using Simon's Shark Slime Sampling System.
874.156	(Laughter)
875.995	(Applause)
881.35	I've been working on whales and dolphins
881.35	in Ireland for 20 years now,
884.628	and they're a bit more dramatic.
886.191	You probably saw
886.191	the humpback whale footage
888.251	we got a month or two ago
888.251	off County Wexford.
890.385	And you always think
890.385	you might have some legacy
892.659	you can leave the world behind,
894.177	and I was thinking of humpback
894.177	whales breaching and dolphins.
897.136	But hey -- sometimes
897.136	these things are sent to you
899.545	and you just have to take them
899.545	when they come.
901.761	So this is possibly
901.761	going to be my legacy --
903.882	Simon's Shark Slime.
905.548	We got more money this year
907.206	to carry on collecting
907.206	more and more samples.
909.851	One thing that is very useful
909.851	is that we use a pole camera --
912.815	this is my colleague, Joanne,
912.815	with a pole camera --
915.252	where you can look underneath the shark.
917.215	What you're trying to look at is,
917.215	the males have claspers,
920.008	which kind of dangle out
920.008	behind the back of the shark.
922.652	So you can quite easily tell
922.652	the gender of the shark.
925.273	If we can tell the gender of the shark
925.273	before we sample it,
929.044	we can tell the geneticist
929.044	this was taken from a male or a female.
932.175	Because in the moment,
932.175	they have no way, genetically,
934.702	of telling the difference
934.702	between a male and a female,
937.264	which I find staggering,
938.447	because they don't know
938.447	what primers to look for.
941.056	Being able to tell the gender of a shark
943.394	is very important
943.394	for things like policing the trade
947.66	in basking shark and other species
947.66	through the sightings,
952.08	because it is illegal
952.08	to trade in these sharks.
954.319	And they are caught and are on the market.
956.381	So as a field biologist,
957.776	you just want to get encounters
957.776	with these animals,
960.246	and learn as much as you can.
961.66	They're often quite brief,
961.66	they're often very seasonally constrained.
965.094	You just want to learn as much
965.094	as you can as soon as you can.
968.023	But isn't it fantastic
969.814	that you can then offer
969.814	these samples and opportunities
973.337	to other disciplines,
973.337	such as the geneticists,
976.181	who can gain so much more from that.
978.66	So as I said, these things
978.66	are sent to you in strange ways.
982.39	Grab them while you can.
983.66	I'll take that as my scientific legacy.
985.626	Hopefully, I might get something
985.626	a bit more dramatic and romantic
988.737	before I die.
990.01	But for the time being,
990.01	thank you for that.
992.439	And keep an eye out for sharks.
993.949	If you're more interested, we have
993.949	a basking shark website now set up.
997.719	So thank you and thank you for listening.
999.713	(Applause)
