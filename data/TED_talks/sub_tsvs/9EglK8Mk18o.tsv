12.536	So I'll be talking about the success of my campus,
16.598	the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC,
19.348	in educating students of all types,
22.539	across the arts and humanities and the science and engineering areas.
26.666	What makes our story especially important
30.744	is that we have learned so much from a group of students
35.952	who are typically not at the top of the academic ladder --
39.299	students of color, students underrepresented in selected areas.
43.297	And what makes the story especially unique
46.148	is that we have learned how to help African-American students, Latino students,
50.982	students from low-income backgrounds,
52.786	to become some of the best in the world in science and engineering.
56.244	And so I begin with a story about my childhood.
59.714	We all are products of our childhood experiences.
62.786	It's hard for me to believe that it's been 50 years
66.964	since I had the experience of being a ninth grade kid in Birmingham, Alabama,
72.87	a kid who loved getting A's,
75.037	a kid who loved math, who loved to read,
77.724	a kid who would say to the teacher --
80.453	"when the teacher said, ""Here are 10 problems,"" to the class,"
83.709	"this little fat kid would say, ""Give us 10 more."""
87.79	"And the whole class would say, ""Shut up, Freeman."""
91.102	And there was a designated kicker every day.
94.716	And so I was always asking this question:
96.597	"""Well how could we get more kids to really love to learn?"""
102.554	And amazingly, one week in church,
105.672	when I really didn't want to be there
107.754	and I was in the back of the room being placated by doing math problems,
112.855	I heard this man say this:
115.291	"""If we can get the children"
117.773	to participate in this peaceful demonstration here in Birmingham,
123.77	we can show America that even children know the difference between right and wrong
129.171	"and that children really do want to get the best possible education."""
133.904	"And I looked up and said, ""Who is that man?"""
135.625	And they said his name was Dr. Martin Luther King.
138.754	"And I said to my parents, ""I've got to go."
140.685	"I want to go. I want to be a part of this."""
142.254	"And they said, ""Absolutely not."""
144.124	(Laughter)
145.337	And we had a rough go of it.
147.255	And at that time, quite frankly, you really did not talk back to your parents.
150.708	"And somehow I said, ""You know, you guys are hypocrites."
152.995	You make me go to this. You make me listen.
154.972	"The man wants me to go, and now you say no."""
157.206	And they thought about it all night.
158.954	And they came into my room the next morning.
161.088	They had not slept.
162.588	They had been literally crying and praying and thinking,
165.104	"""Will we let our 12-year-old"
168.664	"participate in this march and probably have to go to jail?"""
172.816	And they decided to do it.
174.505	And when they came in to tell me,
175.887	I was at first elated.
177.672	And then all of a sudden I began thinking about the dogs and the fire hoses,
181.604	and I got really scared, I really did.
184.486	And one of the points I make to people all the time
186.588	is that sometimes when people do things that are courageous,
189.823	it doesn't really mean that they're that courageous.
192.172	It simply means that they believe it's important to do it.
195.02	I wanted a better education.
196.771	I did not want to have to have hand-me-down books.
200.004	I wanted to know that the school I attended
202.487	not only had good teachers, but the resources we needed.
204.912	And as a result of that experience,
206.588	in the middle of the week, while I was there in jail,
208.922	Dr. King came and said with our parents,
211.472	"""What you children do this day"
214.437	"will have an impact on children who have not been born."""
219.021	I recently realized that two-thirds of Americans today
223.956	had not been born at the time of 1963.
227.47	And so for them, when they hear about the Children's Crusade in Birmingham,
230.411	in many ways, if they see it on TV,
232.673	"it's like our looking at the 1863 ""Lincoln"" movie:"
236.087	It's history.
237.521	And the real question is, what lessons did we learn?
240.494	Well amazingly, the most important for me was this:
243.386	That children can be empowered to take ownership of their education.
248.686	They can be taught to be passionate
251.037	about wanting to learn and to love the idea of asking questions.
255.578	And so it is especially significant
258.373	that the university I now lead,
260.459	the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC,
263.254	was founded the very year I went to jail with Dr. King, in 1963.
269.04	And what made that institutional founding especially important
273.21	is that Maryland is the South, as you know,
277.744	and, quite frankly, it was the first university in our state
282.326	founded at a time when students of all races could go there.
286.402	And so we had black and white students and others who began to attend.
289.975	And it has been for 50 years an experiment.
294.16	The experiment is this:
295.86	Is it possible to have institutions in our country, universities,
299.819	where people from all backgrounds can come and learn
302.756	and learn to work together and learn to become leaders
306.339	and to support each other in that experience?
309.912	Now what is especially important about that experience for me is this:
314.827	We found that we could do a lot in the arts and humanities and social sciences.
319.495	And so we began to work on that, for years in the '60s.
322.051	And we produced a number of people in law, all the way to the humanities.
325.834	We produced great artists. Beckett is our muse.
328.467	A lot of our students get into theater.
330.004	It's great work.
331.004	The problem that we faced was the same problem America continues to face --
335.036	that students in the sciences and engineering,
336.883	black students were not succeeding.
338.994	But when I looked at the data,
340.745	what I found was that, quite frankly, students in general,
344.077	large numbers were not making it.
345.7	And as a result of that,
347.618	we decided to do something that would help, first of all,
350.952	the group at the bottom, African-American students, and then Hispanic students.
355.169	"And Robert and Jane Meyerhoff, philanthropists, said, ""We'd like to help."""
359.5	"Robert Meyerhoff said, ""Why is it that everything I see on TV about black boys,"
362.953	if it's not about basketball, is not positive?
365.751	"I'd like to make a difference, to do something that's positive."""
368.383	We married those ideas, and we created this Meyerhoff Scholars program.
372.05	And what is significant about the program
374.119	is that we learned a number of things.
376.6	And the question is this:
377.952	How is it that now we lead the country in producing African-Americans
382.417	who go on to complete Ph.D.'s in science and engineering and M.D./Ph.D.'s?
387.267	That's a big deal. Give me a hand for that. That's a big deal.
389.916	That's a big deal. It really is.
392.151	(Applause)
394.727	You see, most people don't realize
396.671	that it's not just minorities who don't do well in science and engineering.
400.721	Quite frankly, you're talking about Americans.
404.338	If you don't know it, while 20 percent of blacks and Hispanics
407.786	who begin with a major in science and engineering
410.121	will actually graduate in science and engineering,
412.273	only 32 percent of whites who begin with majors in those areas
415.827	actually succeed and graduate in those areas,
418.485	and only 42 percent of Asian-Americans.
420.59	And so, the real question is, what is the challenge?
423.201	Well a part of it, of course, is K-12.
425.588	We need to strengthen K-12.
427.537	But the other part has to do with the culture
429.833	of science and engineering on our campuses.
432.493	Whether you know it or not, large numbers of students with high SAT's
436.338	and large numbers of A.P. credits
437.803	who go to the most prestigious universities in our country
440.505	begin in pre-med or pre-engineering and engineering, and they end up changing their majors.
445.336	And the number one reason, we find, quite frankly,
447.802	is they did not do well in first year science courses.
450.752	In fact, we call first year science and engineering, typically around America,
454.535	weed-out courses or barrier courses.
456.669	How many of you in this audience know somebody
458.437	who started off in pre-med or engineering
460.252	and changed their major within a year or two?
462.137	It's an American challenge. Half of you in the room.
463.935	I know. I know. I know.
465.336	And what is interesting about that
466.994	is that so many students are smart and can do it.
469.704	We need to find ways of making it happen.
471.97	So what are the four things we did to help minority students
474.577	that now are helping students in general?
476.386	Number one: high expectations.
478.253	It takes an understanding of the academic preparation of students --
482.758	their grades, the rigor of the course work,
485.102	their test-taking skills, their attitude,
487.553	the fire in their belly, the passion for the work, to make it.
490.278	And so doing things to help students prepare to be in that position, very important.
494.519	But equally important, it takes an understanding that it's hard work that makes the difference.
499.618	I don't care how smart you are or how smart you think you are.
502.136	Smart simply means you're ready to learn.
504.503	You're excited about learning and you want to ask good questions.
507.745	I. I. Rabi, a Nobel laureate, said that when he was growing up in New York,
512.032	all of his friends' parents would ask them
514.578	"""What did you learn in school?"" at the end of a day."
517.22	And he said, in contrast, his Jewish mother would say,
520.757	"""Izzy, did you ask a good question today?"""
523.819	And so high expectations have to do with curiosity
526.518	and encouraging young people to be curious.
529.036	And as a result of those high expectations,
530.552	we began to find students we wanted to work with
533.219	to see what could we do to help them,
534.912	not simply to survive in science and engineering,
537.452	but to become the very best, to excel.
540.386	Interestingly enough, an example:
542.203	One young man who earned a C in the first course and wanted to go on to med school,
547.105	"we said, ""We need to have you retake the course,"
549.22	"because you need a strong foundation if you're going to move to the next level."""
553.004	Every foundation makes the difference in the next level.
556.035	He retook the course.
557.176	That young man went on to graduate from UMBC,
559.605	to become the first black to get the M.D./Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania.
563.802	He now works at Harvard.
565.008	Nice story. Give him a hand for that too.
567.455	(Applause)
569.886	Secondly, it's not about test scores only.
572.381	Test scores are important, but they're not the most important thing.
574.37	One young woman had great grades, but test scores were not as high.
577.415	But she had a factor that was very important.
579.464	She never missed a day of school, K-12.
582.712	There was fire in that belly.
584.133	That young woman went on, and she is today with an M.D./Ph.D. from Hopkins.
588.257	She's on the faculty, tenure track in psychiatry, Ph.D. in neuroscience.
592.475	She and her adviser have a patent on a second use of Viagra for diabetes patients.
597.286	Big hand for her. Big hand for her.
599.771	(Applause)
601.157	And so high expectations, very important.
603.677	Secondly, the idea of building community among the students.
606.536	You all know that so often in science and engineering
609.303	we tend to think cutthroat.
610.994	Students are not taught to work in groups.
613.31	And that's what we work to do with that group
615.202	to get them to understand each other,
616.705	to build trust among them, to support each other,
619.328	to learn how to ask good questions,
621.037	but also to learn how to explain concepts with clarity.
624.524	As you know, it's one thing to earn an A yourself,
626.787	it's another thing to help someone else do well.
628.912	And so to feel that sense of responsibility makes all the difference in the world.
632.827	So building community among those students, very important.
635.774	Third, the idea of, it takes researchers to produce researchers.
640.578	Whether you're talking about artists producing artists
643.107	or you're talking about people getting into the social sciences,
646.022	whatever the discipline -- and especially in science and engineering, as in art, for example --
650.869	you need scientists to pull the students into the work.
653.672	And so our students are working in labs regularly.
656.412	And one great example that you'll appreciate:
658.786	During a snowstorm in Baltimore several years ago,
661.846	the guy on our campus with this Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant
665.466	literally came back to work in his lab after several days,
669.89	and all these students had refused to leave the lab.
673.183	They had food they had packed out.
675.267	They were in the lab working,
676.582	and they saw the work, not as schoolwork, but as their lives.
680.583	They knew they were working on AIDS research.
682.495	They were looking at this amazing protein design.
685.703	And what was interesting was each one of them focused on that work.
690.036	"And he said, ""It doesn't get any better than that."""
692.202	And then finally, if you've got the community
694.287	and you've got the high expectations and you've got researchers producing researchers,
697.9	you have to have people who are willing as faculty
700.788	to get involved with those students, even in the classroom.
703.851	I'll never forget a faculty member calling the staff and saying,
706.299	"""I've got this young man in class, a young black guy,"
708.744	and he seems like he's just not excited about the work.
711.784	"He's not taking notes. We need to talk to him."""
714.019	What was significant was that the faculty member was observing every student
717.891	to understand who was really involved and who was not
720.807	"and was saying, ""Let me see how I can work with them."
723.174	"Let me get the staff to help me out."""
724.411	It was that connecting.
725.563	That young man today is actually a faculty member M.D./Ph.D. in neuroengineering at Duke.
730.495	Give him a big hand for that.
731.707	(Applause)
733.703	And so the significance is that we have now developed this model
738.523	that is helping us, not only finally with evaluation, assessing what works.
742.688	And what we learned was that we needed to think about redesigning courses.
746.12	And so we redesigned chemistry, we redesigned physics.
748.661	But now we are looking at redesigning the humanities and social sciences.
752.322	Because so many students are bored in class.
754.869	Do you know that?
756.049	Many students, K-12 and in universities,
757.995	don't want to just sit there and listen to somebody talk.
760.5	They need to be engaged.
761.87	And so we have done -- if you look at our website at the Chemistry Discovery Center,
765.32	you'll see people coming from all over the country
767.285	to look at how we are redesigning courses,
769.864	having an emphasis on collaboration, use of technology,
773.355	using problems out of our biotech companies on our campus,
776.585	and not giving students the theories,
778.615	but having them struggle with those theories.
780.847	And it's working so well that throughout our university system in Maryland,
784.506	more and more courses are being redesigned.
786.547	It's called academic innovation.
788.381	And what does all of that mean?
789.586	It means that now, not just in science and engineering,
792.429	we now have programs in the arts, in the humanities, in the social sciences,
796.537	in teacher education, even particularly for women in I.T.
801.129	If you don't know it, there's been a 79-percent decline
805.216	in the number of women majoring in computer science just since 2000.
809.334	And what I'm saying is that what will make the difference
812.647	will be building community among students,
815.202	telling young women, young minority students and students in general,
818.198	you can do this work.
819.447	And most important, giving them a chance to build that community
822.717	with faculty pulling them into the work
824.88	and our assessing what works and what does not work.
827.398	Most important, if a student has a sense of self,
831.246	it is amazing how the dreams and the values
834.13	can make all the difference in the world.
836.119	When I was a 12-year-old child in the jail in Birmingham,
839.749	"I kept thinking, ""I wonder what my future could be."""
843.013	I had no idea that it was possible for this little black boy in Birmingham
848.798	to one day be president of a university that has students from 150 countries,
853.763	where students are not there just to survive,
856.119	where they love learning, where they enjoy being the best,
860.12	where they will one day change the world.
862.661	"Aristotle said, ""Excellence is never an accident."
866.036	It is the result of high intention, sincere effort and intelligent execution.
872.031	"It represents the wisest option among many alternatives."""
875.963	And then he said something that gives me goosebumps.
878.297	"He said, ""Choice, not chance, determines your destiny."""
883.944	Choice, not chance, determines your destiny, dreams and values.
891.506	Thank you all very much.
893.44	(Applause)
