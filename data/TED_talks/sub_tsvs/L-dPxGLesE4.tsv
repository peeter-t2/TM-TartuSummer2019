15.26	For the last 10 years, I've been spending my time trying to figure out
18.26	how and why human beings
20.26	assemble themselves into social networks.
23.26	And the kind of social network I'm talking about
25.26	is not the recent online variety,
27.26	but rather, the kind of social networks
29.26	that human beings have been assembling for hundreds of thousands of years,
32.26	ever since we emerged from the African savannah.
35.26	So, I form friendships and co-worker
37.26	and sibling and relative relationships with other people
40.26	who in turn have similar relationships with other people.
42.26	And this spreads on out endlessly into a distance.
45.26	And you get a network that looks like this.
47.26	Every dot is a person.
49.26	Every line between them is a relationship between two people --
51.26	different kinds of relationships.
53.26	And you can get this kind of vast fabric of humanity,
56.26	in which we're all embedded.
58.26	And my colleague, James Fowler and I have been studying for quite sometime
61.26	what are the mathematical, social,
63.26	biological and psychological rules
66.26	that govern how these networks are assembled
68.26	and what are the similar rules
70.26	that govern how they operate, how they affect our lives.
73.26	But recently, we've been wondering
75.26	whether it might be possible to take advantage of this insight,
78.26	to actually find ways to improve the world,
80.26	to do something better,
82.26	to actually fix things, not just understand things.
85.26	So one of the first things we thought we would tackle
88.26	would be how we go about predicting epidemics.
91.26	And the current state of the art in predicting an epidemic --
93.26	if you're the CDC or some other national body --
96.26	is to sit in the middle where you are
98.26	and collect data
100.26	from physicians and laboratories in the field
102.26	that report the prevalence or the incidence of certain conditions.
105.26	So, so and so patients have been diagnosed with something,
108.26	or other patients have been diagnosed,
110.26	and all these data are fed into a central repository, with some delay.
113.26	And if everything goes smoothly,
115.26	one to two weeks from now
117.26	you'll know where the epidemic was today.
120.26	And actually, about a year or so ago,
122.26	there was this promulgation
124.26	of the idea of Google Flu Trends, with respect to the flu,
127.26	where by looking at people's searching behavior today,
130.26	we could know where the flu --
132.26	what the status of the epidemic was today,
134.26	what's the prevalence of the epidemic today.
137.26	But what I'd like to show you today
139.26	is a means by which we might get
141.26	not just rapid warning about an epidemic,
144.26	but also actually
146.26	early detection of an epidemic.
148.26	And, in fact, this idea can be used
150.26	not just to predict epidemics of germs,
153.26	but also to predict epidemics of all sorts of kinds.
157.26	For example, anything that spreads by a form of social contagion
160.26	could be understood in this way,
162.26	from abstract ideas on the left
164.26	like patriotism, or altruism, or religion
167.26	to practices
169.26	like dieting behavior, or book purchasing,
171.26	or drinking, or bicycle-helmet [and] other safety practices,
174.26	or products that people might buy,
176.26	purchases of electronic goods,
178.26	anything in which there's kind of an interpersonal spread.
181.26	A kind of a diffusion of innovation
183.26	could be understood and predicted
185.26	by the mechanism I'm going to show you now.
188.26	So, as all of you probably know,
190.26	the classic way of thinking about this
192.26	is the diffusion-of-innovation,
194.26	or the adoption curve.
196.26	So here on the Y-axis, we have the percent of the people affected,
198.26	and on the X-axis, we have time.
200.26	And at the very beginning, not too many people are affected,
203.26	and you get this classic sigmoidal,
205.26	or S-shaped, curve.
207.26	And the reason for this shape is that at the very beginning,
209.26	let's say one or two people
211.26	are infected, or affected by the thing
213.26	and then they affect, or infect, two people,
215.26	who in turn affect four, eight, 16 and so forth,
218.26	and you get the epidemic growth phase of the curve.
221.26	And eventually, you saturate the population.
223.26	There are fewer and fewer people
225.26	who are still available that you might infect,
227.26	and then you get the plateau of the curve,
229.26	and you get this classic sigmoidal curve.
232.26	And this holds for germs, ideas,
234.26	product adoption, behaviors,
236.26	and the like.
238.26	But things don't just diffuse in human populations at random.
241.26	They actually diffuse through networks.
243.26	Because, as I said, we live our lives in networks,
246.26	and these networks have a particular kind of a structure.
249.26	Now if you look at a network like this --
251.26	this is 105 people.
253.26	And the lines represent -- the dots are the people,
255.26	and the lines represent friendship relationships.
257.26	You might see that people occupy
259.26	different locations within the network.
261.26	And there are different kinds of relationships between the people.
263.26	You could have friendship relationships, sibling relationships,
266.26	spousal relationships, co-worker relationships,
269.26	neighbor relationships and the like.
272.26	And different sorts of things
274.26	spread across different sorts of ties.
276.26	For instance, sexually transmitted diseases
278.26	will spread across sexual ties.
280.26	Or, for instance, people's smoking behavior
282.26	might be influenced by their friends.
284.26	Or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior
286.26	might be influenced by their coworkers,
288.26	or by their neighbors.
290.26	But not all positions in the network are the same.
293.26	So if you look at this, you might immediately grasp
295.26	that different people have different numbers of connections.
298.26	Some people have one connection, some have two,
300.26	some have six, some have 10 connections.
303.26	"And this is called the ""degree"" of a node,"
305.26	or the number of connections that a node has.
307.26	But in addition, there's something else.
309.26	So, if you look at nodes A and B,
311.26	they both have six connections.
313.26	But if you can see this image [of the network] from a bird's eye view,
316.26	you can appreciate that there's something very different
318.26	about nodes A and B.
320.26	So, let me ask you this -- I can cultivate this intuition by asking a question --
323.26	who would you rather be
325.26	if a deadly germ was spreading through the network, A or B?
328.26	(Audience: B.) Nicholas Christakis: B, it's obvious.
330.26	B is located on the edge of the network.
332.26	Now, who would you rather be
334.26	if a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network?
337.26	A. And you have an immediate appreciation
340.26	that A is going to be more likely
342.26	to get the thing that's spreading and to get it sooner
345.26	by virtue of their structural location within the network.
348.26	A, in fact, is more central,
350.26	and this can be formalized mathematically.
353.26	So, if we want to track something
355.26	that was spreading through a network,
358.26	what we ideally would like to do is to set up sensors
360.26	on the central individuals within the network,
362.26	including node A,
364.26	monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network,
367.26	and somehow get an early detection
369.26	of whatever it is that is spreading through the network.
372.26	So if you saw them contract a germ or a piece of information,
375.26	you would know that, soon enough,
377.26	everybody was about to contract this germ
379.26	or this piece of information.
381.26	And this would be much better
383.26	than monitoring six randomly chosen people,
385.26	without reference to the structure of the population.
388.26	And in fact, if you could do that,
390.26	what you would see is something like this.
392.26	On the left-hand panel, again, we have the S-shaped curve of adoption.
395.26	In the dotted red line, we show
397.26	what the adoption would be in the random people,
399.26	and in the left-hand line, shifted to the left,
402.26	we show what the adoption would be
404.26	in the central individuals within the network.
406.26	On the Y-axis is the cumulative instances of contagion,
408.26	and on the X-axis is the time.
410.26	And on the right-hand side, we show the same data,
412.26	but here with daily incidence.
414.26	And what we show here is -- like, here --
416.26	very few people are affected, more and more and more and up to here,
418.26	and here's the peak of the epidemic.
420.26	But shifted to the left is what's occurring in the central individuals.
422.26	And this difference in time between the two
425.26	is the early detection, the early warning we can get,
428.26	about an impending epidemic
430.26	in the human population.
432.26	The problem, however,
434.26	is that mapping human social networks
436.26	is not always possible.
438.26	It can be expensive, not feasible,
440.26	unethical,
442.26	or, frankly, just not possible to do such a thing.
445.26	So, how can we figure out
447.26	who the central people are in a network
449.26	without actually mapping the network?
452.26	What we came up with
454.26	was an idea to exploit an old fact,
456.26	or a known fact, about social networks,
458.26	which goes like this:
460.26	Do you know that your friends
462.26	have more friends than you do?
465.26	Your friends have more friends than you do,
468.26	and this is known as the friendship paradox.
470.26	Imagine a very popular person in the social network --
472.26	like a party host who has hundreds of friends --
475.26	and a misanthrope who has just one friend,
477.26	and you pick someone at random from the population;
480.26	they were much more likely to know the party host.
482.26	And if they nominate the party host as their friend,
484.26	that party host has a hundred friends,
486.26	therefore, has more friends than they do.
489.26	And this, in essence, is what's known as the friendship paradox.
492.26	The friends of randomly chosen people
495.26	have higher degree, and are more central
497.26	than the random people themselves.
499.26	And you can get an intuitive appreciation for this
501.26	if you imagine just the people at the perimeter of the network.
504.26	If you pick this person,
506.26	the only friend they have to nominate is this person,
509.26	who, by construction, must have at least two
511.26	and typically more friends.
513.26	And that happens at every peripheral node.
515.26	And in fact, it happens throughout the network as you move in,
518.26	everyone you pick, when they nominate a random --
520.26	when a random person nominates a friend of theirs,
523.26	you move closer to the center of the network.
526.26	So, we thought we would exploit this idea
529.26	in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks.
532.26	Because now, with this idea
534.26	we can take a random sample of people,
536.26	have them nominate their friends,
538.26	those friends would be more central,
540.26	and we could do this without having to map the network.
543.26	And we tested this idea with an outbreak of H1N1 flu
546.26	at Harvard College
548.26	in the fall and winter of 2009, just a few months ago.
551.26	We took 1,300 randomly selected undergraduates,
554.26	we had them nominate their friends,
556.26	and we followed both the random students and their friends
558.26	daily in time
560.26	to see whether or not they had the flu epidemic.
563.26	And we did this passively by looking at whether or not they'd gone to university health services.
566.26	And also, we had them [actively] email us a couple of times a week.
569.26	Exactly what we predicted happened.
572.26	So the random group is in the red line.
575.26	The epidemic in the friends group has shifted to the left, over here.
578.26	And the difference in the two is 16 days.
581.26	By monitoring the friends group,
583.26	we could get 16 days advance warning
585.26	of an impending epidemic in this human population.
588.26	Now, in addition to that,
590.26	if you were an analyst who was trying to study an epidemic
593.26	or to predict the adoption of a product, for example,
596.26	what you could do is you could pick a random sample of the population,
599.26	also have them nominate their friends and follow the friends
602.26	and follow both the randoms and the friends.
605.26	Among the friends, the first evidence you saw of a blip above zero
608.26	in adoption of the innovation, for example,
611.26	would be evidence of an impending epidemic.
613.26	Or you could see the first time the two curves diverged,
616.26	as shown on the left.
618.26	When did the randoms -- when did the friends take off
621.26	and leave the randoms,
623.26	and [when did] their curve start shifting?
625.26	And that, as indicated by the white line,
627.26	occurred 46 days
629.26	before the peak of the epidemic.
631.26	So this would be a technique
633.26	whereby we could get more than a month-and-a-half warning
635.26	about a flu epidemic in a particular population.
638.26	I should say that
640.26	how far advanced a notice one might get about something
642.26	depends on a host of factors.
644.26	It could depend on the nature of the pathogen --
646.26	different pathogens,
648.26	using this technique, you'd get different warning --
650.26	or other phenomena that are spreading,
652.26	or frankly, on the structure of the human network.
655.26	Now in our case, although it wasn't necessary,
658.26	we could also actually map the network of the students.
660.26	So, this is a map of 714 students
662.26	and their friendship ties.
664.26	And in a minute now, I'm going to put this map into motion.
666.26	We're going to take daily cuts through the network
668.26	for 120 days.
670.26	The red dots are going to be cases of the flu,
673.26	and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu.
676.26	And the size of the dots is going to be proportional
678.26	to how many of their friends have the flu.
680.26	So bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu.
683.26	And if you look at this image -- here we are now in September the 13th --
686.26	you're going to see a few cases light up.
688.26	You're going to see kind of blooming of the flu in the middle.
690.26	Here we are on October the 19th.
693.26	The slope of the epidemic curve is approaching now, in November.
695.26	Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang -- you're going to see lots of blooming in the middle,
698.26	and then you're going to see a sort of leveling off,
700.26	fewer and fewer cases towards the end of December.
703.26	And this type of a visualization
705.26	can show that epidemics like this take root
707.26	and affect central individuals first,
709.26	before they affect others.
711.26	Now, as I've been suggesting,
713.26	this method is not restricted to germs,
716.26	but actually to anything that spreads in populations.
718.26	Information spreads in populations,
720.26	norms can spread in populations,
722.26	behaviors can spread in populations.
724.26	And by behaviors, I can mean things like criminal behavior,
727.26	or voting behavior, or health care behavior,
730.26	like smoking, or vaccination,
732.26	or product adoption, or other kinds of behaviors
734.26	that relate to interpersonal influence.
736.26	If I'm likely to do something that affects others around me,
739.26	this technique can get early warning or early detection
742.26	about the adoption within the population.
745.26	The key thing is that for it to work,
747.26	there has to be interpersonal influence.
749.26	It cannot be because of some broadcast mechanism
751.26	affecting everyone uniformly.
755.26	Now the same insights
757.26	can also be exploited -- with respect to networks --
760.26	can also be exploited in other ways,
763.26	for example, in the use of targeting
765.26	specific people for interventions.
767.26	So, for example, most of you are probably familiar
769.26	with the notion of herd immunity.
771.26	So, if we have a population of a thousand people,
774.26	and we want to make the population immune to a pathogen,
777.26	we don't have to immunize every single person.
779.26	If we immunize 960 of them,
781.26	it's as if we had immunized a hundred [percent] of them.
784.26	Because even if one or two of the non-immune people gets infected,
787.26	there's no one for them to infect.
789.26	They are surrounded by immunized people.
791.26	So 96 percent is as good as 100 percent.
794.26	Well, some other scientists have estimated
796.26	what would happen if you took a 30 percent random sample
798.26	of these 1000 people, 300 people and immunized them.
801.26	Would you get any population-level immunity?
803.26	And the answer is no.
806.26	But if you took this 30 percent, these 300 people
808.26	and had them nominate their friends
810.26	and took the same number of vaccine doses
813.26	and vaccinated the friends of the 300 --
815.26	the 300 friends --
817.26	you can get the same level of herd immunity
819.26	as if you had vaccinated 96 percent of the population
822.26	at a much greater efficiency, with a strict budget constraint.
825.26	And similar ideas can be used, for instance,
827.26	to target distribution of things like bed nets
829.26	in the developing world.
831.26	If we could understand the structure of networks in villages,
834.26	we could target to whom to give the interventions
836.26	to foster these kinds of spreads.
838.26	Or, frankly, for advertising with all kinds of products.
841.26	If we could understand how to target,
843.26	it could affect the efficiency
845.26	of what we're trying to achieve.
847.26	And in fact, we can use data
849.26	from all kinds of sources nowadays [to do this].
851.26	This is a map of eight million phone users
853.26	in a European country.
855.26	Every dot is a person, and every line represents
857.26	a volume of calls between the people.
859.26	And we can use such data, that's being passively obtained,
862.26	to map these whole countries
864.26	and understand who is located where within the network.
867.26	Without actually having to query them at all,
869.26	we can get this kind of a structural insight.
871.26	And other sources of information, as you're no doubt aware
874.26	are available about such features, from email interactions,
877.26	online interactions,
879.26	online social networks and so forth.
882.26	And in fact, we are in the era of what I would call
884.26	"""massive-passive"" data collection efforts."
887.26	They're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data
890.26	to create sensor networks
893.26	to follow the population,
895.26	understand what's happening in the population,
897.26	and intervene in the population for the better.
900.26	Because these new technologies tell us
902.26	not just who is talking to whom,
904.26	but where everyone is,
906.26	and what they're thinking based on what they're uploading on the Internet,
909.26	and what they're buying based on their purchases.
911.26	And all this administrative data can be pulled together
914.26	and processed to understand human behavior
916.26	in a way we never could before.
919.26	So, for example, we could use truckers' purchases of fuel.
922.26	So the truckers are just going about their business,
924.26	and they're buying fuel.
926.26	And we see a blip up in the truckers' purchases of fuel,
929.26	and we know that a recession is about to end.
931.26	Or we can monitor the velocity
933.26	with which people are moving with their phones on a highway,
936.26	and the phone company can see,
938.26	as the velocity is slowing down,
940.26	that there's a traffic jam.
942.26	And they can feed that information back to their subscribers,
945.26	but only to their subscribers on the same highway
947.26	located behind the traffic jam!
949.26	Or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors, passively,
952.26	and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals
955.26	occurs within [networks of] doctors.
957.26	Or again, we can monitor purchasing behavior in people
959.26	and watch how these types of phenomena
961.26	can diffuse within human populations.
964.26	And there are three ways, I think,
966.26	that these massive-passive data can be used.
968.26	One is fully passive,
970.26	like I just described --
972.26	as in, for instance, the trucker example,
974.26	where we don't actually intervene in the population in any way.
976.26	One is quasi-active,
978.26	like the flu example I gave,
980.26	where we get some people to nominate their friends
983.26	and then passively monitor their friends --
985.26	do they have the flu, or not? -- and then get warning.
987.26	Or another example would be,
989.26	if you're a phone company, you figure out who's central in the network
992.26	"and you ask those people, ""Look, will you just text us your fever every day?"
995.26	"Just text us your temperature."""
997.26	And collect vast amounts of information about people's temperature,
1000.26	but from centrally located individuals.
1002.26	And be able, on a large scale,
1004.26	to monitor an impending epidemic
1006.26	with very minimal input from people.
1008.26	Or, finally, it can be more fully active --
1010.26	as I know subsequent speakers will also talk about today --
1012.26	where people might globally participate in wikis,
1014.26	or photographing, or monitoring elections,
1017.26	and upload information in a way that allows us to pool
1019.26	information in order to understand social processes
1021.26	and social phenomena.
1023.26	In fact, the availability of these data, I think,
1025.26	heralds a kind of new era
1027.26	of what I and others would like to call
1029.26	"""computational social science."""
1031.26	It's sort of like when Galileo invented -- or, didn't invent --
1034.26	came to use a telescope
1036.26	and could see the heavens in a new way,
1038.26	or Leeuwenhoek became aware of the microscope --
1040.26	or actually invented --
1042.26	and could see biology in a new way.
1044.26	But now we have access to these kinds of data
1046.26	that allow us to understand social processes
1048.26	and social phenomena
1050.26	in an entirely new way that was never before possible.
1053.26	And with this science, we can
1055.26	understand how exactly
1057.26	the whole comes to be greater
1059.26	than the sum of its parts.
1061.26	And actually, we can use these insights
1063.26	to improve society and improve human well-being.
1066.26	Thank you.
