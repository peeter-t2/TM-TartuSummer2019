12.26	The best Christmas my children ever had
15.42	was also the worst Christmas
15.42	my husband and I ever had.
19.62	Elizabeth, age seven,
21.46	and her brother, Ian, age five,
24.34	couldn't imagine why they were getting
24.34	everything they wanted for Christmas.
29.06	The reason Santa was so generous
32.58	was because of something
32.58	my husband Pat and I knew
35.86	and the kids couldn't comprehend.
38.26	Something that we had just learned,
38.26	and it terrified us.
43.38	This was 1994
45.66	and the story actually starts
45.66	a few years earlier.
48.62	For a couple of years I had noticed
48.62	a rash on the sides of Elizabeth's neck
54.22	that looked like prickly heat.
56.78	For those same years,
56.78	my father and brother both died of cancer,
61.42	and I was probably
61.42	overanxious about illness.
64.94	The doctors assured us
64.94	there was nothing wrong
67.74	and I shouldn't worry,
69.5	but I wasn't so sure.
72.02	And so without a referral,
72.02	and paying out-of-pocket,
75.14	I took Elizabeth to a dermatologist.
78.38	She was probably
78.38	just allergic to something,
80.74	but why did it appear
80.74	just on the sides of her neck, this rash?
86.66	So it's two days before Christmas,
91.02	and the dermatologist
91.02	takes a quick look at her neck and says,
94.42	"""She has pseudoxanthoma elasticum."""
97.46	And then he shuts off the lights
97.46	and looks in her eyes.
102.14	It turns out, by chance,
103.82	this dermatologist
103.82	also trained in ophthalmology.
107.9	Our lucky day.
111.22	I am sick to my stomach.
113.46	"""Oma?"""
114.74	Oma's like melanoma, lymphoma --
117.66	cancer.
119.66	"""Why are you looking"
119.66	"in her eyes for a skin rash?"""
123.42	I scream and make no sound.
126.54	So there it is.
128.62	Elizabeth has pseudoxanthoma elasticum,
133.26	PXE for short.
136.7	Questions mix with fear
139.02	and erupt like bile in my throat.
141.739	Why are you looking in her eyes?
144.66	What do you know about this?
144.66	How do you know for sure?
147.66	What is the prognosis?
150.02	My training in pastoral counseling
150.02	did not prepare me for this.
155.5	Dr. Bercovitch tells us
155.5	everything he knows about PXE.
160.66	It's a rare genetic disorder,
163.62	it's systemic,
165.86	it's a slowly progressing,
165.86	premature aging disease.
170.66	It causes loose wrinkly skin
170.66	in the flexor areas.
175.42	It causes legal blindness,
177.38	like macular degeneration,
179.78	and a host of cardiovascular problems.
183.5	Little is known about this disease,
186.42	and some people die in their 30s,
189.26	say some of the reports at the time.
193.26	He then just glances at our son and says,
197.94	"""He has it, too."""
201.22	We want to flee
201.22	back to the land of normal.
210.74	Two days after Christmas,
212.18	researchers come
212.18	from a university in Boston,
215.22	and they take blood
215.22	from us and our children
217.74	for a research project
217.74	focused on finding the gene.
221.18	A few days later,
222.58	researchers come
222.58	from a medical center in New York
225.02	and say they want blood, too.
227.34	"""These are children."
229.38	They're five and seven years old.
231.5	Don't make them face the needle twice.
234.18	Go and get your share
234.18	"from the other researchers."""
238.26	They laugh, incredulous.
240.5	"""Share?"""
243.02	It is then that we learn that there
243.02	is little sharing in biomedical research.
248.34	This moment, more than any other,
251.06	lit a fire beneath my husband Pat and me.
255.46	Pat and I went to a medical school library
257.66	and we copied every article
257.66	we could find on PXE.
261.54	We didn't understand a thing.
264.66	We bought medical dictionaries
264.66	and scientific textbooks
267.42	and read everything
267.42	we could get our hands on.
270.38	And though we still didn't understand,
272.26	we could see patterns,
274.14	and it became quickly
274.14	apparent within a month
277.54	that there was no systematic effort
277.54	to understand PXE.
282.82	In addition,
284.06	the lack of sharing
284.06	that we experienced was pervasive.
288.3	Researchers competed with each other
291.46	because the ecosystem
291.46	was designed to reward competition
296.38	rather than to alleviate suffering.
299.66	We realized that we would have to do
299.66	work on this condition ourselves
304.7	to find solutions
304.7	for ourselves and others like us.
309.38	But we faced two major barriers.
311.74	The first one:
313.26	Pat and I have no science background.
316.74	At the time, he's the manager
316.74	of a construction company,
320.18	and I'm a former college chaplain
320.18	stay-at-home mom --
324.06	hardly the backgrounds
324.06	to take the research world by storm.
329.3	The second barrier:
332.18	researchers don't share.
334.82	People told us you can't herd cats.
338.46	Well, yes you can if you move their food.
342.02	(Laughter)
345.22	(Applause)
349.22	DNA and clinical data is the food.
352.78	So we would collect blood
352.78	and medical histories,
355.94	and require that all scientists
355.94	using these resources
359.54	would share results with each other
359.54	and with the people who donated.
364.9	Well before the internet
364.9	was in common use,
367.14	Pat and I established PXE International,
370.02	a nonprofit dedicated to initiating
370.02	research and conducting it on PXE
374.94	and also supporting
374.94	individuals with the disease.
379.66	Using traditional media,
381.02	we garnered around
385.46	who we asked,
386.74	would you give us your blood,
386.74	your tissue, your medical histories,
390.02	your medical records?
392.02	And we brought all of that together.
394.74	We quickly learned that this shared
394.74	resource was not going to be enough.
399.74	And so we decided we had
399.74	to do hardcore bench science --
405.1	hardcore research.
407.22	So we borrowed bench space
407.22	at a lab at Harvard.
410.02	A wonderful neighbor
410.02	came a couple times a week
412.82	and sat with the kids from 8pm to 2am
416.9	while Pat and I extracted DNA,
419.26	ran and scored gels
421.02	and searched for the gene.
423.06	Generous postdocs
423.06	tutored us as we went along.
426.46	Within a few years, we found the gene.
429.18	We patented it so that
429.18	it would be freely available.
432.22	We created a diagnostic test.
434.3	We put together a research consortium.
437.42	We held research meetings
437.42	and opened a center of excellence.
441.18	We found more than 4,000 people
441.18	around the world who had PXE,
446.58	and held patient meetings
448.54	and did clinical trials and studies.
452.66	Through all this,
454.18	we lived with fear.
456.86	Fear of the disease
456.86	breathing down our neck
461.18	while the clock ticked.
463.1	Fear of researchers,
466.02	so well credentialed and positioned
466.02	in a world made for them.
470.74	Fear that we were making
470.74	the wrong choices.
474.26	Fear that the naysayers were right
476.62	and the cats would simply find a new food.
480.62	But greater than all these fears
480.62	was our drive to make a difference
483.82	for our kids and for all those
483.82	we had met along the way.
488.1	And very quickly,
489.34	we also realized what we
489.34	were doing for one disease,
492.1	we should do for all diseases.
496.02	We joined with, and I eventually led,
497.86	Genetic Alliance --
499.1	a network of health advocacy,
501.42	patient advocacy,
502.66	research and health organizations.
504.98	We built scalable
504.98	and extensible resources,
507.46	like biobanks and registries
507.46	and directories of support
510.3	for all diseases.
512.62	And as I learned about all those diseases
512.62	and all those disease communities,
516.7	I realized that there were
516.7	two secrets in health care
519.58	that were impacting me greatly.
522.3	The first:
523.58	there are no ready answers
523.58	for people like my kids
527.02	or all the people I was working with,
528.979	whether common or rare conditions.
531.739	And the second secret:
533.58	the answers lie in all of us together,
537.7	donating our data,
540.06	our biological samples
542.38	and ultimately ourselves.
546.26	There is a small
546.26	groundswell of individuals
549.62	who are working to change this.
551.9	Citizen scientists, activists, hacks
554.98	who are using crowdsourcing,
554.98	do-it-yourself science
558.18	are changing the game.
560.42	Even President Obama
560.42	and Vice President Biden
564.5	are evangelists for the idea
566.22	that people should be
566.22	partners in research.
569.5	This is a founding principle
569.5	of our organization.
572.78	Sure, it's really hard
574.94	to discover and develop
574.94	interventions and therapies.
579.3	The science is hard,
581.66	the regulatory regime is difficult.
584.78	There are a lot of stakeholders
584.78	with lots of interests
587.82	and misaligned incentives
587.82	like publishing, promotion and tenure.
593.18	I don't fault scientists
593.18	for following this path,
596.62	but I challenge them and us
596.62	to do this differently.
600.22	To recognize that people
600.22	are at the center.
605.22	Genetic Alliance has experimented
607.02	in what it will take
607.02	to transform these crusty systems.
612.74	Our goal is to work without boundaries.
615.7	That sounds abstract,
615.7	but for us it's quite practical.
621.22	When we're frustrated
621.22	that entities won't share data --
624.94	data that comes from people who gave
624.94	their energy, their time, their blood
630.06	and even their tears --
632.34	we need to stop and ask,
633.98	"""How is it true that we"
633.98	"could share, but we aren't?"""
637.66	We're part of this system, too.
642.26	How do we make it
642.26	so that people can share ideas freely?
647.22	So that people can take risks
647.22	and move closer to one another?
653.3	This leads to a dissolving
653.3	of us versus them,
656.58	not only for organizations
656.58	but also for individuals.
660.54	If I'm going to ask
660.54	organizations or individuals
663.94	to strive for these standards,
666.18	then I too need to explore
666.18	my own being and my practices.
671.94	If I'm going to ask clinicians
671.94	and researchers and administrators
675.22	to take risks,
676.82	then I, Sharon,
676.82	need to take risks as well.
680.66	I need to face my personal fears.
684.5	My fear of not having enough impact.
689.22	My fear of not leading well.
692.82	My fear of not being enough.
698.54	Just before they entered their teens,
698.54	our kids stopped us in our tracks
702.5	"and said, ""You have to stop worrying"
702.5	about making a difference,
706.22	making an impact,
707.5	and instead, like us,
707.5	learn to live with disease
711.5	"rather than fight it."""
716.42	I have to ask,
717.74	where does all my fear come from?
721.14	The kids' declaration
721.14	shines a spotlight on that fear.
725.58	It arises from a bedrock of love.
729.74	I love Elizabeth and Ian.
734.14	I love people with PXE.
737.34	I love people with any disease.
740.54	I love people.
744.34	Some of my colleagues have discovered
744.34	that it is not death we fear,
748.98	it is the enormity of our loving.
752.58	This expansive love opens me to great pain
757.38	as I face loss.
760.86	As I discover my fear,
763.98	I discover that I
765.78	and all those around me
767.42	have boundless capacity for love.
773.46	And I also discover
776.06	as I move into this fear,
779.22	that I can learn many new things
781.7	and find paths
784.14	to things like practical solutions
788.02	as well as the core of healing and health.
794.82	I don't fear fear the way I used to.
800.38	In fact lately, with enormous support
800.38	from all my fellow journeyers,
805.54	I notice that it's not a warning
805.54	the way it used to be.
809.86	I notice that instead,
812.74	it's an invitation to go forward
814.66	because in it lies love
814.66	and the path to greater love.
819.46	If I turn with gentle curiosity
819.46	toward that fear,
824.62	I find enormous wealth
824.62	within myself and others
829.7	and the ability to step into challenges
829.7	that I never thought I could.
834.78	My kids are ahead of me
834.78	on that path still.
838.18	At ages 29 and 27,
840.1	they declare they are happy and healthy
842.58	despite having manifestations of PXE
842.58	in their skin and eyes and arteries.
848.98	And so I invite you, us, we,
852.34	to turn toward our fear;
853.94	to embrace the things that scare us
856.9	and find the love at the center.
859.06	We'll not only find ourselves there
861.3	but we'll also be able
861.3	to step into the shoes of those we fear
865.3	and those who fear us.
867.26	If we breathe into that fear
870.38	and are vulnerable with the systems
870.38	and people who challenge us,
875.06	our power as changemakers
875.06	grows exponentially.
880.22	And when we realize
881.5	that working on our inner life
881.5	is working on our outer life
885.18	and outer work is inner work,
887.94	we get down to what is real
890.1	and shit gets done.
891.54	(Laughter)
893.02	There is no limit
893.02	to what we can accomplish together.
896.86	Thank you.
898.1	(Applause)
