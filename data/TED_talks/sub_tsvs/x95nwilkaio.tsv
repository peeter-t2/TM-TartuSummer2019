12.958	So when I was in Morocco,
15.158	in Casablanca, not so long ago,
17.692	I met a young unmarried mother called Faiza.
22.168	Faiza showed me photos of her infant son
25.505	and she told me the story of his conception,
25.505	pregnancy, and delivery.
31.64	It was a remarkable tale,
33.6	but Faiza saved the best for last.
37.28	"""You know, I am a virgin,"" she told me."
40.85	"""I have two medical certificates to prove it."""
45.254	This is the modern Middle East,
47.878	where two millennia after the coming of Christ,
50.51	virgin births are still a fact of life.
54.738	Faiza's story is just one of hundreds I've heard 
54.738	over the years, traveling across the Arab region
60.395	talking to people about sex.
63.683	Now, I know this might sound like a dream job,
66.899	or possibly a highly dubious occupation,
70.167	but for me, it's something else altogether.
73.523	I'm half Egyptian, and I'm Muslim.
76.111	But I grew up in Canada, far from my Arab roots.
79.902	Like so many who straddle East and West,
82.536	I've been drawn, over the years, to try to better
82.536	understand my origins.
87.459	That I chose to look at sex comes from 
87.459	my background in HIV/AIDS,
91.579	as a writer and a researcher and an activist.
95.666	Sex lies at the heart of an emerging epidemic
95.666	in the Middle East and North Africa,
100.79	which is one of only two regions in the world
100.79	where HIV/AIDS is still on the rise.
107.335	Now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens
110.376	with which to study any society,
113.1	because what happens in our intimate lives
115.609	is reflected by forces on a bigger stage:
119.783	in politics and economics, in religion and tradition, 
119.783	in gender and generations.
125.857	As I found, if you really want to know a people,
129.144	you start by looking inside their bedrooms.
133.668	Now to be sure, the Arab world is vast and varied.
137.86	But running across it are three red lines --
140.521	these are topics you are not supposed 
140.521	to challenge in word or deed.
145.735	The first of these is politics.
148.15	But the Arab Spring has changed all that,
150.578	in uprisings which have blossomed 
150.578	across the region since 2011.
155.6	Now while those in power, old and new,
158.461	continue to cling to business as usual,
161.263	millions are still pushing back,
163.869	and pushing forward to what they hope
163.869	will be a better life.
168.984	That second red line is religion.
172.164	But now religion and politics are connected,
174.995	with the rise of such groups as the 
174.995	Muslim Brotherhood.
178.139	And some people, at least, are starting 
178.139	to ask questions
181.599	about the role of Islam in public and private life.
186.667	You know, as for that third red line, 
186.667	that off-limits subject,
190.418	what do you think it might be?
192.196	Audience: Sex.
193.258	Shereen El Feki: Louder, I can't hear you.
194.558	Audience: Sex.
195.414	SEF: Again, please don't be shy.
197.036	Audience: Sex.
198.088	SEF: Absolutely, that's right, it's sex. (Laughter)
205.145	Across the Arab region, the only accepted
205.145	context for sex is marriage --
211.353	approved by your parents, sanctioned by religion
215.131	and registered by the state.
217.671	Marriage is your ticket to adulthood.
220.554	If you don't tie the knot, you can't 
220.554	move out of your parents' place,
224.379	and you're not supposed to be having sex,
226.68	and you're definitely not supposed 
226.68	to be having children.
229.827	It's a social citadel; it's an impregnable fortress
233.193	which resists any assault, any alternative.
237.658	And around the fortress is this vast field of taboo
241.666	against premarital sex, against condoms,
246.639	against abortion, against homosexuality,
249.583	you name it.
251.754	Faiza was living proof of this.
254.978	Her virginity statement was 
254.978	not a piece of wishful thinking.
259.259	Although the major religions of the region
259.259	extoll premarital chastity,
264.582	in a patriarchy, boys will be boys.
267.886	Men have sex before marriage,
269.839	and people more or less turn a blind eye.
273.629	Not so for women,
275.845	who are expected to be virgins 
275.845	on their wedding night --
278.889	that is, to turn up with your hymen intact.
283.139	This is not a question of individual concern,
286.814	this is a matter of family honor, 
286.814	and in particular, men's honor.
291.956	And so women and their relatives
293.714	will go to great lengths to preserve 
293.714	this tiny piece of anatomy --
298.073	from female genital mutilation,
300.278	to virginity testing, to hymen repair surgery.
304.639	Faiza chose a different route:
307.645	non-vaginal sex.
310.028	Only she became pregnant all the same.
312.637	But Faiza didn't actually realize this,
315.377	because there's so little 
315.377	sexuality education in schools,
319.152	and so little communication in the family.
323.174	When her condition became hard to hide,
325.929	Faiza's mother helped her flee 
325.929	her father and brothers.
330.376	This is because honor killings are a real threat
333.397	for untold numbers of women in the Arab region.
337.171	And so when Faiza eventually fetched up at 
337.171	a hospital in Casablanca,
342.221	the man who offered to help her,
344.898	instead tried to rape her.
350.35	Sadly, Faiza is not alone.
353.459	In Egypt, where my research is focused,
355.245	I have seen plenty of trouble 
355.245	in and out of the citadel.
360.843	There are legions of young men
364.182	who can't afford to get married,
366.289	because marriage has become 
366.289	a very expensive proposition.
369.713	They are expected to bear the burden
369.713	of costs in married life,
373.272	but they can't find jobs.
375.576	This is one of the major drivers 
375.576	of the recent uprisings,
378.75	and it is one of the reasons for the 
378.75	rising age of marriage
381.915	in much of the Arab region.
384.946	There are career women who want to get married,
387.721	but can't find a husband,
389.319	because they defy gender expectations,
392.504	or as one young female doctor 
392.504	in Tunisia put it to me,
396.291	"""The women, they are becoming more and more open."
398.998	"But the man, he is still at the prehistoric stage."""
404.801	And then there are men and women who 
404.801	cross the heterosexual line,
408.691	who have sex with their own sex,
410.593	or who have a different gender identity.
413.602	They are on the receiving end of laws
413.602	which punish their activities,
417.555	even their appearance.
419.613	And they face a daily struggle with social stigma,
423.448	with family despair,
425.083	and with religious fire and brimstone.
429.251	Now, it's not as if it's all rosy 
429.251	in the marital bed either.
433.449	Couples who are looking for greater happiness,
435.975	greater sexual happiness in their married lives,
438.614	but are at a loss of how to achieve it,
440.973	especially wives, who are afraid 
440.973	of being seen as bad women
445.495	if they show some spark in the bedroom.
448.699	And then there are those whose marriages
450.623	are actually a veil for prostitution.
453.729	They have been sold by their families,
455.887	often to wealthy Arab tourists.
458.768	This is just one face of a booming 
458.768	sex trade across the Arab region.
464.369	Now raise your hand if any of 
464.369	this is sounding familiar to you,
468.557	from your part of the world.
472.527	Yeah. It's not as if the Arab world
472.527	has a monopoly on sexual hangups.
478.537	And although we don't yet have
478.537	an Arab Kinsey Report
481.507	to tell us exactly what's happening 
481.507	inside bedrooms across the Arab region,
485.92	It's pretty clear that 
485.92	something is not right.
489.863	Double standards for men and women,
492.551	sex as a source of shame,
495.81	family control limiting individual choices,
499.961	and a vast gulf between appearance and reality:
503.708	what people are doing
505.294	and what they're willing to admit to,
507.639	and a general reluctance to move 
507.639	beyond private whispers
511.615	to a serious and sustained public discussion.
515.703	As one doctor in Cairo summed it up for me,
519.192	"""Here, sex is the opposite of sport."
522.517	Football, everybody talks about it,
524.683	but hardly anyone plays.
526.653	But sex, everybody is doing it,
528.626	"but nobody wants to talk about it."""
528.626	(Laughter)
532.775	(Music) (In Arabic)
543.348	SEF: I want to give you a piece of advice,
546.007	which if you follow it,
546.007	will make you happy in life.
550.101	When your husband reaches out to you,
552.476	when he seizes a part of your body,
555.288	sigh deeply and look at him lustily.
558.654	When he penetrates you with his penis,
561.177	try to talk flirtatiously and 
561.177	move yourself in harmony with him.
566.47	Hot stuff!
567.928	And it might sound that these handy hints
569.922	"come from ""The Joy of Sex"" or YouPorn."
573.033	But in fact, they come from
573.033	a 10th-century Arabic book
576.885	"called ""The Encyclopedia of Pleasure,"""
579.217	which covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia,
583.365	and everything in between.
586.438	The Encyclopedia is just one 
586.438	in a long line of Arabic erotica,
590.496	much of it written by religious scholars.
593.725	Going right back to the Prophet Muhammad,
596.086	there is a rich tradition in Islam
598.503	of talking frankly about sex:
601.083	not just its problems, but also its pleasures,
604.378	and not just for men, but also for women.
608.953	A thousand years ago, we used to have 
608.953	whole dictionaries of sex in Arabic.
614.82	Words to cover every conceivable sexual feature,
618.973	position and preference, a body of language
622.565	that was rich enough to make up the body 
622.565	of the woman you see on this page.
629.096	Today, this history is largely unknown 
629.096	in the Arab region.
632.699	Even by educated people, who often
632.699	feel more comfortable talking about sex
637.503	in a foreign language than they do
637.503	in their own tongue.
642.481	Today's sexual landscape looks
642.481	a lot like Europe and America
646.204	on the brink of the sexual revolution.
648.937	But while the West has opened on sex,
651.985	what we found is that Arab societies appear
651.985	to have been moving in the opposite direction.
658.618	In Egypt and many of its neighbors,
660.873	this closing down is part of a wider closing
663.75	in political, social and cultural thought.
667.333	And it is the product of a complex historical process,
671.389	one which has gained ground with the rise 
671.389	of Islamic conservatism
675.182	since the late 1970s.
678.183	"""Just say no"" is what conservatives "
678.183	around the world
681.858	say to any challenge to the sexual status quo.
686.32	In the Arab region, they brand these attempts
686.32	as a Western conspiracy
690.606	to undermine traditional Arab
690.606	and Islamic values.
694.908	But what's really at stake here
696.907	is one of their most powerful tools of control:
700.801	sex wrapped up in religion.
704.958	But history shows us that 
704.958	even as recently
708.103	as our fathers' and grandfathers' day,
711.012	there have been times of greater pragmatism,
713.961	and tolerance, and a willingness
713.961	to consider other interpretations:
719.481	be it abortion, or masturbation, or even 
719.481	the incendiary topic of homosexuality.
726.4	It is not black and white,
726.4	as conservatives would have us believe.
731.266	In these, as in so many other matters,
734.473	Islam offers us at least 50 shades of gray.
737.894	(Laughter)
740.308	Over my travels,
741.457	I've met men and women 
741.457	across the Arab region
744.065	who've been exploring that spectrum --
747.058	sexologists who are trying
747.058	to help couples
749.762	find greater happiness in their marriages,
753.684	innovators who are managing to get 
753.684	sexuality education into schools,
759.366	small groups of men and women,
761.733	lesbian, gay, transgendered, transsexual,
764.449	who are reaching out to their peers
766.13	with online initiatives and real-world support.
770.788	Women, and increasingly men,
770.788	who are starting to speak out
774.751	and push back against sexual violence
777.837	on the streets and in the home.
781.393	Groups that are trying to help sex workers
781.393	protect themselves against HIV
786.126	and other occupational hazards,
788.993	and NGOs that are helping unwed mothers like Faiza
792.921	find a place in society, and critically,
792.921	stay with their kids.
798.702	Now these efforts are small, 
798.702	they're often underfunded,
802.113	and they face formidable opposition.
805.416	But I am optimistic that, in the long run,
808.944	times are changing, and they and their ideas
812.321	will gain ground.
814.25	Social change doesn't happen in the Arab region
814.25	through dramatic confrontation,
819.902	beating or indeed baring of breasts,
823.289	but rather through negotiation.
825.754	What we're talking here is not about a 
825.754	sexual revolution,
829.424	but a sexual evolution, 
829.424	learning from other parts of the world,
833.898	adapting to local conditions,
836.274	forging our own path,
836.274	not following one blazed by another.
842.161	That path, I hope, will one day lead us 
842.161	to the right to control our own bodies,
848.604	and to access the information 
848.604	and services we need
851.674	to lead satisfying and safe sexual lives.
856.078	The right to express our ideas freely,
858.648	to marry whom we choose, 
858.648	to choose our own partners,
863.303	to be sexually active or not,
863.303	to decide whether to have children and when,
868.155	all this without violence or force or discrimination.
874.534	Now we are very far from this 
874.534	across the Arab region,
877.938	and so much needs to change:
881.045	law, education, media, the economy,
884.973	the list goes on and on,
887.846	and it is the work of a generation, at least.
892.164	But it begins with a journey that I myself have made,
895.326	asking hard questions of received wisdoms
898.295	in sexual life.
900.103	And it is a journey which has
900.103	only served to strengthen my faith,
904.616	and my appreciation of local histories and cultures
908.134	by showing me possibilities 
908.134	where I once only saw absolutes.
913.929	Now given the turmoil in many
913.929	countries in the Arab region,
917.386	talking about sex, 
917.386	challenging the taboos,
920.463	seeking alternatives might sound like
920.463	something of a luxury.
925.799	But at this critical moment in history,
928.591	if we do not anchor freedom and justice,
932.969	dignity and equality,
934.601	privacy and autonomy in our personal lives,
934.601	in our sexual lives,
939.843	we will find it very hard to achieve in public life.
944.144	The political and the sexual are intimate bedfellows,
944.144	and that is true for us all.
950.899	no matter where we live and love.
954.31	Thank you.
955.826	(Applause)
