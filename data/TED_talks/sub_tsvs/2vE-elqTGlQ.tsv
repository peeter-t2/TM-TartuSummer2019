12.58	So 24 years ago,
14.38	I was brought to The New Yorker
16.18	as art editor
18.3	to rejuvenate
21.86	what had by then become
21.86	a somewhat staid institution
26.9	and to bring in new artists
29.42	and to try to bring the magazine
29.42	from its ivory tower
33.14	into engaging with its time.
36.5	And it was just
36.5	the right thing for me to do
39.22	because I've always been captivated
39.22	by how an image can --
43.86	a simple drawing --
45.58	can cut through the torrent of images
45.58	that we see every single day.
50.34	How it can capture a moment,
52.82	how it can crystallize
52.82	a social trend or a complex event
58.06	in a way that a lot of words
58.06	wouldn't be able to do --
63.26	and reduce it to its essence
63.26	and turn it into a cartoon.
67.62	So I went to the library
69.42	and I looked at the first cover
69.42	drawn by Rea Irvin in 1925 --
75.38	a dandy looking at a butterfly
75.38	through his monocle,
80.58	and we call it Eustace Tilley.
83.9	And I realized that
83.9	as the magazine had become known
87.94	for its in-depth research
87.94	and long reports,
93.42	some of the humor
93.42	had gotten lost along the way,
96.38	because now often Eustace Tilley
96.38	was seen as a haughty dandy,
101.3	but in fact, in 1925,
104.42	when Rea Irvin first drew this image,
107.86	he did it as part of a humor magazine
110.66	to amuse the youth of the era,
112.9	which was the flappers
112.9	of the roaring twenties.
116.9	And in the library,
118.18	I found the images
118.18	that really captured the zeitgeist
123.14	of the Great Depression.
125.58	And it showed us
125.58	not just how people dressed
130.02	or what their cars looked like,
131.58	but also what made them laugh,
134.86	what their prejudices were.
137.18	And you really got a sense
139.78	of what it felt like
139.78	to be alive in the '30s.
143.78	So I called on contemporary artists,
147.18	such as Adrian Tomine here.
149.42	I often call on narrative artists --
152.58	cartoonists, children's book authors --
155.26	and I give them themes such as,
158.66	you know, what it's like
158.66	to be in the subway,
161.02	or Valentine's Day,
163.22	and they send me sketches.
164.62	And once the sketches
164.62	are approved by the editor,
168.54	David Remnick,
171.06	it's a go.
173.18	And I love the way
175.18	those images are actually
175.18	not telling you what to think.
180.46	But they do make you think,
182.7	because the artist is actually --
187.74	it's almost a puzzle;
189.02	the artist is drawing the dots,
190.54	and you, the reader,
190.54	have to complete the picture.
194.26	So to get this image
194.26	on the left by Anita Kunz,
197.66	or the one on right by Tomer Hanuka,
200.74	you have to play spot the differences.
203.9	And it is something that ...
207.54	It's really exciting to see
211.26	how the engagement with the reader ...
217.34	how those images really capture --
222.3	play with the stereotypes.
223.86	But when you get it,
225.26	it rearranges the stereotypes
225.26	that are in your head.
229.38	But the images don't
229.38	just have to show people,
232.7	sometimes it can be a feeling.
235.06	Right after September 11,
237.94	I was at a point,
240.62	like everybody else,
241.86	where I really didn't know how to deal
241.86	with what we were going through,
247.1	and I felt that no image
247.1	could capture this moment,
252.54	and I wanted to just do a black cover,
255.06	like no cover.
256.78	And I talked to my husband,
256.78	cartoonist Art Spiegelman,
260.5	and mentioned to him
260.5	that I was going to propose that,
264.38	"and he said, ""Oh, if you're"
264.38	going to do a black cover,
266.98	then why don't you do
266.98	the silhouette of the Twin Towers,
271.02	"black on black?"""
272.58	And I sat down to draw this,
274.14	and as soon as I saw it,
276.74	a shiver ran down my spine
278.3	and I realized
280.46	that in this refusal to make an image,
284.14	we had found a way to capture loss
289.18	and mourning
290.7	and absence.
293.7	And it's been a profound thing
293.7	that I learned in the process --
298.1	that sometimes some of the images
298.1	that say the most
304.06	do it with the most spare means.
307.7	And a simple image can speak volumes.
311.3	So this is the image
311.3	that we published by Bob Staake
314.58	right after the election of Barack Obama,
319.86	and captured a historic moment.
323.14	But we can't really plan for this,
325.38	because in order to do this,
326.78	we have to let the artist
326.78	experience the emotions that we all feel
333.14	when that is happening.
335.14	So back in November 2016,
338.98	during the election last year,
341.78	the only image that we
341.78	could publish was this,
344.94	which was on the stand
344.94	on the week that everybody voted.
348.9	(Laughter)
350.26	Because we knew
350.26	somebody would feel this --
352.74	(Laughter)
353.98	when the result of the election
353.98	was announced.
358.18	And when we found out the result,
362.42	we really were at a loss,
364.3	and this is the image
364.3	that was sent by Bob Staake again,
370.34	and that really hit a chord.
374.1	And again,
375.38	we can't really figure out
375.38	what's going to come next,
381.86	but here it felt like we didn't
381.86	know how to move forward,
384.58	but we did move forward,
386.06	and this is the image that we published
386.06	after Donald Trump's election
392.3	and at the time of the Women's March
395.74	all over the US.
397.94	So over those 24 years,
399.82	I have seen over 1,000 images
399.82	come to life week after week,
404.62	and I'm often asked
404.62	which one is my favorite,
407.22	but I can't pick one
409.1	because what I'm most proud of
409.1	is how different every image is,
415.06	one from the other.
416.3	And that's due to the talent
416.3	and the diversity
419.78	of all of the artists that contribute.
423.42	And now, well,
425.22	now, we're owned by Russia,
427.1	so --
428.34	(Laughter)
429.58	In a rendering by Barry Blitt here,
432.3	Eustace has become
432.3	Eustace Vladimirovich Tilley.
437.54	And the butterfly is none other
437.54	than a flabbergasted Donald Trump
442.66	flapping his wings,
443.9	trying to figure out
443.9	how to control the butterfly effect,
447.98	and the famed logo
447.98	that was drawn by Rae Irvin in 1925
453.58	is now in Cyrillic.
455.74	So, what makes me really excited
455.74	about this moment
460.02	is the way that ...
463.82	You know, free press
463.82	is essential to our democracy.
468.58	And we can see from
468.58	the sublime to the ridiculous
472.26	that artists can capture what is going on
476.7	in a way that an artist
479.34	armed with just India ink and watercolor
484.5	can capture and enter
484.5	into the cultural dialogue.
490.5	It puts those artists
490.5	at the center of that culture,
495.5	and that's exactly
495.5	where I think they should be.
498.34	Because the main thing we need
498.34	right now is a good cartoon.
502.22	Thank you.
503.46	(Applause)
