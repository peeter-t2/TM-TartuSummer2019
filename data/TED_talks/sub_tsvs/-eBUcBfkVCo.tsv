15.952	"""I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,"
19.838	and Mourners to and fro
22.24	kept treading -- treading --
22.24	till [it seemed]
25.067	that Sense was breaking through --
27.836	And when they all were seated,
29.605	a Service, like a Drum --
31.603	kept beating -- beating --
31.603	till I [thought]
35.079	my Mind was going numb --
37.831	And then I heard them lift a Box
37.831	and creak across my Soul
41.994	with those same Boots of Lead, again,
45.053	then Space -- began to toll,
48.07	As [all] the Heavens were a Bell,
48.07	and Being, [but] an Ear,
52.201	and I, and Silence, some strange Race,
55.284	wrecked, solitary, here --
58.493	[And] then a Plank in Reason, broke,
61.67	and I fell down and down --
65.011	and hit a World, at every plunge,
67.686	"and Finished knowing -- then --"""
72.198	We know depression through metaphors.
75.68	Emily Dickinson was able
75.68	to convey it in language,
79.389	Goya in an image.
82.238	Half the purpose of art
82.238	is to describe such iconic states.
87.997	As for me, I had always
87.997	thought myself tough,
91.875	one of the people who could survive
93.701	if I'd been sent to a concentration camp.
96.614	In 1991, I had a series of losses.
99.676	My mother died,
101.198	a relationship I'd been in ended,
103.324	I moved back to the United States
103.324	from some years abroad,
107.268	and I got through all of those
107.268	experiences intact.
110.617	But in 1994, three years later,
113.54	I found myself losing interest
113.54	in almost everything.
118.059	I didn't want to do any of the things
118.059	I had previously wanted to do,
121.959	and I didn't know why.
123.987	The opposite of depression
123.987	is not happiness, but vitality.
129.127	And it was vitality
130.595	that seemed to seep away
130.595	from me in that moment.
134.231	Everything there was to do
134.231	seemed like too much work.
138.597	I would come home
140.058	and I would see the red light
140.058	flashing on my answering machine,
143.41	and instead of being thrilled
143.41	to hear from my friends,
145.974	I would think,
147.187	"""What a lot of people that is"
147.187	"to have to call back."""
150.368	Or I would decide I should have lunch,
152.954	and then I would think,
152.954	but I'd have to get the food out
155.715	and put it on a plate
157.501	and cut it up and chew it and swallow it,
161.389	and it felt to me
161.389	like the Stations of the Cross.
165.286	And one of the things that often gets lost
165.286	in discussions of depression
169.443	is that you know it's ridiculous.
171.801	You know it's ridiculous
171.801	while you're experiencing it.
174.768	You know that most people manage
176.681	to listen to their messages and eat lunch
178.995	and organize themselves to take a shower
180.925	and go out the front door
182.167	and that it's not a big deal,
183.819	and yet you are nonetheless in its grip
186.985	and you are unable to figure out
186.985	any way around it.
190.99	And so I began to feel myself doing less
195.236	and thinking less
197.546	and feeling less.
199.829	It was a kind of nullity.
202.049	And then the anxiety set in.
204.567	If you told me that I'd have to be
204.567	depressed for the next month,
208.283	"I would say, ""As long I know it'll be over"
208.283	"in November, I can do it."""
211.546	But if you said to me,
212.816	"""You have to have acute anxiety"
212.816	"for the next month,"""
216.153	I would rather slit my wrist
216.153	than go through it.
218.496	It was the feeling all the time
220.078	like that feeling you have
220.078	if you're walking
222.306	and you slip or trip
222.306	and the ground is rushing up at you,
225.851	but instead of lasting half a second,
225.851	the way that does,
228.587	it lasted for six months.
230.492	It's a sensation
230.492	of being afraid all the time
233.445	but not even knowing
233.445	what it is that you're afraid of.
237.057	And it was at that point
237.057	that I began to think
239.692	that it was just too painful to be alive,
243.476	and that the only reason
243.476	not to kill oneself
246.06	was so as not to hurt other people.
249.295	And finally one day, I woke up
252.2	and I thought perhaps I'd had a stroke,
254.421	because I lay in bed completely frozen,
256.939	looking at the telephone, thinking,
258.888	"""Something is wrong"
258.888	"and I should call for help,"""
262.451	and I couldn't reach out my arm
264.186	and pick up the phone and dial.
266.801	And finally, after four full hours
266.801	of my lying and staring at it,
270.876	the phone rang,
272.164	and somehow I managed to pick it up,
274.567	and it was my father, and I said,
277.519	"""I'm in serious trouble."
277.519	"We need to do something."""
281.528	The next day I started
281.528	with the medications and the therapy.
287.352	And I also started reckoning
287.352	with this terrible question:
291.579	If I'm not the tough person
293.707	who could have made it
293.707	through a concentration camp,
296.231	then who am I?
297.743	And if I have to take medication,
299.628	is that medication making me
299.628	more fully myself,
303.565	or is it making me someone else?
305.807	And how do I feel about it
305.807	if it's making me someone else?
310.101	I had two advantages
310.101	as I went into the fight.
313.585	The first is that I knew that,
313.585	objectively speaking,
316.28	I had a nice life,
317.901	and that if I could only get well,
319.786	there was something at the other end
319.786	that was worth living for.
323.01	And the other was
323.01	that I had access to good treatment.
326.343	But I nonetheless emerged and relapsed,
329.816	and emerged and relapsed,
332.351	and emerged and relapsed,
335.369	and finally understood
337.333	I would have to be on medication
337.333	and in therapy forever.
341.769	And I thought,
342.96	"""But is it a chemical problem"
342.96	or a psychological problem?
345.77	And does it need a chemical cure
345.77	"or a philosophical cure?"""
349.727	And I couldn't figure out which it was.
351.878	And then I understood that actually,
354.002	we aren't advanced enough in either area
354.002	for it to explain things fully.
358.013	The chemical cure
358.013	and the psychological cure
361.364	both have a role to play,
363.062	and I also figured out
363.062	that depression was something
367.06	that was braided so deep into us
369.308	that there was no separating it
369.308	from our character and personality.
373.552	I want to say that the treatments we have
373.552	for depression are appalling.
378.038	They're not very effective.
379.958	They're extremely costly.
381.752	They come with innumerable side effects.
384.273	They're a disaster.
386.027	But I am so grateful that I live now
386.027	and not 50 years ago,
390.718	when there would have been
390.718	almost nothing to be done.
393.662	I hope that 50 years hence,
396.069	people will hear about my treatments
398.115	and be appalled that anyone endured
398.115	such primitive science.
402.885	Depression is the flaw in love.
407.441	If you were married
407.441	to someone and thought,
410.582	"""Well, if my wife dies,"
410.582	"I'll find another one,"""
414.316	it wouldn't be love as we know it.
417.364	There's no such thing as love
417.364	without the anticipation of loss,
421.955	and that specter of despair
421.955	can be the engine of intimacy.
428.204	There are three things
428.204	people tend to confuse:
431.059	depression, grief and sadness.
434.966	Grief is explicitly reactive.
438.329	If you have a loss
438.329	and you feel incredibly unhappy,
441.234	and then, six months later,
442.933	you are still deeply sad,
442.933	but you're functioning a little better,
446.042	it's probably grief,
447.851	and it will probably ultimately
447.851	resolve itself in some measure.
451.61	If you experience a catastrophic loss,
454.439	and you feel terrible,
455.765	and six months later
455.765	you can barely function at all,
458.578	then it's probably a depression
458.578	that was triggered
461.116	by the catastrophic circumstances.
463.648	The trajectory tells us a great deal.
467.196	People think of depression
467.196	as being just sadness.
470.58	It's much, much too much sadness,
472.775	much too much grief
474.55	at far too slight a cause.
477.47	As I set out to understand depression,
480.279	and to interview people
480.279	who had experienced it,
482.95	I found that there were people
482.95	who seemed, on the surface,
486.767	to have what sounded like
486.767	relatively mild depression
490.004	who were nonetheless
490.004	utterly disabled by it.
493.297	And there were other people
493.297	who had what sounded
495.734	as they described it
495.734	like terribly severe depression
498.82	who nonetheless had good lives
500.584	in the interstices
500.584	between their depressive episodes.
503.885	And I set out to find out
503.885	what it is that causes some people
507.874	to be more resilient than other people.
510.127	What are the mechanisms
510.127	that allow people to survive?
513.652	And I went out and I interviewed
513.652	person after person
516.874	who was suffering with depression.
518.874	One of the first people I interviewed
521.089	described depression
521.089	as a slower way of being dead,
525.967	and that was a good thing
525.967	for me to hear early on
528.325	because it reminded me
528.325	that that slow way of being dead
531.456	can lead to actual deadness,
533.76	that this is a serious business.
535.741	It's the leading disability worldwide,
538.154	and people die of it every day.
541.184	One of the people I talked to
541.184	when I was trying to understand this
544.927	was a beloved friend
544.927	who I had known for many years,
548.812	and who had had a psychotic episode
548.812	in her freshman year of college,
553.289	and then plummeted
553.289	into a horrific depression.
556.115	She had bipolar illness,
557.778	or manic depression, as it was then known.
560.289	And then she did very well
560.289	for many years on lithium,
564.098	and then eventually,
564.098	she was taken off her lithium
567.271	to see how she would do without it,
569.106	and she had another psychosis,
571.081	and then plunged into the worst depression
571.081	that I had ever seen
575.465	in which she sat
575.465	in her parents' apartment,
578.306	more or less catatonic,
578.306	essentially without moving,
581.602	day after day after day.
583.943	And when I interviewed her
583.943	about that experience some years later --
587.451	she's a poet and psychotherapist
587.451	named Maggie Robbins --
590.576	when I interviewed her, she said,
593.646	"""I was singing 'Where Have"
593.646	All The Flowers Gone,'
597.189	over and over, to occupy my mind.
600.555	I was singing to blot out
600.555	the things my mind was saying,
603.375	which were, 'You are nothing.
603.375	You are nobody.
608.159	You don't even deserve to live.'
610.691	And that was
610.691	when I really started thinking
613.121	"about killing myself."""
615.193	You don't think in depression
615.193	that you've put on a gray veil
619.127	and are seeing the world
619.127	through the haze of a bad mood.
623.001	You think that the veil
623.001	has been taken away,
626.015	the veil of happiness,
627.643	and that now you're seeing truly.
630.247	It's easier to help
630.247	schizophrenics who perceive
633.031	that there's something foreign
633.031	inside of them that needs to be exorcised,
637.029	but it's difficult with depressives,
639.379	because we believe
639.379	we are seeing the truth.
643.04	But the truth lies.
645.987	I became obsessed with that sentence:
647.985	"""But the truth lies."""
650.435	And I discovered,
650.435	as I talked to depressive people,
652.899	that they have
652.899	many delusional perceptions.
655.815	"People will say, ""No one loves me."""
657.577	"And you say, ""I love you,"
658.813	your wife loves you,
658.813	"your mother loves you."""
661.335	You can answer that one pretty readily,
661.335	at least for most people.
665.124	But people who are depressed
665.124	will also say,
667.314	"""No matter what we do,"
667.314	"we're all just going to die in the end."""
671.385	Or they'll say,
671.385	"""There can be no true communion"
673.638	between two human beings.
675.024	"Each of us is trapped in his own body."""
677.805	To which you have to say,
679.449	"""That's true,"
680.952	but I think we should focus right now
680.952	"on what to have for breakfast."""
684.484	(Laughter)
686.669	A lot of the time,
688.338	what they are expressing
688.338	is not illness, but insight,
691.336	and one comes to think
691.336	what's really extraordinary
693.891	is that most of us know
693.891	about those existential questions
697.047	and they don't distract us very much.
699.428	There was a study I particularly liked
701.274	in which a group of depressed
701.274	and a group of non-depressed people
705.041	were asked to play a video
705.041	game for an hour,
707.789	and at the end of the hour,
709.433	they were asked how many little monsters
709.433	they thought they had killed.
713.067	The depressive group was usually accurate
713.067	to within about 10 percent,
717.076	and the non-depressed people
718.671	guessed between 15 and 20 times
718.671	as many little monsters --
723.149	(Laughter)
724.324	as they had actually killed.
727.945	A lot of people said, when I chose
727.945	to write about my depression,
731.185	that it must be very difficult
731.185	to be out of that closet,
734.674	to have people know.
736.007	"They said, ""Do people"
736.007	"talk to you differently?"""
738.3	"I said, ""Yes, people"
738.3	talk to me differently.
740.403	They talk to me differently insofar
742.189	as they start telling me
742.189	about their experience,
744.88	or their sister's experience,
746.715	or their friend's experience.
748.729	Things are different because now I know
750.951	that depression is the family secret
750.951	that everyone has.
755.715	I went a few years ago to a conference,
759.365	and on Friday of the three-day conference,
761.82	one of the participants
761.82	took me aside, and she said,
764.849	"""I suffer from depression"
764.849	and I'm a little embarrassed about it,
771.122	but I've been taking this medication,
772.988	and I just wanted to ask you
772.988	"what you think?"""
776.126	And so I did my best to give her
776.126	such advice as I could.
778.77	"And then she said, ""You know,"
778.77	my husband would never understand this.
783.281	He's really the kind of guy to whom
783.281	this wouldn't make any sense,
786.573	"so, you know, it's just between us."""
788.721	"And I said, ""Yes, that's fine."""
790.733	On Sunday of the same conference,
792.616	her husband took me aside,
794.516	(Laughter)
795.854	"and he said, ""My wife wouldn't think"
797.639	that I was really much
797.639	of a guy if she knew this,
799.974	but I've been dealing with this depression
799.974	and I'm taking some medication,
803.756	"and I wondered what you think?"""
806.205	They were hiding the same medication
808.519	in two different places
808.519	in the same bedroom.
811.918	(Laughter)
813.14	And I said that I thought
813.14	communication within the marriage
816.102	might be triggering
816.102	some of their problems.
818.174	(Laughter)
822.593	But I was also struck
824.18	by the burdensome nature
824.18	of such mutual secrecy.
828.141	Depression is so exhausting.
830.026	It takes up so much
830.026	of your time and energy,
832.996	and silence about it,
834.551	it really does make the depression worse.
837.276	And then I began thinking
838.509	about all the ways
838.509	people make themselves better.
840.856	I'd started off as a medical conservative.
843.341	I thought there were a few
843.341	kinds of therapy that worked,
845.999	it was clear what they were --
847.468	there was medication,
848.992	there were certain psychotherapies,
850.683	there was possibly
850.683	electroconvulsive treatment,
853.128	and that everything else was nonsense.
855.741	But then I discovered something.
857.693	If you have brain cancer,
859.35	and you say that standing on your head
859.35	for 20 minutes every morning
862.562	makes you feel better,
863.739	it may make you feel better,
863.739	but you still have brain cancer,
866.741	and you'll still probably die from it.
869.387	But if you say that you have depression,
871.697	and standing on your head
871.697	for 20 minutes every day
874.061	makes you feel better, then it's worked,
876.281	because depression
876.281	is an illness of how you feel,
878.746	and if you feel better,
880.1	then you are effectively
880.1	not depressed anymore.
883.112	So I became much more tolerant
885.223	of the vast world
885.223	of alternative treatments.
887.936	And I get letters,
887.936	I get hundreds of letters
890.272	from people writing to tell me
890.272	about what's worked for them.
893.106	Someone was asking me
893.106	backstage today about meditation.
896.695	My favorite of the letters that I got
896.695	was the one that came from a woman
900.391	who wrote and said
900.391	that she had tried therapy, medication,
903.336	she had tried pretty much everything,
905.19	and she had found a solution
905.19	and hoped I would tell the world,
908.12	and that was making
908.12	little things from yarn.
911.716	(Laughter)
914.633	She sent me some of them.
916.193	(Laughter)
918.247	And I'm not wearing them right now.
920.136	(Laughter)
921.845	I suggested to her
921.845	that she also should look up
924.36	obsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM.
928.979	And yet, when I went to look
928.979	at alternative treatments,
931.693	I also gained perspective
931.693	on other treatments.
934.605	I went through
934.605	a tribal exorcism in Senegal
937.347	that involved a great deal of ram's blood
939.36	and that I'm not going
939.36	to detail right now,
941.422	but a few years afterwards
941.422	I was in Rwanda,
943.446	working on a different project,
945.367	and I happened to describe
945.367	my experience to someone,
947.976	and he said,
949.159	"""Well, that's West Africa,"
949.159	and we're in East Africa,
951.641	and our rituals are
951.641	in some ways very different,
953.922	but we do have some rituals
955.247	that have something in common
955.247	"with what you're describing."""
958.071	And he said,
959.262	"""But we've had a lot of trouble"
959.262	with Western mental health workers,
962.497	especially the ones who came
962.497	"right after the genocide."""
965.139	"I said, ""What kind"
965.139	"of trouble did you have?"""
967.213	"And he said, ""Well,"
967.213	they would do this bizarre thing.
970.989	They didn't take people out
970.989	in the sunshine
973.061	where you begin to feel better.
974.574	They didn't include drumming
974.574	or music to get people's blood going.
977.75	They didn't involve the whole community.
979.68	They didn't externalize
979.68	the depression as an invasive spirit.
982.94	Instead what they did was they took people
982.94	one at a time into dingy little rooms
987.977	and had them talk for an hour
989.382	about bad things
989.382	"that had happened to them."""
991.55	(Laughter)
993.617	(Applause)
997.01	"He said, ""We had to ask them"
997.01	"to leave the country."""
999.463	(Laughter)
1002.429	Now at the other end
1002.429	of alternative treatments,
1005.031	let me tell you about Frank Russakoff.
1007.15	Frank Russakoff had the worst depression
1007.15	perhaps that I've ever seen in a man.
1012.876	He was constantly depressed.
1014.869	He was, when I met him,
1016.338	at a point at which every month,
1016.338	he would have electroshock treatment.
1020.168	Then he would feel
1020.168	sort of disoriented for a week.
1022.743	Then he would feel okay for a week.
1024.546	Then he would have a week
1024.546	of going downhill.
1026.664	And then he would have another
1026.664	electroshock treatment.
1029.278	And he said to me when I met him,
1030.875	"""It's unbearable to go"
1030.875	through my weeks this way.
1033.264	I can't go on this way,
1034.735	and I've figured out
1034.735	how I'm going to end it
1036.869	"if I don't get better."""
1038.226	"""But,"" he said to me,"
1038.226	"""I heard about a protocol at Mass General"
1042.352	for a procedure called a cingulotomy,
1042.352	which is a brain surgery,
1045.598	"and I think I'm going to give that a try."""
1047.891	And I remember being amazed
1047.891	at that point to think that someone
1051.208	who clearly had so many bad experiences
1054.229	with so many different treatments
1056.389	still had buried in him,
1056.389	somewhere, enough optimism
1059.453	to reach out for one more.
1061.76	And he had the cingulotomy,
1061.76	and it was incredibly successful.
1065.981	He's now a friend of mine.
1067.617	He has a lovely wife
1067.617	and two beautiful children.
1070.966	He wrote me a letter
1070.966	the Christmas after the surgery,
1073.915	and he said,
1075.104	"""My father sent me two presents this year,"
1077.731	First, a motorized CD rack
1077.731	from The Sharper Image
1080.282	that I didn't really need,
1081.704	but I knew he was giving it
1081.704	to me to celebrate
1083.965	the fact that I'm living on my own
1083.965	and have a job I seem to love.
1087.635	And the other present
1087.635	was a photo of my grandmother,
1090.9	who committed suicide.
1092.955	As I unwrapped it, I began to cry,
1095.884	and my mother came over and said,
1097.765	'Are you crying because
1097.765	of the relatives you never knew?'
1101.162	And I said, 'She had
1101.162	the same disease I have.'
1105.242	I'm crying now as I write to you.
1107.878	It's not that I'm so sad,
1107.878	but I get overwhelmed,
1111.189	I think, because I could
1111.189	have killed myself,
1113.41	but my parents kept me going,
1113.41	and so did the doctors,
1116.862	and I had the surgery.
1118.716	I'm alive and grateful.
1121.531	We live in the right time,
1121.531	"even if it doesn't always feel like it."""
1127.856	I was struck by the fact that depression
1129.799	is broadly perceived to be
1129.799	a modern, Western, middle-class thing,
1134.829	and I went to look at how it operated
1134.829	in a variety of other contexts,
1138.984	and one of the things
1138.984	I was most interested in
1141.199	was depression among the indigent.
1143.138	And so I went out to try to look
1144.71	at what was being done
1144.71	for poor people with depression.
1147.487	And what I discovered is that poor people
1149.638	are mostly not being
1149.638	treated for depression.
1152.19	Depression is the result
1152.19	of a genetic vulnerability,
1154.888	which is presumably
1154.888	evenly distributed in the population,
1158.262	and triggering circumstances,
1159.999	which are likely to be more severe
1159.999	for people who are impoverished.
1163.777	And yet it turns out that if you have
1163.777	a really lovely life
1167.304	but feel miserable all the time,
1168.91	"you think, ""Why do I feel like this?"
1170.72	"I must have depression."""
1172.013	And you set out to find treatment for it.
1174.173	But if you have a perfectly awful life,
1176.129	and you feel miserable all the time,
1177.896	the way you feel
1177.896	is commensurate with your life,
1180.93	and it doesn't occur to you to think,
1182.809	"""Maybe this is treatable."""
1184.37	And so we have an epidemic in this country
1187.596	of depression among impoverished people
1190.278	that's not being picked up
1190.278	and that's not being treated
1192.874	and that's not being addressed,
1194.846	and it's a tragedy of a grand order.
1197.219	And so I found an academic
1198.843	who was doing a research project
1198.843	in slums outside of D.C.,
1202.092	where she picked up women
1202.092	who had come in for other health problems
1205.259	and diagnosed them with depression,
1207.038	and then provided six months
1207.038	of the experimental protocol.
1210.134	One of them, Lolly, came in,
1212.463	and this is what she said
1212.463	the day she came in.
1215.069	She said, and she was a woman,
1215.069	by the way, who had seven children.
1219.658	"She said, ""I used to have a job"
1219.658	but I had to give it up
1222.467	because I couldn't go out of the house.
1225.134	I have nothing to say to my children.
1227.447	In the morning,
1227.447	I can't wait for them to leave,
1229.953	and then I climb in bed
1229.953	and pull the covers over my head,
1233.179	and three o'clock when they come home,
1235.078	"it just comes so fast."""
1236.544	"She said, ""I've been taking"
1236.544	a lot of Tylenol,
1238.862	anything I can take
1238.862	so that I can sleep more.
1241.389	My husband has been telling me
1241.389	I'm stupid, I'm ugly.
1245.41	"I wish I could stop the pain."""
1248.935	Well, she was brought
1248.935	into this experimental protocol,
1251.555	and when I interviewed her
1251.555	six months later,
1253.77	she had taken a job working in childcare
1258.019	for the U.S. Navy,
1258.019	she had left the abusive husband,
1262.093	and she said to me,
1264.14	"""My kids are so much happier now."""
1266.419	"She said, ""There's one room"
1266.419	in my new place for the boys
1269.125	and one room for the girls,
1271.036	but at night, they're just
1271.036	all up on my bed,
1273.399	and we're doing homework
1273.399	all together and everything.
1276.011	One of them wants to be a preacher,
1277.709	one of them wants to be a firefighter,
1279.626	and one of the girls says
1279.626	she's going to be a lawyer.
1282.35	They don't cry like they used to,
1284.578	and they don't fight like they did.
1287.144	That's all I need now, is my kids.
1290.826	Things keep on changing,
1292.795	the way I dress,
1292.795	the way I feel, the way I act.
1297.909	I can go outside not being afraid anymore,
1301.734	and I don't think
1301.734	those bad feelings are coming back,
1305.246	and if it weren't
1305.246	for Dr. Miranda and that,
1308.206	I would still be at home
1308.206	with the covers pulled over my head,
1311.752	if I were still alive at all.
1314.097	I asked the Lord to send me an angel,
1317.627	"and He heard my prayers."""
1322.308	I was really moved by these experiences,
1325.312	and I decided that I wanted
1325.312	to write about them
1327.851	not only in a book I was working on,
1327.851	but also in an article,
1330.692	and I got a commission
1330.692	from The New York Times Magazine
1333.295	to write about depression
1333.295	among the indigent.
1335.438	And I turned in my story,
1336.699	and my editor called me and said,
1336.699	"""We really can't publish this."""
1340.668	"And I said, ""Why not?"""
1341.851	"And she said, ""It just is too far-fetched."
1343.946	These people who are sort of
1343.946	at the very bottom rung of society
1347.633	and then they get
1347.633	a few months of treatment
1349.672	and they're virtually ready
1349.672	to run Morgan Stanley?
1352.069	"It's just too implausible."""
1354.013	"She said, ""I've never even heard"
1354.013	"of anything like it."""
1356.618	"And I said, ""The fact"
1356.618	that you've never heard of it
1359.095	"is an indication that it is news."""
1361.907	(Laughter)
1365.954	(Applause)
1369.317	"""And you are a news magazine."""
1371.95	So after a certain amount of negotiation,
1371.95	they agreed to it.
1375.034	But I think a lot of what they said
1375.034	was connected in some strange way
1378.944	to this distaste that people still have
1378.944	for the idea of treatment,
1382.549	the notion that somehow if we went out
1384.431	and treated a lot of people
1384.431	in indigent communities,
1387.278	that would be exploitative,
1389.158	because we would be changing them.
1390.88	There is this false moral imperative
1390.88	that seems to be all around us,
1394.711	that treatment of depression,
1396.843	the medications and so on,
1396.843	are an artifice,
1399.142	and that it's not natural.
1401.489	And I think that's very misguided.
1404.456	It would be natural
1404.456	for people's teeth to fall out,
1407.813	but there is nobody militating
1407.813	against toothpaste,
1411.025	at least not in my circles.
1413.915	People then say,
1415.183	"""But isn't depression part of what people"
1415.183	are supposed to experience?
1418.468	Didn't we evolve to have depression?
1420.224	"Isn't it part of your personality?"""
1421.999	To which I would say, mood is adaptive.
1424.462	Being able to have sadness and fear
1427.563	and joy and pleasure
1429.493	and all of the other moods that we have,
1429.493	that's incredibly valuable.
1433.272	And major depression
1435.21	is something that happens
1435.21	when that system gets broken.
1438.596	It's maladaptive.
1440.224	People will come to me and say,
1441.863	"""I think, though, if I just"
1441.863	stick it out for another year,
1444.689	"I think I can just get through this."""
1446.566	And I always say to them,
1446.566	"""You may get through it,"
1449.114	but you'll never be 37 again.
1451.733	Life is short, and that's a whole year
1451.733	you're talking about giving up.
1455.982	"Think it through."""
1457.694	It's a strange poverty
1457.694	of the English language,
1460.366	and indeed of many other languages,
1462.474	that we use this same word, depression,
1464.868	to describe how a kid feels
1464.868	when it rains on his birthday,
1468.606	and to describe how somebody feels
1468.606	the minute before they commit suicide.
1473.495	"People say to me, ""Well, is it"
1473.495	"continuous with normal sadness?"""
1476.525	And I say, in a way it's continuous
1476.525	with normal sadness.
1479.656	There is a certain amount of continuity,
1481.854	but it's the same way there's continuity
1483.815	between having an iron fence
1483.815	outside your house
1486.045	that gets a little rust spot
1487.489	that you have to sand off
1487.489	and do a little repainting,
1490.111	and what happens if you leave
1490.111	the house for 100 years
1492.963	and it rusts through
1492.963	until it's only a pile of orange dust.
1497.082	And it's that orange dust spot,
1498.959	that orange dust problem,
1500.748	that's the one
1500.748	we're setting out to address.
1504.04	So now people say,
1506.278	"""You take these happy pills,"
1506.278	"and do you feel happy?"""
1508.981	And I don't.
1510.594	But I don't feel sad
1510.594	about having to eat lunch,
1513.586	and I don't feel sad
1513.586	about my answering machine,
1516.451	and I don't feel sad
1516.451	about taking a shower.
1519.324	I feel more, in fact, I think,
1521.951	because I can feel
1521.951	sadness without nullity.
1524.704	I feel sad about professional
1524.704	disappointments,
1528.934	about damaged relationships,
1531.242	about global warming.
1533.114	Those are the things
1533.114	that I feel sad about now.
1535.839	And I said to myself, well,
1535.839	what is the conclusion?
1538.573	How did those people who have better lives
1541.134	even with bigger depression
1541.134	manage to get through?
1543.964	What is the mechanism of resilience?
1546.583	And what I came up with over time
1548.569	was that the people
1548.569	who deny their experience,
1551.419	"and say, ""I was depressed a long time ago,"
1553.459	I never want to think about it again,
1555.254	I'm not going to look at it
1556.572	and I'm just going
1556.572	"to get on with my life,"""
1558.619	ironically, those are the people
1558.619	who are most enslaved by what they have.
1563.241	Shutting out the depression
1563.241	strengthens it.
1565.78	While you hide from it, it grows.
1569.185	And the people who do better
1571.747	are the ones who are able to tolerate
1571.747	the fact that they have this condition.
1576.324	Those who can tolerate their depression
1576.324	are the ones who achieve resilience.
1580.516	So Frank Russakoff said to me,
1582.152	"""If I had a do-over,"
1582.152	I suppose I wouldn't do it this way,
1585.898	but in a strange way,
1585.898	I'm grateful for what I've experienced.
1589.39	I'm glad to have been
1589.39	in the hospital 40 times.
1593.023	It taught me so much about love,
1595.658	and my relationship
1595.658	with my parents and my doctors
1598.603	has been so precious to me,
1598.603	"and will be always."""
1602.772	And Maggie Robbins said,
1604.698	"""I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic,"
1607.687	and I would just talk and talk and talk,
1610.701	and the people I was dealing with
1610.701	weren't very responsive, and I thought,
1614.758	'That's not very friendly
1614.758	"or helpful of them.'"""
1617.278	(Laughter)
1618.542	"""And then I realized,"
1620.184	I realized that
1620.184	they weren't going to do more
1622.351	than make those first
1622.351	few minutes of small talk.
1624.858	It was simply going to be an occasion
1626.921	where I didn't have AIDS
1626.921	and I wasn't dying,
1629.894	but could tolerate the fact that they did
1632.796	and they were.
1634.503	Our needs are our greatest assets.
1638.202	It turns out I've learned to give
1638.202	"all the things I need."""
1644.16	Valuing one's depression
1644.16	does not prevent a relapse,
1648.045	but it may make the prospect of relapse
1650.706	and even relapse itself
1650.706	easier to tolerate.
1655.004	The question is not so much
1655.004	of finding great meaning
1658.686	and deciding your depression
1658.686	has been very meaningful.
1661.281	It's of seeking that meaning
1661.281	and thinking, when it comes again,
1665.296	"""This will be hellish,"
1665.296	"but I will learn something from it."""
1669.487	I have learned in my own depression
1671.751	how big an emotion can be,
1673.973	how it can be more real than facts,
1677.057	and I have found that that experience
1679.81	has allowed me to experience
1679.81	positive emotion
1682.702	in a more intense and more focused way.
1686.222	The opposite of depression
1686.222	is not happiness,
1689.829	but vitality,
1691.163	and these days, my life is vital,
1694.142	even on the days when I'm sad.
1696.823	I felt that funeral in my brain,
1699.962	and I sat next to the colossus
1699.962	at the edge of the world,
1704.526	and I have discovered
1704.526	something inside of myself
1708.437	that I would have to call a soul
1710.525	that I had never formulated
1710.525	until that day 20 years ago
1714.062	when hell came to pay me a surprise visit.
1718.841	I think that while I hated being depressed
1722.678	and would hate to be depressed again,
1725.204	I've found a way to love my depression.
1727.894	I love it because it has forced me
1727.894	to find and cling to joy.
1732.681	I love it because each day I decide,
1736.294	sometimes gamely,
1737.707	and sometimes against the moment's reason,
1740.276	to cleave to the reasons for living.
1742.978	And that, I think,
1742.978	is a highly privileged rapture.
1747.076	Thank you.
1748.356	(Applause)
1752.381	Thank you.
