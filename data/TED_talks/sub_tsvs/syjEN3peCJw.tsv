12.934	The day I left home for the first time
14.791	to go to university was a bright day
16.971	brimming with hope and optimism.
19.516	I'd done well at school.
19.516	Expectations for me were high,
22.463	and I gleefully entered the student life
24.638	of lectures, parties
24.638	and traffic cone theft.
28.236	Now appearances, of course,
28.236	can be deceptive,
30.914	and to an extent, this
30.914	feisty, energetic persona
34.029	of lecture-going and traffic
34.029	cone stealing was a veneer,
37.184	albeit a very well-crafted
37.184	and convincing one.
40.223	Underneath, I was actually
40.223	deeply unhappy, insecure
43.649	and fundamentally frightened --
45.863	frightened of other people,
45.863	of the future, of failure
49.486	and of the emptiness
49.486	that I felt was within me.
51.839	But I was skilled at hiding
51.839	it, and from the outside
54.34	appeared to be someone
54.34	with everything to hope for
56.745	and aspire to.
57.996	This fantasy of invulnerability
57.996	was so complete
61.202	that I even deceived myself,
62.914	and as the first semester
62.914	ended and the second began,
65.462	there was no way that anyone
65.462	could have predicted
67.994	what was just about to happen.
70.617	I was leaving a seminar when it started,
73.75	humming to myself, fumbling with my bag
75.911	just as I'd done a hundred times before,
78.334	when suddenly I heard
78.334	a voice calmly observe,
80.81	"""She is leaving the room."""
83.002	I looked around, and there
83.002	was no one there,
84.417	but the clarity
84.417	and decisiveness of the comment
87.091	was unmistakable.
88.935	Shaken, I left my books
88.935	on the stairs and hurried home,
91.579	and there it was again.
92.818	"""She is opening the door."""
94.881	This was the beginning.
94.881	The voice had arrived.
98.853	And the voice persisted,
101.1	days and then weeks of it, on and on,
103.565	narrating everything I did
103.565	in the third person.
105.828	"""She is going to the library."""
107.486	"""She is going to a lecture."""
109.081	It was neutral, impassive
109.081	and even, after a while,
112.417	strangely companionate and reassuring,
114.999	although I did notice that its
114.999	calm exterior sometimes slipped
118.44	and that it occasionally mirrored
118.44	my own unexpressed emotion.
121.541	So, for example, if I was angry
121.541	and had to hide it,
124.153	which I often did, being very adept
124.153	at concealing how I really felt,
127.519	then the voice would sound frustrated.
129.856	Otherwise, it was neither
129.856	sinister nor disturbing,
132.669	although even at that point it was clear
134.779	that it had something to communicate to me
136.803	about my emotions, particularly emotions
139.174	which were remote and inaccessible.
142.259	Now it was then that I made
142.259	a fatal mistake,
145.383	in that I told a friend
145.383	about the voice, and she was horrified.
148.586	A subtle conditioning process had begun,
150.831	the implication that normal
150.831	people don't hear voices
154.52	and the fact that I did meant
154.52	that something was very seriously wrong.
157.878	Such fear and mistrust was infectious.
161.266	Suddenly the voice didn't
161.266	seem quite so benign anymore,
164.331	and when she insisted
164.331	that I seek medical attention,
166.832	I duly complied, and which proved to be
168.903	mistake number two.
170.65	I spent some time telling the college G.P.
172.796	about what I perceived
172.796	to be the real problem:
175.011	anxiety, low self-worth,
175.011	fears about the future,
177.867	and was met with bored indifference
179.64	until I mentioned the voice,
181.434	upon which he dropped his pen, swung round
183.458	and began to question me
183.458	with a show of real interest.
186.169	And to be fair, I was desperate
186.169	for interest and help,
188.813	and I began to tell him
188.813	about my strange commentator.
191.659	And I always wish, at this
191.659	point, the voice had said,
194.207	"""She is digging her own grave."""
195.899	I was referred
195.899	to a psychiatrist, who likewise
199.424	took a grim view of the voice's presence,
201.981	subsequently interpreting
201.981	everything I said
204.053	through a lens of latent insanity.
206.389	For example, I was part
206.389	of a student TV station
209.322	that broadcast news bulletins
209.322	around the campus,
211.874	and during an appointment
211.874	which was running very late,
213.924	"I said, ""I'm sorry,"
213.924	doctor, I've got to go.
215.173	"I'm reading the news at six."""
216.691	Now it's down on my medical
216.691	records that Eleanor
219.001	has delusions that she's a television
219.001	news broadcaster.
222.175	It was at this point that events began
225.624	to rapidly overtake me.
227.854	A hospital admission
227.854	followed, the first of many,
230.25	a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next,
233.162	and then, worst of all,
233.162	a toxic, tormenting sense
236.77	of hopelessness, humiliation and despair
240.148	about myself and my prospects.
242.683	But having been encouraged
242.683	to see the voice
245.116	not as an experience but as a symptom,
247.672	my fear and resistance
247.672	towards it intensified.
250.768	Now essentially, this represented taking
252.852	an aggressive stance towards my own mind,
254.904	a kind of psychic civil war,
257.295	and in turn this caused
257.295	the number of voices to increase
260.229	and grow progressively
260.229	hostile and menacing.
263.614	Helplessly and hopelessly,
263.614	I began to retreat
267.094	into this nightmarish inner world
269.233	in which the voices
269.233	were destined to become
271.305	both my persecutors
271.305	and my only perceived companions.
275.327	They told me, for example,
275.327	that if I proved myself worthy
278.406	of their help, then
278.406	they could change my life
280.573	back to how it had been,
281.77	and a series of increasingly
281.77	bizarre tasks was set,
284.51	a kind of labor of Hercules.
286.535	It started off quite small, for example,
288.496	pull out three strands of hair,
290.212	but gradually it grew more extreme,
291.903	culminating in commands to harm myself,
294.123	and a particularly dramatic instruction:
296.293	"""You see that tutor over there?"
298.006	You see that glass of water?
299.304	Well, you have to go over and pour it
299.304	"over him in front of the other students."""
302.102	Which I actually did,
302.102	and which needless to say
304.365	did not endear me to the faculty.
306.046	In effect, a vicious cycle
306.046	of fear, avoidance,
310.35	mistrust and misunderstanding
310.35	had been established,
313.208	and this was a battle
313.208	in which I felt powerless
315.96	and incapable of establishing
315.96	any kind of peace or reconciliation.
320.337	Two years later,
320.337	and the deterioration was dramatic.
323.995	By now, I had the whole
323.995	frenzied repertoire:
327.703	terrifying voices, grotesque visions,
330.692	bizarre, intractable delusions.
333.46	My mental health status
333.46	had been a catalyst
335.656	for discrimination, verbal abuse,
338.245	and physical and sexual assault,
340.4	and I'd been told by my psychiatrist,
342.186	"""Eleanor, you'd be better off with cancer,"
344.595	because cancer is easier
344.595	"to cure than schizophrenia."""
348.348	I'd been diagnosed, drugged and discarded,
351.74	and was by now so tormented by the voices
353.816	that I attempted to drill
353.816	a hole in my head
356.021	in order to get them out.
358.877	Now looking back on the wreckage
358.877	and despair of those years,
362.978	it seems to me now as if someone
362.978	died in that place,
366.048	and yet, someone else was saved.
369.765	A broken and haunted
369.765	person began that journey,
373.079	but the person who emerged was a survivor
376.012	and would ultimately grow into the person
378.286	I was destined to be.
380.41	Many people have harmed me in my life,
383.098	and I remember them all,
384.592	but the memories grow pale and faint
387.393	in comparison with the people
387.393	who've helped me.
391.085	The fellow survivors,
391.085	the fellow voice-hearers,
393.705	the comrades and collaborators;
395.977	the mother who never gave up on me,
398.305	who knew that one day
398.305	I would come back to her
400.913	and was willing to wait for me
400.913	for as long as it took;
404.583	the doctor who only worked
404.583	with me for a brief time
407.12	but who reinforced
407.12	his belief that recovery
409.192	was not only possible but inevitable,
411.506	and during a devastating period of relapse
413.909	told my terrified family,
413.909	"""Don't give up hope."
416.809	I believe that Eleanor
416.809	can get through this.
419.822	Sometimes, you know, it
419.822	snows as late as May,
422.66	"but summer always comes eventually."""
426.086	Fourteen minutes is not enough time
427.94	to fully credit those
427.94	good and generous people
430.876	who fought with me and for me
432.853	and who waited to welcome me back
434.652	from that agonized, lonely place.
437.151	But together, they forged
437.151	a blend of courage,
439.318	creativity, integrity,
439.318	and an unshakeable belief
442.904	that my shattered self could
442.904	become healed and whole.
446.753	I used to say that these people saved me,
448.73	but what I now know is they did something
450.1	even more important
450.1	in that they empowered me
452.671	to save myself,
454.293	and crucially, they helped
454.293	me to understand something
456.841	which I'd always suspected:
458.421	that my voices were a meaningful response
460.809	to traumatic life events,
460.809	particularly childhood events,
463.759	and as such were not my enemies
465.608	but a source of insight
465.608	into solvable emotional problems.
470.36	Now, at first, this was very
470.36	difficult to believe,
473.43	not least because the voices
473.43	appeared so hostile
475.804	and menacing, so in this
475.804	respect, a vital first step
479.15	was learning to separate
479.15	out a metaphorical meaning
481.865	from what I'd previously
481.865	interpreted to be a literal truth.
485.643	So for example, voices
485.643	which threatened to attack my home
488.793	I learned to interpret
488.793	as my own sense of fear
491.522	and insecurity in the world, rather
491.522	than an actual, objective danger.
495.18	Now at first, I would have believed them.
497.336	I remember, for example,
497.336	sitting up one night
498.908	on guard outside my parents'
498.908	room to protect them
501.378	from what I thought was a genuine
501.378	threat from the voices.
504.622	Because I'd had such a bad
504.622	problem with self-injury
507.136	that most of the cutlery
507.136	in the house had been hidden,
509.732	so I ended up arming myself
509.732	with a plastic fork,
512.226	kind of like picnic ware,
512.226	and sort of sat outside the room
515.012	clutching it and waiting to spring
515.012	into action should anything happen.
518.726	"It was like, ""Don't mess with me."
520.398	"I've got a plastic fork, don't you know?"""
523.131	Strategic.
524.611	But a later response,
524.611	and much more useful,
527.217	would be to try and deconstruct
527.217	the message behind the words,
531.635	so when the voices warned
531.635	me not to leave the house,
534.657	then I would thank them
534.657	for drawing my attention
536.733	to how unsafe I felt --
537.95	because if I was aware of it, then I could
537.95	do something positive about it --
540.843	but go on to reassure both them and myself
543.33	that we were safe and didn't
543.33	need to feel frightened anymore.
546.829	I would set boundaries for the voices,
548.318	and try to interact with them
548.318	in a way that was assertive
551.057	yet respectful,
551.057	establishing a slow process
553.313	of communication and collaboration
555.669	in which we could learn to work
555.669	together and support one another.
558.968	Throughout all of this,
558.968	what I would ultimately realize
561.612	was that each voice was closely related
563.496	to aspects of myself,
563.496	and that each of them
565.805	carried overwhelming
565.805	emotions that I'd never had
568.115	an opportunity to process or resolve,
570.193	memories of sexual trauma and abuse,
572.753	of anger, shame, guilt, low self-worth.
575.664	The voices took the place of this pain
578.164	and gave words to it,
579.651	and possibly one of the greatest
579.651	revelations
581.49	was when I realized that the most hostile
581.49	and aggressive voices
584.514	actually represented the parts of me
586.261	that had been hurt most profoundly,
588.474	and as such, it was these voices
590.626	that needed to be shown
590.626	the greatest compassion and care.
593.968	It was armed with this
593.968	knowledge that ultimately
596.983	I would gather together my shattered self,
599.271	each fragment represented
599.271	by a different voice,
601.886	gradually withdraw from all my medication,
603.937	and return to psychiatry, only this
603.937	time from the other side.
608.625	Ten years after the voice first
608.625	came, I finally graduated,
612.223	this time with the highest
612.223	degree in psychology
614.117	the university had ever
614.117	given, and one year later,
616.575	the highest masters, which shall we say
618.457	isn't bad for a madwoman.
620.18	In fact, one of the voices
620.18	actually dictated the answers
622.871	during the exam, which technically
622.871	possibly counts as cheating.
626.101	(Laughter)
627.502	And to be honest, sometimes I quite
627.502	enjoyed their attention as well.
630.236	As Oscar Wilde has said,
630.236	the only thing worse
632.403	than being talked about is not
632.403	being talked about.
634.92	It also makes you very
634.92	good at eavesdropping,
637.087	because you can listen
637.087	to two conversations simultaneously.
639.921	So it's not all bad.
641.21	I worked in mental health services,
642.901	I spoke at conferences,
645.122	I published book chapters
645.122	and academic articles,
647.432	and I argued, and continue to do so,
650.222	the relevance of the following concept:
652.466	that an important question in psychiatry
654.718	shouldn't be what's wrong with you
656.362	but rather what's happened to you.
658.966	And all the while,
658.966	I listened to my voices,
661.828	with whom I'd finally learned
661.828	to live with peace and respect
664.71	and which in turn
664.71	reflected a growing sense
666.828	of compassion, acceptance
666.828	and respect towards myself.
670.491	And I remember the most moving
670.491	and extraordinary moment
673.649	when supporting another young woman
673.649	who was terrorized by her voices,
676.959	and becoming fully aware,
676.959	for the very first time,
679.558	that I no longer felt that way myself
681.854	but was finally able to help
681.854	someone else who was.
685.578	I'm now very proud to be
685.578	a part of Intervoice,
689.146	the organizational body of the International
689.146	Hearing Voices Movement,
693.115	an initiative inspired by the work
693.115	of Professor Marius Romme
696.498	and Dr. Sandra Escher,
697.75	which locates voice hearing
697.75	as a survival strategy,
700.946	a sane reaction to insane circumstances,
704.312	not as an aberrant symptom
704.312	of schizophrenia to be endured,
707.971	but a complex, significant
707.971	and meaningful experience
711.235	to be explored.
713.559	Together, we envisage and enact a society
715.842	that understands
715.842	and respects voice hearing,
718.319	supports the needs
718.319	of individuals who hear voices,
720.724	and which values them as full citizens.
724.005	This type of society is not only possible,
726.291	it's already on its way.
728.303	To paraphrase Chavez, once
728.303	social change begins,
732.097	it cannot be reversed.
734.189	You cannot humiliate
734.189	the person who feels pride.
737.416	You cannot oppress the people
739.207	who are not afraid anymore.
741.691	For me, the achievements
741.691	of the Hearing Voices Movement
744.335	are a reminder that empathy, fellowship,
746.769	justice and respect are more than words;
749.513	they are convictions and beliefs,
752.124	and that beliefs can change the world.
754.61	In the last 20 years,
754.61	the Hearing Voices Movement
757.385	has established hearing voices networks
759.597	in 26 countries across five continents,
762.588	working together to promote
762.588	dignity, solidarity
765.957	and empowerment for individuals
765.957	in mental distress,
769.023	to create a new language
769.023	and practice of hope,
772.288	which, at its very center,
772.288	lies an unshakable belief
776.232	in the power of the individual.
779.122	As Peter Levine has said, the human animal
782.043	is a unique being
783.695	endowed with an instinctual
783.695	capacity to heal
787.069	and the intellectual spirit
787.069	to harness this innate capacity.
791.28	In this respect, for members of society,
793.764	there is no greater honor or privilege
796.257	than facilitating that process
796.257	of healing for someone,
798.917	to bear witness, to reach out a hand,
801.863	to share the burden
801.863	of someone's suffering,
804.226	and to hold the hope for their recovery.
807.3	And likewise, for survivors
807.3	of distress and adversity,
809.896	that we remember we don't
809.896	have to live our lives
812.408	forever defined by the damaging
812.408	things that have happened to us.
816.12	We are unique. We are irreplaceable.
818.629	What lies within us can
818.629	never be truly colonized,
821.346	contorted, or taken away.
823.702	The light never goes out.
827.8	As a very wonderful
827.8	doctor once said to me,
829.91	"""Don't tell me what other people"
829.91	have told you about yourself.
833.161	"Tell me about you."""
836.212	Thank you.
838.018	(Applause)
