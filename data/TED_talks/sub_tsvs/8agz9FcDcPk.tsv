15.26	It's a great honor today
17.26	to share with you
19.26	The Digital Universe,
21.26	which was created for humanity
23.26	to really see where we are
25.26	in the universe.
28.26	And so I think we can roll the video that we have.
30.26	[The Himalayas.]
33.26	(Music)
35.26	The flat horizon that we've evolved with
38.26	has been a metaphor for the
40.26	infinite: unbounded resources
42.26	and unlimited capacity
44.26	for disposal of waste.
47.26	It wasn't until we really
49.26	left Earth,
51.26	got above the atmosphere
53.26	and had seen the horizon
55.26	bend back on itself,
58.26	that we could understand our planet
60.26	as a limited condition.
64.26	The Digital Universe Atlas
69.26	has been built
71.26	at the American Museum of Natural History
74.26	over the past 12 years.
77.26	We maintain that,
79.26	put that together
81.26	as a project
83.26	to really chart the universe
85.26	across all scales.
89.26	What we see here are satellites around the Earth
92.26	and the Earth in proper registration
95.26	against the universe, as we see.
102.26	NASA supported this work
107.26	as part of the rebuilding
109.26	of the Hayden Planetarium
111.26	so that we would share this with the world.
114.26	The Digital Universe is the basis
116.26	of our space show productions that we do --
118.26	our main space shows in the dome.
121.26	But what you see here
123.26	is the result of, actually, internships
125.26	that we hosted with Linkoping University
128.26	in Sweden.
130.26	I've had 12 students work on this
133.26	for their graduate work,
135.26	and the result has been this software called Uniview
138.26	and a company called SCISS in Sweden.
142.26	This software
144.26	allows interactive use,
147.26	so this actual flight path
149.26	and movie that we see here
151.26	was actually flown live.
153.26	I captured this live from my laptop
156.26	in a cafe called Earth Matters
159.26	on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where I live,
162.26	and it was done
164.26	as a collaborative project
166.26	with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art
169.26	for an exhibit
172.26	on comparative cosmology.
176.26	And so as we move out,
178.26	we see continuously from our planet
181.26	all the way out into the realm of galaxies, as we see here,
184.26	light-travel time, giving you a sense of how far away we are.
189.26	As we move out,
191.26	the light from these distant galaxies
193.26	have taken so long,
195.26	we're essentially backing up into the past.
198.26	We back so far up
200.26	we're finally seeing a containment around us --
203.26	the afterglow of the Big Bang.
205.26	This is the WMAP
207.26	microwave background
209.26	that we see.
211.26	We'll fly outside it here, just to see this sort of containment.
214.26	If we were outside this,
216.26	it would almost be meaningless, in the sense as before time.
219.26	But this our containment of the visible universe.
222.26	We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see.
224.26	Coming back quickly,
226.26	we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning,
229.26	but these are positions,
231.26	the latest positions of exoplanets
234.26	that we've mapped,
236.26	and our sun here, obviously, with our own solar system.
241.26	What you're going to see -- we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly
244.26	between several orders of magnitude
246.26	to get down to where we see the solar system --
248.26	these are the paths of
250.26	Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10,
253.26	the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system.
258.26	Coming in closer,
260.26	picking up Earth,
264.26	orbit of the Moon, and we see the Earth.
270.26	This map can be updated,
273.26	and we can add in new data.
275.26	I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I.
277.26	for the Cassini mission.
279.26	But here we see the complex trajectory
281.26	of the Cassini mission
283.26	color coded for different mission phases,
285.26	ingeniously developed so that
289.26	which is larger that the planet Mercury,
291.26	diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase.
296.26	This software allows us to come close
298.26	and look at parts of this.
301.26	This software can also be networked between domes.
304.26	We have a growing user base of this,
306.26	and we network domes.
308.26	And we can network between domes and classrooms.
312.26	We're actually sharing tours of the universe
315.26	with the first sub-Saharan
317.26	planetarium in Ghana
319.26	as well as
321.26	new libraries that have been built
323.26	in the ghettos in Columbia
325.26	and a high school
327.26	in Cambodia.
329.26	And the Cambodians have
331.26	actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school.
335.26	This is an image from Saturday,
337.26	photographed by the Aqua satellite, but through the Uniview software.
340.26	So you're seeing the edge of the Earth.
342.26	This is Nepal.
344.26	This is, in fact, right here is the valley of Lhasa,
347.26	right here in Tibet.
350.26	But we can see the haze
352.26	from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley
354.26	down below in India.
356.26	This is Nepal and Tibet.
360.26	And just in closing,
363.26	I'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on --
368.26	here we see a bit of the snow
370.26	that some of you may have had to brave in coming out --
375.26	so I'd like to just say
377.26	that what the world needs now
379.26	is a sense of being able to
381.26	look at ourselves in this much larger condition now
384.26	and a much larger sense of what home is.
387.26	Because our home is the universe,
389.26	and we are the universe, essentially.
391.26	We carry that in us.
393.26	And to be able to see our context
396.26	in this larger sense at all scales
399.26	helps us all, I think, in understanding
401.26	where we are and who we are in the universe.
403.26	Thank you.
405.26	(Applause)
