12.644	I'd like for you to take a moment
12.644	to imagine this with me.
17.964	You're a little girl of five years old.
21.889	Sitting in front of a mirror,
23.642	you ask yourself,
26.215	"""Do I exist?"""
29.074	In this space, there is
29.074	very little context,
31.75	and so you move into a different one,
34.338	one filled with people.
36.944	Surely, now you know you're not
36.944	a figment of your own imagination.
41.043	You breathe their air.
43.205	You see them,
44.659	so they must see you.
47.168	And yet, you still can't help but wonder:
52.3	Do I only exist when people speak to me?
57.616	Pretty heavy thoughts for a child, right?
60.821	But through various artworks
60.821	that reflect upon our society,
65.353	I came to understand
65.353	how a young black girl can grow up
69.527	feeling as if she's not seen,
69.527	and perhaps she doesn't exist.
76.157	You see, if young people don't have
76.157	positive images of themselves
79.95	and all that remains
79.95	are negative stereotypes,
83.142	this affects their self-image.
86.034	But it also affects the way
86.034	that the rest of society treats them.
91.102	I discovered this
92.362	having lived in Cape Town
92.362	for about five years at the time.
96.934	I felt a deep sense
96.934	of dislocation and invisibility.
103.142	I couldn't see myself represented.
106.181	I couldn't see the women who've raised me,
109.06	the ones who've influenced me,
110.946	and the ones that have made
110.946	South Africa what it is today.
114.709	I decided to do something about it.
118.945	What do you think when you see this?
123.571	If you were a black girl,
125.716	how would it make you feel?
129.093	Walking down the street,
131.562	what does the city you live in say to you?
135.446	What symbols are present?
137.37	Which histories are celebrated?
139.879	And on the other hand,
141.129	which ones are omitted?
143.523	You see, public spaces are hardly
143.523	ever as neutral as they may seem.
148.272	I discovered this when I made
148.272	this performance in 2013 on Heritage Day.
156.092	Cape Town is teeming
156.092	with masculine architecture,
161.251	monuments and statues,
163.334	such as Louis Botha in that photograph.
166.656	This overt presence of white colonial
166.656	and Afrikaner nationalist men
172.596	not only echoes a social,
172.596	gender and racial divide,
178.747	but it also continues to affect
178.747	the way that women --
183.397	and the way, particularly, black women --
186.621	see themselves in relation
186.621	to dominant male figures
192.056	in public spaces.
196.896	For this reason, among others,
199.212	I don't believe that we need statues.
202.326	The preservation of history
202.326	and the act of remembering
206.236	can be achieved in more memorable
206.236	and effective ways.
212.244	As part of a year-long
212.244	public holiday series,
216.127	I use performance art
216.127	as a form of social commentary
220.278	to draw people's attention
220.278	to certain issues,
223.5	as well as addressing the absence
223.5	of the black female body
229.474	in memorialized public spaces,
231.736	especially on public holidays.
234.975	Women's Day was coming up.
237.089	I looked at what the day means --
239.78	the Women's March
239.78	to the union buildings in 1956,
244.459	petitioning against the pass laws.
247.89	Juxtaposed with the hypocrisy
247.89	of how women are treated,
252.72	especially in public spaces today,
255.8	I decided to do something about it.
259.157	Headline:
260.837	[Women in miniskirt attacked at taxi rank]
268.829	How do I comment on such polar opposites?
273.557	In the guise of my great-grandmother,
275.722	I performed bare-breasted,
277.449	close to the taxi rank in KwaLanga.
281.146	This space is also called Freedom Square,
283.751	where women were a part of demonstrations
283.751	against apartheid laws.
288.976	I was not comfortable with women
288.976	being seen as only victims in society.
296.359	You might wonder
296.359	how people reacted to this.
299.751	(Video) Woman: (Cheering)
303.186	Woman 2 (offscreen): Yes!
312.874	Sethembile Msezane: Pretty cool, huh?
315.954	(Applause)
319.702	So I realized that through
319.702	my performances,
322.68	I've been able to make regular people
322.68	reflect upon their society,
327.788	looking at the past
327.788	as well as the current democracy.
331.512	(Video) Man (offscreen):
331.512	She's been there since three o'clock.
334.493	Man 2 (offscreen): Just before three.
334.493	About an hour still?
337.251	Man 1: Yeah. It's just a really hot day.
345.531	Man 1: It's very interesting.
347.539	It's very powerful.
350.144	I think it's cool.
354.463	I think a lot of people
354.463	are quick to join a group
359.812	that's a movement towards something,
361.708	but not many people are ready
361.708	to do something as an individual.
366.959	Man 2: So it's the individual
366.959	versus the collective.
369.59	Man 1: Yeah.
370.77	So I think her pushing her own
370.77	individual message in performance ...
377.74	it's powerful.
380.005	Yeah, I think it's quite powerful
380.005	that she's doing it on her own.
385.286	I'd be interested to know why
385.286	she's using hair extensions as wings,
389.451	or whatever those things are meant to be.
394.694	They are wings, yes?
398.574	Woman 3: With her standing
398.574	there right now,
400.864	I think it's just my interpretation
404.848	that we are bringing the statue down
408.243	and bringing up something
410.492	that's supposed to represent
410.492	African pride, I think.
415.121	Or something like that.
417.621	Something should stand while Rhodes falls,
421.121	I think that's what it's saying. Yeah.
424.568	Yes. Thank you.
425.808	Man 3: What is behind me
425.808	represents the African culture.
429.295	We can't have the colonialist law,
431.708	so we need to remove
431.708	all these colonial statues.
434.623	We have have our own statues now,
437.141	our African leaders --
437.141	Bhambatha, Moshoeshoe, Kwame Nkrumah --
442.037	all those who paid their lives
442.037	for our liberation.
446.294	We can't continue in the 21st century,
448.626	and after 21 years of democracy,
450.687	have the colonizers in our own country.
452.851	They belong somewhere.
452.851	Maybe in a museum; not here.
455.848	I mean learning institutions,
455.848	places where young people,
459.022	young minds are being shaped.
460.624	So we cannot continue to have Louis Botha,
460.624	Rhodes, all these people,
465.338	because they're representing
465.338	the colonialism.
470.519	(Applause)
475.835	Sethembile Msezane: On April 9, 2015,
478.882	the Cecil John Rhodes statue
478.882	was scheduled to be removed
482.883	after a month of debates
482.883	for and against its removal
487.122	by various stakeholders.
490.434	This caused a widespread interest
490.434	in statues in South Africa.
495.031	Opinions varied, but the media
495.031	focused on problematizing
500.386	the removal of statues.
504.912	On that -- well, that year,
504.912	I had just begun my master's
508.771	at the University of Cape Town.
512.065	During the time
512.065	of the debate of the statue,
515.479	I had been having reoccurring dreams
519.413	about a bird.
521.317	And so I started conjuring her
524.019	mentally, spiritually and through dress.
529.872	On that day,
531.589	I happened to be having
531.589	a meeting with my supervisors,
535.249	and they told me that the statue
535.249	was going to fall on that day.
539.925	I told them that I'd explain later,
542.368	but we had to postpone the meeting
544.33	because I was going to perform her
544.33	as the statue came down.
549.352	Her name was Chapungu.
551.256	She was a soapstone bird
551.256	that was looted from Great Zimbabwe
555.66	in the late 1800s,
557.432	and is still currently housed
557.432	in Cecil John Rhodes's estate
561.489	in Cape Town.
563.924	On that day,
565.124	I embodied her existence using my body,
569.258	while standing in the blazing sun
569.258	for nearly four hours.
575.066	As the time came,
576.934	the crane came alive.
579.021	The people did, too --
580.822	shouting,
582.005	screaming,
583.266	clenching their fists
585.2	and taking pictures of the moment
585.2	on their phones and cameras.
589.759	Chapungu's wings,
591.302	along with the crane,
592.725	rose to declare the fall
592.725	of Cecil John Rhodes.
598.963	(Applause)
604.012	Euphoria filled the air
604.012	as he became absent from his base,
608.629	while she remained still,
612.011	very present,
613.634	half an hour after his removal.
618.27	Twenty-three years after apartheid,
621.054	a new generation of radicals
621.054	has arisen in South Africa.
624.481	The story of Chapungu and Rhodes
624.481	in the same space and time
629.378	asks important questions
631.157	related to gender,
634.056	power,
635.357	self-representation,
637.162	history making
638.775	and repatriation.
643.07	From then on,
644.244	I realized that my spiritual
644.244	beliefs and dreams
649.489	texture my material reality.
653.249	But for me, Chapungu's story
653.249	felt incomplete.
656.636	This soapstone bird,
658.409	a spiritual medium and messenger
658.409	of God and the ancestors,
662.8	needed me to continue her story.
665.501	And so I dabbled in the dream space
665.501	a little bit more,
669.941	"and this is how ""Falling"" was born."
679.209	[A film by Sethembile Msezane]
680.7	(Video) (A capella singing)
711.809	[FALLING]
718.734	(Applause)
722.571	In the film,
723.745	Zimbabwe, South Africa and Germany
723.745	share a common story
727.527	about the soapstone birds
727.527	that were looted from Great Zimbabwe.
732.156	After Zimbabwe gained its independence,
734.493	all the birds except for one
734.493	were returned to the monument.
738.984	"""Falling"" explores the mythological belief"
738.984	that there will be unrest
744.134	until the final bird is returned.
748.718	Through my work,
750.065	I have realized a lot
750.065	about the world around me:
754.057	how we move through spaces,
757.109	who we choose to celebrate
759.468	and who we remember.
761.9	Now I look in the mirror
761.9	and not only see an image of myself,
766.679	but of the women
766.679	who have made me who I am today.
770.536	I stand tall in my work,
773.608	celebrating women's histories,
776.093	in the hope that perhaps one day,
779.314	no little black girl has to ever feel
782.594	like she doesn't exist.
784.504	Thank you.
785.748	(Applause)
