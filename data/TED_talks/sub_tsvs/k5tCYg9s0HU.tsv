12.87	June 29, 2016.
19.15	My dear fellow citizen:
22.775	I write to you today,
26.393	to you who have lost in this era.
31.708	At this moment in our common life,
35.95	when the world is full of breaking
38.425	and spite
40.239	and fear,
43.385	I address this letter
45.863	simply to you,
48.494	even though we both know
50.086	"there are many of you behind this ""you,"""
55.306	"and many of me behind this ""I."""
62.525	I write to you because at present,
66.478	this quaking world we share scares me.
72.819	I gather it scares you, too.
76.618	Some of what we fear, I suspect,
79.671	we fear in common.
82.169	But much of what we fear
82.169	seems to be each other.
88.736	You fear the world I want to live in,
92.529	and I fear your visions in turn.
97.673	Do you know that feeling you get
97.673	when you know it's going to storm
102.47	before it storms?
106.001	Do you also feel that now,
109.276	fellow citizen?
112.435	That malaise and worry
116.181	that some who know
119.517	feel reminds them of the 1930s?
123.878	Perhaps you don't,
126.493	because our fears of each other
128.424	are not in sync.
131.325	In this round, I sense
131.325	that your fears of me,
135.655	of the world that I have insisted
135.655	is right for us both,
140.856	has gathered over a generation.
144.017	It took time for your fears
144.017	to trigger my fears,
148.868	not least because at first,
151.666	I never thought I needed to fear you.
156.882	I heard you
159.737	but did not listen,
161.731	all these years when you said
161.731	that this amazing new world
168.204	wasn't amazing for you,
170.879	for many of you,
172.507	across the industrialized world;
175.918	that the open, liquid world I relished,
178.763	of people and goods
178.763	and technologies flowing freely,
183.09	going where they pleased, globally,
187.019	was not, for you, an emancipation.
193.453	I have walked through your towns
197.442	and, while looking, failed to see.
202.799	I did notice in Stephenville, Texas,
207.791	that the town square was dominated
210.122	by one lawyer's office after another,
214.394	because of all the people
214.394	rotating in and out of the prison.
218.224	I did notice the barren shops
218.224	in Wagner, South Dakota,
223.925	and the VFW gathering hall
228.314	that stood in mockery
230.934	of a community's dream to endure.
235.352	I did notice
237.323	at the Lancaster, Pennsylvania Wal-Mart,
241.445	that far too many people
241.445	in their 20s and 30s
245.828	looked a decade or two from death,
249.295	with patchy, flared-up skin
251.665	and thinning, stringy hair
254.165	and browning, ground-down teeth
255.841	and a lostness in their eyes.
260.16	I did notice that the young people
260.16	I encountered in Paris,
264.794	in Florence, in Barcelona,
266.769	had degrees but no place to take them,
271.712	living on internships well into their 30s,
275.693	their lives prevented from launching,
279.868	because of an economy
279.868	that creates wealth --
283.409	just not jobs.
285.836	I did notice the news about those parts
285.836	of London becoming ghost quarters,
293.025	where the global super-rich
293.025	turn fishy money into empty apartments
299.962	and price lifelong residents of a city,
299.962	young couples starting out,
304.088	out of their own home.
308.332	And I heard that the fabric of your life
311.277	was tearing.
313.574	You used to be able to count on work,
316.84	and now you couldn't.
318.977	You used to be able
318.977	to nourish your children,
323.079	and guarantee that they would climb
326.052	a little bit further in life than you had,
330.002	and now you couldn't.
332.374	You used to be made to feel dignity
332.374	in your work, and now you didn't.
339.795	It used to be normal
339.795	for people like you to own a home,
344.47	and now it wasn't.
347.286	I cannot say
350.426	I didn't know these things,
353.701	but I was distracted
357.569	creating a future in which
357.569	we could live on Mars,
363.091	even as you struggled down here on Earth.
368.155	I was distracted
370.455	innovating immortality,
374.519	even as many of you began to live
374.519	shorter lives than your parents had.
381.301	I heard all of these things,
381.301	but I didn't listen.
385.528	I looked
387.566	but didn't see.
389.161	I read, didn't understand.
393.37	I paid attention
395.389	only when you began to vote and shout,
400.428	and when your voting and shouting,
400.428	when the substance of it,
403.516	began to threaten me.
408.235	I listened only when you moved
408.235	toward shattering continental unions
413.252	and electing vulgar demagogues.
416.704	Only then did your pain become of interest
421.343	to me.
424.317	I know that feeling hurt
426.295	is often prologue to dealing hurt.
431.664	I wonder now
434.408	if you would be less eager to deal it
437.438	if I had stood with you
439.402	when you merely felt it.
443.313	I ask myself
445.355	why I didn't stand with you then.
448.874	One reason is that I became entranced
452.275	by the gurus of change,
455.187	became a worshiper of the religion
455.187	of the new for novelty's sake,
459.546	and of globalization and open borders
461.723	and kaleidoscopic diversity.
466.928	Once change became my totalizing faith,
472.415	I could be blind.
475.143	I could fail to see change's consequences.
479.866	I could overlook the importance
481.827	of roots, traditions,
481.827	rituals, stability --
484.953	and belonging.
487.501	And the more fundamentalist I became
490.84	in my worship of change and openness,
496.09	the more I drove you
496.09	towards the other polarity,
500.074	to cling,
501.632	to freeze,
503.277	to close,
505.1	to belong.
508.138	I now see as I didn't before
510.878	that not having
510.878	the right skin or right organ
514.843	is not the only varietal of disadvantage.
519.722	There is a subtler, quieter disadvantage
523.336	in having those privileged traits
526.675	and yet feeling history to be
526.675	moving away from you;
531.082	that while the past was hospitable
531.082	to people like you,
534.499	the future will be more hospitable
536.921	to others;
538.338	that the world is growing less familiar,
540.815	less yours day by day.
545.865	I will not concede for a moment
545.865	that old privileges should not dwindle.
552.055	They cannot dwindle fast enough.
555.785	It is for you to learn to live
555.785	in a new century in which
559.31	there are no bonuses for showing up
559.31	with the right skin and right organs.
565.277	If and when your anger turns to hate,
567.729	please know that there is no space
567.729	for that in our shared home.
573.642	But I will admit, fellow citizen,
578.14	that I have discounted the burden
578.14	of coping with the loss of status.
584.163	I have forgotten
585.957	that what is socially necessary
585.957	can also be personally gruelling.
592.919	A similar thing happened
595.217	with the economy that you and I share.
600.191	Just as I cannot and don't wish
602.647	to turn back to the clock
602.647	on equality and diversity,
606.298	and yet must understand
608.651	the sense of loss they can inspire,
613.027	so, too, I refuse
613.027	and could not if I wished
617.97	turn back the clock on an ever more
617.97	closely knit, interdependent world,
622.135	and on inventions
622.135	that won't stop being invented.
626.52	And yet I must understand
626.52	your experience of these things.
633.032	You have for years been telling me
633.032	that your experience of these things
636.475	is not as good as my theories forecast.
640.528	Yet before you could finish
640.528	a complaining sentence
646.116	about the difficulty of living
646.116	with erratic hours, volatile pay,
651.628	vanishing opportunities,
653.278	about the pain of dropping
653.278	your children off at 24-hour day care
657.56	to make your 3am shift,
660.319	I shot back at you -- before you
660.319	could finish your sentence --
664.256	my dogma,
665.622	about how what you are actually
665.622	experiencing was flexibility
670.794	and freedom.
674.591	Language is one of the only things
674.591	that we truly share,
680.549	and I sometimes used
680.549	this joint inheritance
684.052	to obfuscate
685.821	and deflect
687.479	and justify myself;
689.933	to re-brand what was good for me
691.837	as something appearing good for us both,
695.324	when I threw around terms
695.324	"like ""the sharing economy,"""
700.135	"and ""disruption"""
701.845	"and ""global resourcing."""
705.224	I see now that what I was really doing,
708.229	at times,
709.894	was buying your pain on the cheap,
713.892	sprucing it up
715.772	and trying to sell it back to you
718.244	as freedom.
721.712	I have wanted to believe
721.712	and wanted you to believe
727.683	that the system that has been good to me,
729.816	that has made my life ever more seamless,
733.229	is also the best system for you.
737.544	I have condescended to you
739.829	with the idea that you are voting
739.829	against your economic interests --
744.207	voting against your interests,
747.621	as if I know your interests.
752.296	That is just my dogmatic
752.296	economism talking.
757.723	I have a weakness
759.524	for treating people's economic interests
759.524	as their only interest,
764.933	ignoring things like belonging and pride
768.481	and the desire to send a message
768.481	to those who ignore you.
772.688	So here we are,
776.243	in a scary but not inexplicable moment
781.507	of demagoguery, fracture,
784.481	xenophobia, resentment and fear.
789.628	And I worry for us both
789.628	if we continue down this road,
794.358	me not listening,
796.305	you feeling unheard,
798.18	you shouting to get me to listen.
802.779	I worry when each of us is seduced
802.779	by visions of the future
806.254	that have no place for the other.
809.731	If this goes on,
813.655	if this goes on,
816.053	there may be blood.
819.29	There are already hints of this blood
822.915	in newspapers every day.
824.967	There may be roundups, raids,
827.586	deportations, camps, secessions.
831.494	And no, I do not think that I exaggerate.
836.236	There may be even talk of war
838.181	in places that were certain
838.181	they were done with it.
843.483	There is always the hope of redemption.
847.764	But it will not be a cheap,
847.764	shallow redemption
851.066	that comes through blather
851.066	about us all being in it together.
855.312	This will take more.
858.396	It will take accepting that we both
858.396	made choices to be here.
865.863	"We create our ""others."""
869.975	As parents, as neighbors, as citizens,
874.503	we witness and sometimes ignore each other
878.858	into being.
881.268	You were not born vengeful.
885.339	I have some role
887.37	in whatever thirst
887.37	you now feel for revenge,
891.685	and that thirst now tempts me
893.622	to plot ever more elaborate escapes
896.164	from our common life,
898.107	from the schools and neighborhoods
900	and airports and amusement parks
901.955	that we used to share.
905.659	We face, then,
908.671	a problem not of these large,
908.671	impersonal forces.
914.366	We face a problem
914.366	of your and my relations.
919.815	We chose ways of relating to each other
924.345	that got us here.
925.896	We can choose ways of relating
928.669	that get us out.
931.361	But there are things
931.361	we might have to let go of,
935.418	fellow citizen,
937.674	starting with our own cherished
937.674	versions of reality.
945.035	Imagine if you let go of fantasies
948.928	of a society purged
948.928	of these or those people.
953.561	Imagine if I let go of my habit
957.755	of saving the world behind your back,
961.833	of deliberating on the future
963.254	of your work,
965.26	your food,
966.53	your schools,
968.024	in places where you couldn't
968.024	get past security.
972.386	We can do this only if we first accept
977.347	that we have neglected each other.
981.971	If there is hope to summon
985.93	in this ominous hour,
988.202	it is this.
990.87	We have, for too long,
993.547	chased various shimmering dreams
997.818	at the cost of attention
997.818	to the foundational dream of each other,
1005.101	the dream of tending to each other,
1007.693	of unleashing each other's wonders,
1010.58	of moving through history together.
1014.046	We could dare to commit
1014.046	to the dream of each other
1019.009	as the thing that matters
1019.009	before every neon thing.
1024.476	Let us dare.
1026.467	Sincerely yours,
1028.067	a fellow citizen.
1029.683	(Applause)
