15.26	Both myself and my brother
17.26	belong to the under 30 demographic,
19.26	which Pat said makes 70 percent,
21.26	but according to our statistics
23.26	it makes 60 percent of the region's population.
26.26	Qatar is no exception to the region.
28.26	It's a very young nation led by young people.
31.26	We have been reminiscing about the latest technologies
34.26	and the iPods,
36.26	and for me the abaya,
38.26	my traditional dress that I'm wearing today.
40.26	Now this is not a religious garment,
42.26	nor is it a religious statement.
44.26	Instead, it's a diverse cultural statement
47.26	that we choose to wear.
49.26	Now I remember a few years ago,
51.26	a journalist asked Dr. Sheikha, who's sitting here,
54.26	president of Qatar University --
56.26	who, by the way, is a woman --
58.26	he asked her whether she thought
60.26	the abaya hindered or infringed her freedom in any way.
63.26	Her answer was quite the contrary.
65.26	Instead, she felt more free,
67.26	more free because she could wear whatever she wanted
69.26	under the abaya.
71.26	She could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care.
74.26	(Laughter)
76.26	Not that you do; I'm just saying.
78.26	(Laughter)
80.26	My point is here, people have a choice --
82.26	just like the Indian lady could wear her sari
84.26	or the Japanese woman could wear her kimono.
87.26	We are changing our culture from within,
89.26	but at the same time
91.26	we are reconnecting with our traditions.
93.26	We know that modernization is happening.
95.26	And yes, Qatar wants to be a modern nation.
97.26	But at the same time
99.26	we are reconnecting and reasserting our Arab heritage.
102.26	It's important for us to grow organically.
105.26	And we continuously make the conscious decision
107.26	to reach that balance.
109.26	In fact, research has shown
112.26	that the more the world is flat,
114.26	if I use Tom Friedman's analogy,
116.26	or global,
118.26	the more and more people are wanting to be different.
120.26	And for us young people,
122.26	they're looking to become individuals
124.26	and find their differences amongst themselves.
126.26	Which is why I prefer the Richard Wilk analogy
129.26	of globalizing the local
131.26	and localizing the global.
133.26	We don't want to be all the same,
135.26	but we want to respect each other and understand each other.
138.26	And therefore tradition becomes more important,
140.26	not less important.
142.26	Life necessitates a universal world,
145.26	however, we believe in the security
147.26	of having a local identity.
149.26	And this is what the leaders of this region
151.26	are trying to do.
153.26	We're trying to be part of this global village,
155.26	but at the same time we're revising ourselves
158.26	through our cultural institutions and cultural development.
162.26	I'm a representation of that phenomenon.
165.26	And I think a lot of people in this room,
167.26	I can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself.
169.26	And I'm sure, although we can't see the people in Washington,
172.26	they are in the same position.
174.26	We're continuously trying to straddle
176.26	different worlds, different cultures
178.26	and trying to meet the challenges
180.26	of a different expectation
182.26	from ourselves and from others.
184.26	So I want to ask a question:
186.26	What should culture in the 21st century look like?
189.26	In a time where the world is becoming personalized,
192.26	when the mobile phone, the burger, the telephone,
195.26	everything has its own personal identity,
197.26	how should we perceive ourselves
199.26	and how should we perceive others?
201.26	How does that impact our desert culture?
204.26	I'm not sure of how many of you in Washington
207.26	are aware of the cultural developments happening in the region
210.26	and, the more recent, Museum of Islamic Art
212.26	opened in Qatar in 2008.
215.26	I myself am personalizing these cultural developments,
218.26	but I also understand
220.26	that this has to be done organically.
222.26	Yes, we do have all the resources that we need
225.26	in order to develop new cultural institutions,
228.26	but what I think is more important
230.26	is that we are very fortunate
232.26	to have visionary leaders
234.26	who understand that this can't happen from outside,
236.26	it has to come from within.
238.26	And guess what?
240.26	You might be surprised to know that most people in the Gulf
243.26	who are leading these cultural initiatives
245.26	happen to be women.
247.26	I want to ask you, why do you think this is?
250.26	Is it because it's a soft option;
252.26	we have nothing else to do?
254.26	No, I don't think so.
256.26	I think that women in this part of the world
259.26	realize that culture is an important component
261.26	to connect people
263.26	both locally and regionally.
265.26	It's a natural component
267.26	for bringing people together, discussing ideas --
270.26	in the same way we're doing here at TED.
272.26	We're here, we're part of a community,
274.26	sharing out ideas and discussing them.
277.26	Art becomes a very important part
279.26	of our national identity.
281.26	The existential and social and political impact
285.26	an artist has
287.26	on his nation's development of cultural identity
289.26	is very important.
291.26	You know, art and culture is big business.
293.26	Ask me.
295.26	Ask the chairpersons and CEOs
297.26	of Sotheby's and Christie's.
299.26	Ask Charles Saatchi about great art.
302.26	They make a lot of money.
304.26	So I think women in our society
306.26	are becoming leaders,
308.26	because they realize
310.26	that for their future generations,
312.26	it's very important
314.26	to maintain our cultural identities.
316.26	Why else do Greeks demand the return
318.26	of the Elgin Marbles?
320.26	And why is there an uproar
322.26	when a private collector tries to sell his collection
324.26	to a foreign museum?
326.26	Why does it take me months on end
328.26	to get an export license from London or New York
331.26	in order to get pieces into my country?
334.26	In few hours, Shirin Neshat, my friend from Iran
337.26	who's a very important artist for us
340.26	will be talking to you.
342.26	She lives in New York City, but she doesn't try to be a Western artist.
345.26	Instead, she tries to engage
347.26	in a very important dialogue
349.26	about her culture, nation and heritage.
351.26	She does that through important visual forms
354.26	of photography and film.
356.26	In the same way, Qatar is trying to grow its national museums
360.26	through an organic process from within.
363.26	Our mission is of cultural integration and independence.
366.26	We don't want to have what there is in the West.
368.26	We don't want their collections.
370.26	We want to build our own identities, our own fabric,
373.26	create an open dialogue
375.26	so that we share our ideas
377.26	and share yours with us.
379.26	In a few days,
381.26	we will be opening the Arab Museum of Modern Art.
384.26	We have done extensive research
386.26	to ensure that Arab and Muslim artists,
388.26	and Arabs who are not Muslims --
390.26	not all Arabs are Muslims, by the way --
392.26	but we make sure that they are represented
394.26	in this new institution.
397.26	This institution is government-backed
399.26	and it has been the case
401.26	for the past three decades.
403.26	We will open the museum in a few days,
405.26	and I welcome all of you to get on Qatar Airways
408.26	and come and join us.
410.26	(Laughter)
412.26	Now this museum is just as important to us as the West.
416.26	Some of you might have heard
418.26	of the Algerian artist Baya Mahieddine,
421.26	but I doubt a lot of people know
423.26	that this artist worked in Picasso's studio
426.26	in Paris in the 1930s.
428.26	For me it was a new discovery.
430.26	And I think with time, in the years to come
433.26	we'll be learning a lot about our Picassos,
435.26	our Legers and our Cezannes.
437.26	We do have artists,
439.26	but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet.
442.26	Now visual expression is just one form
445.26	of culture integration.
448.26	We have realized that recently
450.26	more and more people
452.26	are using the means of YouTube and social networking
455.26	to express their stories, share their photos
458.26	and tell their own stories through their own voices.
460.26	In a similar way,
462.26	we have created the Doha Film Institute.
464.26	Now the Doha Film Institute is an organization
467.26	to teach people about film and filmmaking.
470.26	Last year we didn't have one Qatari woman filmmaker.
473.26	Today I am proud to say
475.26	we have trained and educated
477.26	over 66 Qatari women filmmakers
479.26	to edit, tell their own stories
481.26	in their own voices.
483.26	(Applause)
489.26	Now if you'll allow me, I would love to share a one-minute film
492.26	that has proven to show
494.26	that a 60-sec film can be as powerful as a haiku
497.26	in telling a big picture.
499.26	And this is one of our filmmakers' products.
502.26	(Video) Boy: Hey listen! Did you know that the stocks are up?
505.26	Who are you playing?
507.26	Girl: Uncle Khaled. Here, put on the headscarf.
509.26	Khaled: Why would I want to put it on?
511.26	Girl: Do as you're told, young girl.
513.26	Boy: No, you play mom and I play dad. (Girl: But it's my game.)
516.26	Play by yourself then.
518.26	Girl: Women! One word and they get upset.
521.26	Useless.
527.26	Thank you. Thank you!
531.26	(Applause)
538.26	SM: Going back to straddling between East and West,
541.26	last month we had our second Doha Tribeca Film Festival
544.26	here in Doha.
546.26	The Doha Tribeca Film Festival
548.26	was held at our new cultural hub, Katara.
551.26	It attracted 42,000 people,
553.26	and we showcased 51 films.
555.26	Now the Doha Tribeca Film Festival
557.26	is not an imported festival,
559.26	but rather an important festival
561.26	between the cities of New York and Doha.
564.26	It's important for two things.
566.26	First, it allows us to showcase
568.26	our Arab filmmakers and voices
570.26	to one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world,
572.26	New York City.
574.26	At the same time, we are inviting them
576.26	to come and explore our part of the world.
578.26	They're learning our culture, our language, our heritage
581.26	and realizing we're just as different
584.26	and just the same as each other.
587.26	Now over and over again,
589.26	"people have said, ""Let's build bridges,"""
591.26	and frankly, I want to do more than that.
593.26	I would like break the walls of ignorance
595.26	between East and West --
597.26	no, not the soft option that we have discussed before,
600.26	but rather the soft power
602.26	that Joseph Nye has spoken about before.
605.26	Culture's a very important tool to bring people together.
608.26	We should not underestimate it.
611.26	"""Know thyself,"""
613.26	that is the journey of self-expression and self-realization
615.26	that we are traveling.
617.26	Now I don't pretend to have all the answers,
619.26	but I know that me as an individual
621.26	and we as a nation
623.26	welcome this community
625.26	of ideas worth spreading.
627.26	This is a very interesting journey.
629.26	I welcome you on board
631.26	for us to engage and discuss new ideas
634.26	of how to bring people together
636.26	through cultural initiatives and discussions.
638.26	Familiarity destroys and trumps fear. Try it.
642.26	Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Shokran.
645.26	(Applause)
