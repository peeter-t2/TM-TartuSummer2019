16.43	"""My Air Jordans cost a hundred with tax."
21.117	My suede Starters jacket says Raiders on the back.
25.665	I'm stylin', smilin', lookin' real mean,
28.655	because it ain't about being heard, just being seen.
32.569	My leather Adidas baseball cap matches
34.706	my fake Gucci backpack. (Laughter)
38.325	Ain't nobody who looks as good as me,
40.874	but this costs money, it sure ain't free,
43.25	and I gots no job, no money at all,
45.103	but it's easy to steal all this from the mall.
47.475	Parents say I shouldn't, but I knows I should.
50.312	Got to do what I can to make sure I look good,
53.003	and the reason I have to look real good, well, to tell you the truth, man,
55.994	I don't know why. Guess it makes me feel special inside.
60.983	When I'm wearing fresh gear I don't have to hide,
63.867	and I really must get some new gear soon
65.798	or my ego will pop like a 10-cent balloon.
67.769	But security is tight at all the shops. Every day there are more and more cops.
71.674	My crew is laughing at me because I'm wearing old gear.
74.197	School's almost over. Summer is near.
77.05	And I'm sportin' torn Jordans.
79.543	I need something new. Only one thing left to do.
84.843	Cut school Friday, catch the subway downtown,
88.603	check out my victims hangin' around.
90.986	Maybe I'll get lucky and find easy prey.
93.026	Got to get some new gear. There's no other way.
95.212	I'm ready and willing. I'm packing my gun.
97.57	This is serious business. This ain't no fun.
100.026	And I can't have my posse laughin' at me.
102.594	I'mma cop something dope, just wait, you'll see.
106.349	Come out of the station, West 4th near the park,
108.934	brothers shooting hoops and someone remarks,
111.171	'Hey homes, where you get them Nik's?'
112.633	I says to myself, 'Yeah. I likes 'em, I likes.'
117.027	They were Q-tip white, bright and blinding my eyes.
119.795	The red emblem of Michael looked as if it could fly.
122.475	Not one spot of dirt. The Airs were brand new.
124.909	Had my pistol and knew just what to do.
126.629	Waited until it was just the right time, followed him very closely behind.
129.816	He made a left turn on Houston, I pulled out my gun,
132.419	and I said, 'Gimme them Jordans!'
135.165	And the punk tried to run.
137.435	Took off fast, didn't get far. I fired,'Pow!'
140.197	Fool fell between two parked cars.
142.115	He was coughing, crying, blood spilled on the street.
145.234	And I snatched them Air Jordans off of his feet.
149.019	While laying there dying, all he could say
151.132	"was, ""Please man, don't take my Air Jordans away."""
156.195	You'd think he'd be worried about staying alive.
158.924	As I took off with his sneakers, there was tears in his eyes.
162.538	Very next day, I bopped into school
165.436	with my brand new Air Jordans, man, I was cool.
168.842	I killed to get 'em, but hey, I don't care,
171.33	"because now I needs a new jacket to wear."""
175.499	Thank you. (Applause)
184.308	For the last 15 years that I have been performing,
189.239	all I ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world.
193.969	See, it wasn't enough for me to write a book.
196.425	It wasn't enough for me to join a slam competition,
199.025	and while those things hold weight,
201.497	it wasn't the driving force that pushes the pen to the pad.
205.185	The hunger and thirst was, and still remains:
209.073	How do I get people who hate poetry
212.001	to love me?
214.889	Because I'm an extension of my work,
217.188	and if they love me, then they will love my work,
219.092	and if they love my work, then they will love poetry,
222.359	and if they love poetry, then I will have done my job,
225.505	which is to transcend it to the world.
228.612	And in 1996, I found the answer in principles
233.467	in a master spoken-word artist named Reg E. Gaines,
238.118	"who wrote the famous poem, ""Please Don't Take My Air Jordans."""
242.977	And I followed this guy everywhere until I had him in the room,
247.022	and I read him one of my pieces,
249.364	and you know what he told me?
251.61	"""Yo' wack."
253.567	You know what the problem is with you, homie?
256.601	You don't read other people's poetry,
259.041	and you don't got any subordination for verbal measures
262.171	"to tonal consideration."" (Laughter)"
267.896	Now he kept on rambling
271.093	about poetry and styles and Nuyorican Friday nights.
275.898	Now I could have quit. I should have quit.
278.75	I mean, I thought poetry was just self-expression.
282.23	I didn't know you actually have to have creative control.
285.615	So instead of quitting, I followed him everywhere.
289.598	When he was writing a Broadway show, I would be outside of the door.
293.015	I would wake him up at, like, 6:30 in the morning
296.395	to ask him who's the best poet.
298.871	I remember eating the eyes of a fish right out of the sea
303.111	because he told me it was brain food.
305.639	Then one day I told him,
308.495	"""Reg E., what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration?"" (Laughter)"
315.831	And he handed me a black-and-white printed out thesis
319.951	on a poet named Etheridge Knight
322.879	and the oral nature of poetry,
325.296	and from that point,
326.835	Reggie stopped becoming the best to me,
329.323	because what Etheridge Knight taught me
332.351	was that I could make my words sound like music,
336.257	even my small ones, the monosyllables,
339.167	the ifs, ands, buts, whats,
341.267	the gangsta in my slang could fall right on the ear,
345.789	and from then on, I started chasing Etheridge Knight.
348.959	I wanted to know which poet he read,
351.191	"and I landed on a poem called [""Dark Prophecy: Sing of Shine""],"
355.287	a toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage
359.927	a poet could ever be:
362.511	Broadway, baby.
365.103	And from that point, I learned how to pull the mic away
368.447	and attack the poetry with my body.
372.283	But that wasn't the biggest lesson I ever learned.
374.991	The biggest lesson I learned was many years later
379.365	when I went to Beverly Hills and I ran into a talent agent
384.183	who looked at me up and down
386.634	and said I don't look like I have any experience
389.631	to be working in this business.
391.989	"And I said to him, ""Listen, punk fool,"
396.058	you're a failed actor who became an agent,
399.168	and you know why you failed as an actor?
400.732	Because people like me took your job.
403.942	I've traveled all the way from Cleveland and Essex
406.71	in East New York, took the local 6 line up to the hookers of Hunt's Point
410.101	who were in my way on my way to master the art of space,
414.137	and the one-to-infinite amount of man, woman and child
416.452	you can fit in there only so I can push them
418.63	to the back of the wall with my experience.
421.421	People have bought tickets to my experience
423.5	and used them as refrigerator magnets to let them know
426.205	that the revolution is near, so stock up.
428.385	I'm so experienced that when you went
430.765	to a privileged school to learn a Shakespearean sonnet,
433.408	I was getting those beats kicked and shoved into me.
435.973	"I can master shock of ""The Crying Game"" with the awe"
438.773	of a child being called an AIDS victim by a bully who didn't know
442.709	that it was his father who gave it to my mother,
445.702	and that's a double entendre.
447.554	I'm so experienced that when you went to the Fell School
450.797	and all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a child
453.168	in it, that was me, but kicked me out when I was caught
455.492	teaching the fairy boys how to rob the PATS off a pair of Lee Jeans
459.168	and bring them to VIM. Let me see Chekhov pull that off.
462.512	Sanford Meisner was my Uncle Artie yelling silently to himself,
465.566	"""Something's always wrong when nothing's always right."""
467.864	Method acting is nothing but a mixture
470.528	of multiple personalities, believing your own lies are reality,
473.464	like in high school cool Kenny telling me he wanted to be a cop.
476.552	Dude, you go to Riker's Island Academy.
478.648	I could make David Mamet
480.115	psychoanalyze my attack on dialogue,
482.556	Stanislavski be as if he were Bruce Lee
486.155	kicking your roster of talentless students up and down Crenshaw.
489.462	So what, your actors studied guerrilla theater at the London Rep?
492.451	Let me tell you an ancient Chinese Saturday afternoon
495.195	kung fu secret.
497.659	Boards don't hit back.
499.496	You think black entertainers have it hard finding work
501.734	in this business? I'm a suspicious mulatto,
504.097	which means I'm too black to be white and too white to be doing it right.
507.163	Forget the American ghetto. I've cracked stages in Soweto,
510.059	buried abortion babies in potter's field and still managed to keep a smile on my face,
514.203	so whatever you curse at me to your caddyshack
516.618	go-for-this, go-for-that assistant when I walk out that door,
519.283	whatever slander you send my way,
522.987	your mother.
525.107	Thank you. (Applause)
