16.098	This is Nina Rodríguez's Facebook profile.
20.892	This person had three different profiles
23.106	and 890 kids between 8 and 13 years old
23.106	among her friends list.
30.647	These are excerpts of a chat
30.647	with one of those kids.
37.205	This is an exact copy of the chat.
40.47	It's part of the case file.
44.706	This kid started sending private photos
48.186	until his family realized
48.186	what was going on.
51.691	The police report and subsequent
51.691	investigation lead them to a house.
57.229	This was the girl's bedroom.
62.271	Nina Rodríguez was actually
62.271	a 24-year-old man
67.302	that used to do this with lots of kids.
73.291	Micaela Ortega was 12 years old
76.517	when she went to meet
76.517	her new Facebook friend,
79.316	also 12.
81.487	"""Rochi de River,"" was her name."
85.962	She actually met Jonathan Luna,
85.962	who was 26 years old.
90.431	When they finally caught him,
92.105	he confessed that he killed the girl
92.105	because she refused to have sex with him.
98.516	He had four Facebook profiles
101.526	and 1,700 women on his contact list;
	were under 13 years old.
112.349	These are two different
112.349	"cases of ""grooming"":"
116.015	an adult contacts a kid
116.015	through the internet,
120.083	and through manipulation or lying,
120.083	leads that kid into sexual territory --
124.451	from talking about sex
126.346	to sharing private photos,
128.554	recording the kid using a webcam
130.795	or arranging an in-person meeting.
134.347	This is grooming.
136.409	This is happening, and it's on the rise.
141.547	The question is: What are we going to do?
144.027	Because, in the meantime, kids are alone.
148.544	They finish dinner, go to their rooms,
150.584	close the door,
152.784	get on their computer, their cell phones,
155.231	and get into a bar,
158.524	into a club.
162.104	Think for one second
162.104	about what I've just said:
166.572	they're in a place full of strangers
169.444	in an uninhibited environment.
173.673	The internet broke physical boundaries.
176.564	When we're alone in our bedroom
176.564	and we go online,
180.619	we're not really alone.
185.28	There are at least two reasons
185.28	why we're not taking care of this,
189.984	or at least not in the right way.
193.599	First, we're sure that everything
193.599	"that happens online is ""virtual."""
198.03	"In fact, we call it ""the virtual world."""
202.839	If you look it up in the dictionary,
205.636	something virtual is something
205.636	that seems to exist
208.135	but is not real.
210.848	And we use that word
210.848	to talk about the internet:
215.044	something not real.
218.687	And that's the problem with grooming.
221.094	It is real.
223.534	Degenerate, perverted adults
223.534	use the internet to abuse boys and girls
229.372	and take advantage of, among other things,
231.481	the fact that the kids and their parents
231.481	think that what happens online
234.915	doesn't actually happen.
239.451	Several years ago,
239.451	some colleagues and I founded an NGO
243.184	"called ""Argentina Cibersegura,"""
245.152	dedicated to raising awareness
245.152	about online safety.
250.498	In 2013, we attended meetings
250.498	at the House of Legislature
254.723	to discuss a law about grooming.
259.508	I remember that a lot of people thought
261.807	that grooming was strictly a precursor
264.003	to arranging an in-person meeting
264.003	with a kid to have sex with them.
270.067	But they didn't think about what happened
270.067	to the kids who were exposed
273.695	by talking about sex
273.695	with an adult without knowing it,
277.724	or who shared intimate photos thinking
277.724	only another kid would see them,
281.494	or even worse,
283.707	who had exposed themselves
283.707	using their web cam.
286.695	Nobody considered that rape.
291.047	I'm sure lots of you find it odd to think
291.047	one person can abuse another
295.388	without physical contact.
297.562	We're programmed to think that way.
301.003	I know, because I used to think that way.
303.094	I was just an IT security guy
307.168	until this happened to me.
311.243	At the end of 2011,
313.999	in a little town in Buenos Aires Province,
316.562	I heard about a case for the first time.
320.6	After giving a talk,
323.108	I met the parents of an 11-year-old girl
323.108	who had been a victim of grooming.
329.934	A man had manipulated her
329.934	into masturbating in front of her web cam,
333.981	and recorded it.
336.027	And the video was on several websites.
340.801	That day, her parents asked us, in tears,
343.506	to tell them the magic formula
345.072	for how to delete those videos
345.072	from the internet.
349.856	It broke my heart and changed me forever
353.537	to be their last disappointment,
353.537	telling them it was too late:
357.491	once content is online,
360.061	we've already lost control.
364.534	Since that day, I think about that girl
368.93	waking up in the morning,
368.93	having breakfast with her family,
372.496	who had seen the video,
375.031	and then walking to school, meeting
375.031	people that had seen her naked,
380.484	arriving to school, playing with
380.484	her friends, who had also seen her.
386.65	That was her life.
389.322	Exposed.
393.581	Of course, nobody raped her body.
397.175	But hadn't her sexuality been abused?
402.543	We clearly use different standards
402.543	to measure physical and digital things.
409.183	And we get angry at social networks
411.143	because being angry with ourselves
411.143	is more painful and more true.
416.595	And this brings us
416.595	to the second reason why
418.657	we aren't paying proper
418.657	attention to this issue.
422	We're convinced that kids
422	don't need our help,
426.513	"that they ""know everything"""
426.513	about technology.
431.912	When I was a kid,
434.41	at one point, my parents started
434.41	letting me walk to school alone.
439.149	After years of taking me by the hand
439.149	and walking me to school,
444.296	one day they sat me down,
445.906	gave me the house keys
447.773	"and said, ""Be very careful with these;"
447.773	don't give them to anyone,
451.784	take the route we showed you,
451.784	be at home at the time we said,
455.963	cross at the corner,
455.963	and look both ways before you cross,
458.726	and no matter what,
458.726	"don't talk to strangers."""
464.787	I knew everything about walking,
467.708	and yet, there was a responsible adult
467.708	there taking care of me.
472.706	Knowing how to do something is one thing,
474.706	knowing how to take care
474.706	of yourself is another.
478.469	Imagine this situation:
480.381	I'm 10 or 11 years old,
480.381	I wake up in the morning,
482.969	my parents toss me the keys and say,
485.109	"""Seba, now you can walk to school alone."""
488.307	And when I come back late,
491.355	"they say, ""No, you need to be home"
491.355	"at the time we said."""
496.646	And two weeks later,
498.534	when it comes up,
498.534	"they say, ""You know what?"
501.667	You have to cross at the corner,
501.667	"and look both ways before crossing."""
506.635	And two years later, they say,
509.301	"""And also, don't talk to strangers."""
514.686	It sounds absurd, right?
518.132	We have the same absurd behavior
518.132	in relation to technology.
521.949	We give kids total access
524.116	and we see if one day, sooner or later,
526.98	they learn how to take care of themselves.
530.762	Knowing how to do something is one thing,
532.79	knowing how to take care
532.79	of yourself is another.
536.523	Along those same lines,
536.523	when we talk to parents,
539.124	they often say they don't care
539.124	about technology and social networks.
546.022	I always rejoin that by asking
546.022	if they care about their kids.
549.796	As adults, being interested
549.796	or not in technology
552.284	is the same as being interested
552.284	or not in our kids.
555.13	The internet is part of their lives.
558.52	Technology forces us to rethink
558.52	the relationship between adults and kids.
564.804	Education was always based
564.804	on two main concepts:
568.028	experience and knowledge.
572.507	How do we teach our kids to be safe online
572.507	when we don't have either?
579.875	Nowadays, we adults
579.875	have to guide our children
582.638	through what is often for us
582.638	unfamiliar territory --
585.12	territory much more inviting for them.
589.321	It's impossible to find an answer
592.413	without doing new things --
592.413	things that make us uncomfortable,
595.485	things we're not used to.
599.401	A lot of you may think it's easy for me,
602.116	because I'm relatively young.
604.501	And it used to be that way.
607.162	Used to.
610.069	Until last year,
611.959	when I felt the weight
611.959	of my age on my shoulders
617.242	the first time I opened Snapchat.
622.21	(Laughter)
626.33	(Applause)
631.405	I didn't understand a thing!
635.141	I found it unnecessary,
637.493	useless, hard to understand;
640.659	it looked like a camera!
642.571	It didn't have menu options!
646.58	It was the first time I felt the gap
649.292	that sometimes exists
649.292	between kids and adults.
653.562	But it was also an opportunity
653.562	to do the right thing,
656.846	to leave my comfort zone, to force myself.
660.768	I never thought I'd ever use Snapchat,
664.103	but then I asked my teenage cousin
664.103	to show me how to use it.
670.169	I also asked why she used it.
672.608	What was fun about it?
675.558	We had a really nice talk.
677.749	She showed me her Snapchat,
677.749	she told me things,
680.226	we got closer, we laughed.
684.769	Today, I use it.
686.495	(Laughter)
688.608	I don't know if I do it right,
690.257	but the most important thing
690.257	is that I know it and I understand it.
696.226	The key was to overcome the initial shock
700.387	and do something new.
703.76	Something new.
705.264	Today, we have the chance
705.264	to create new conversations.
709.132	What's the last app you downloaded?
711.472	Which social network do you use
711.472	to contact your friends?
714.894	What kind of information do you share?
718.379	Have you ever been
718.379	approached by strangers?
722.682	Could we have these conversations
722.682	between kids and adults?
727.356	We have to force ourselves
727.356	to do it. All of us.
730.063	Today, lots of kids are listening to us.
736.527	Sometimes when we go
736.527	to schools to give our talks,
739.284	or through social networks,
740.958	kids ask or tell us things
743.312	they haven't told
743.312	their parents or their teachers.
747.633	They tell us -- they don't even know us.
752.786	Those kids need to know
755.955	what the risks of being online are,
759.994	how to take care of themselves,
761.524	but also that, fundamentally,
761.524	as with almost everything else,
765.115	kids can learn this from any adult.
771.378	Online safety needs to be
771.378	a conversation topic
775.288	in every house and every
775.288	classroom in the country.
779.683	We did a survey this year that showed
779.683	that 15 percent of schools said
783.972	they knew of cases of grooming
783.972	in their school.
787.206	And this number is growing.
791.65	Technology changed
791.65	every aspect of our life,
795.135	including the risks we face
797.9	and how we take care of ourselves.
800.326	Grooming shows us this
800.326	in the most painful way:
804.908	by involving our kids.
808.607	Are we going to do something
808.607	to avoid this?
812.022	The solution starts
812.022	with something as easy as:
816.239	talking about it.
817.528	Thank you.
818.71	(Applause)
