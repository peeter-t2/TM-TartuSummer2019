16.43	As a magician, I'm always interested in performances that incorporate elements of illusion.
21.632	And one of the most remarkable was the tanagra theater, which was popular in the
26.978	early part of the 20th century.
29.055	It used mirrors
30.971	to create the illusion of tiny people
33.769	performing on a miniature stage. Now, I won't use mirrors,
37.809	but this is my digital tribute to the tanagra theater.
42.905	So let the story begin.
49.368	On a dark and stormy night -- really! --
54.306	it was the 10th of July, 1856.
58.417	Lightning lit the sky,
60.361	and a baby was born.
62.448	His name was Nikola,
65.456	Nikola Tesla.
67.1	Now the baby grew into a very smart guy.
70.12	Let me show you.
72.264	Tesla, what is 236 multiplied by 501?
79.812	Nikola Tesla: The result is 118,236.
84.358	Marco Tempest: Now Tesla's brain worked in the most extraordinary way.
88.931	When a word was mentioned,
91.084	an image of it
92.147	instantly appeared in his mind.
95.348	Tree. Chair. Girl.
101.06	They were hallucinations, which vanished
104.243	the moment he touched them.
106.092	Probably a form of synesthesia.
109.66	But it was something
111.084	he later turned to his advantage.
114.676	Where other scientists would play in their laboratory,
118.663	Tesla created his inventions in his mind.
122.798	NT: To my delight, I discovered I could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility.
128.96	MT: And when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination,
133.12	he would build them in his workshop.
135.87	NT: I needed no models, drawings or experiments.
139.642	I could picture them as real in my mind,
143.399	and there I run it, test it and improve it.
146.929	Only then do I construct it.
149.783	MT: His great idea
150.88	was alternating current.
153.031	But how could he convince the public that
155.535	the millions of volts required to make it work were safe?
160.569	To sell his idea,
162.311	he became a showman.
164.895	NT: We are at the dawn of a new age,
170.197	the age of electricity.
172.424	I have been able, through careful invention, to
176.13	transmit, with the mere flick of a switch,
178.59	electricity across the ether.
180.851	It is the magic of science.
184.213	(Applause)
186.79	Tesla has over 700 patents to his name:
192.518	radio, wireless telegraphy,
198.366	remote control, robotics.
205.681	He even photographed the bones of the human body.
211.087	But the high point was the realization of a childhood dream:
215.639	harnessing the raging powers of Niagara Falls,
220.911	and bringing light to the city.
225.407	But Tesla's success didn't last.
232.591	NT: I had bigger ideas.
235.064	Illuminating the city was only the beginning.
238.246	A world telegraphy center -- imagine news,
242.99	messages, sounds, images delivered to
246.937	any point in the world
248.59	instantly and wirelessly.
252.543	MT: It's a great idea; it was a huge project. Expensive, too.
257.035	NT: They wouldn't give me the money.
259.69	MT: Well, maybe you shouldn't have told them it could be used to contact other planets.
262.928	NT: Yes, that was a big mistake.
267.151	MT: Tesla's career as an inventor never recovered.
271.369	He became a recluse.
273.225	Dodged by death,
275.025	he spent much of his time
276.769	in his suite at the Waldorf-Astoria.
279.697	NT: Everything I did, I did for mankind,
285.105	for a world where there would be no humiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich,
292.024	where products of intellect, science and art
295.904	will serve society for the betterment and beautification of life.
301.877	MT: Nikola Tesla died on the 7th of
301.877	January, 1943.
307.757	His final resting place
309.906	is a golden globe that contains his ashes
313.37	at the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade.
316.69	His legacy is with us still.
320.203	Tesla became the man who lit the world,
324.415	but this was only the beginning.
326.775	Tesla's insight was profound.
330.159	NT: Tell me, what will man do when the forests disappear,
335.078	and the coal deposits are exhausted?
338.655	MT: Tesla thought he had the answer.
341.135	We are still asking the question.
348.346	Thank you.
350.56	(Applause)
