15.285	So a few weeks ago, a friend
17.982	of mine gave this toy car to his
20.236	8-year-old son.
21.847	But instead of going into a store and buying one,
24.668	like we do normally, he went to this
27.463	website and he downloaded
29.378	a file, and then he printed it
31.547	on this printer.
33.402	So this idea that you can
35.381	manufacture objects
37.328	digitally using these machines
38.891	is something that The Economist magazine
40.569	defined as the Third Industrial Revolution.
43.199	Actually, I argue that there is another revolution
47.042	going on, and it's the one that has to do with
49.64	open-source hardware and the maker's movement,
52.168	because the printer that my friend used
55.927	to print the toy is actually open-source.
58.544	So you go to the same website, you can download all the files
62.037	that you need in order to make that printer:
65.794	the construction files, the hardware, the software,
69.306	all the instruction is there.
72.115	And also this is part of a large
74.235	community where there are thousands of people
76.835	around the world that are actually
78.795	making these kinds of printers,
80.338	and there's a lot of innovation
81.81	happening because it's all open-source.
83.724	You don't need anybody's permission to create something great.
87.612	And that space is like
89.973	the personal computer in 1976,
92.769	like the Apples with the other companies are fighting,
95.127	and we will see in a few years,
97.508	there will be the Apple of this kind of market come out.
100.641	Well, there's also another interesting thing.
104.444	I said the electronics are open-source, because at the heart
106.408	of this printer there is something I'm really attached to:
109.389	these Arduino boards, the motherboard that sort of
112.34	powers this printer, is a project
114.547	I've been working on for the past seven years.
116.97	It's an open-source project.
118.531	I worked with these friends of mine that I have here.
121.552	So the five of us, two Americans, two Italians
124.206	and a Spaniard, we — (Laughter)
127.187	You know, it's a worldwide project. (Laughter)
130.262	So we came together in this
132.131	design institute called the Interaction Design Institute
134.754	Ivrea, which was teaching
136.903	interaction design, this idea that you can take
139.201	design from the simple shape
141.752	of an object and you can move it
143.529	forward to design the way you interact with things.
145.581	Well, when you design an object that's supposed to interact
148.473	with a human being, if you make a foam model
150.281	of a mobile phone, it doesn't make any sense.
153.104	You have to have something that
154.61	actually interacts with people.
157.117	So, we worked on Arduino and
160.236	a lot of other projects there to
162.052	create platforms that would be
163.953	simple for our students to use,
166.137	so that our students could just build things that worked,
168.598	but they don't have five years to become an electronics engineer. We have one month.
172.656	So how do I make something that even a kid can use?
175.311	And actually, with Arduino,
178.212	we have kids like Sylvia that you see here,
180.635	that actually make projects with Arduino.
182.507	I have 11-year-old kids stop me and show me
185.115	stuff they built for Arduino that's really
187.934	scary to see the capabilities
189.675	that kids have when you give them the tools.
192.098	So let's look at what happens when you make a tool
195.078	that anybody can just pick up and build something quickly,
197.925	so one of the examples that I like to sort of
199.793	kick off this discussion is this
201.707	example of this cat feeder.
203.437	The gentleman who made this project had two cats.
206.004	One was sick and the other one
207.738	was healthy, so he had to make
210.116	sure they ate the proper food.
211.804	So he made this thing that recognizes the cat
213.963	from a chip mounted inside
216.1	on the collar of the cat, and opens the door
218.82	and the cat can eat the food.
220.564	This is made by recycling an old CD player
222.354	that you can get from an old computer,
224.567	some cardboard, tape, couple of sensors, a few blinking LEDs,
228.023	and then suddenly you have a tool. You build something
230.811	that you cannot find on the market.
232.748	"And I like this phrase: ""Scratch your own itch."""
235.512	If you have an idea, you just go and you make it.
238.107	This is the equivalent of sketching on paper
240.056	done with electronics.
242.628	So one of the features that I
244.376	think is important about our work
246.204	is that our hardware, on top of
248.976	being made with love in Italy —
251.166	as you can see from the
252.919	back of the circuit — (Laughter)
254.948	is that it's open,
256.788	so we publish all the design
258.756	files for the circuit online,
260.484	so you can download it and
262.467	you can actually use it to
264.307	make something, or to modify, to learn.
266.94	You know, when I was learning about programming,
268.209	I learned by looking at other people's code,
270.086	or looking at other people's circuits in magazines.
273.515	And this is a good way to learn,
275.731	by looking at other people's work.
277.972	So the different elements of the project are all open,
280.564	so the hardware is released
282.267	with a Creative Commons license.
284.331	So, you know, I like this idea that hardware becomes
286.357	like a piece of culture that you share
288.496	and you build upon, like it was
290.455	a song or a poem with Creative Commons.
294.092	Or, the software is GPL, so it's open-source as well.
296.768	The documentation and the hands-on teaching
300.195	methodology is also open-source and released as the Creative Commons.
303.778	Just the name is protected so
305.781	that we can make sure that we can tell people
308.527	what is Arduino and what isn't.
311.167	Now, Arduino itself is made of
312.839	a lot of different open-source components
315.079	that maybe individually are hard to use for
317.83	a 12-year-old kid, so Arduino
319.937	wraps everything together into
321.79	a mashup of open-source technologies
324.056	where we try to give them the
325.928	best user experience to get something done quickly.
328.135	So you have situations like this,
331.006	where some people in Chile
332.944	decided to make their own boards instead of buying them,
335.742	to organize a workshop and
337.667	to save money. Or there are
340.767	companies that make their own
342.712	variations of Arduino that fit
344.481	in a certain market, and there's
346.232	probably, maybe like a 150 of them
348.945	or something at the moment.
350.737	This one is made by a company
352.625	called Adafruit, which is run by
354.569	this woman called Limor Fried,
356.881	also known as Ladyada, who is
358.488	one of the heroes of the open-source hardware movement
361.209	and the maker movement.
362.743	So, this idea that you have a new, sort of
365.697	turbo-charged DIY community
368.481	that believes in open-source,
370.161	in collaboration, collaborates
372.361	online, collaborates in different spaces.
374.802	There is this magazine called Make that sort of gathered
377.924	all these people and sort of put them together
379.464	as a community, and you see
381.896	a very technical project explained in a
383.924	very simple language, beautifully typeset.
386.781	Or you have websites,
388.349	like this one, like Instructables,
390.61	where people actually teach each other about anything.
392.614	So this one is about Arduino projects,
394.359	the page you see on the screen, but effectively here you can
397.92	learn how to make a cake and everything else.
400.498	So let's look at some projects.
403.298	So this one is a quadcopter.
404.914	It's a small model helicopter.
406.629	In a way, it's a toy, no?
408.899	And so this one was military technology
411.192	a few years ago, and now it's
413.113	open-source, easy to use, you can buy it online.
415.755	DIY Drones is the community; they do this thing called ArduCopter.
419.673	But then somebody actually launched this start-up called
422.686	Matternet, where they figured out that you could
424.879	use this to actually transport
427.177	things from one village to another in Africa,
429.61	and the fact that this was easy to find,
431.178	open-source, easy to hack, enabled them
433.79	to prototype their company really quickly.
435.928	Or, other projects. Matt Richardson: I'm getting a little sick
438.617	of hearing about the same people on TV over and over and over
441.873	again, so I decided to do something about it.
445.083	This Arduino project,
446.497	which I call the Enough Already, will mute the TV anytime
449.872	any of these over-exposed
451.847	personalities is mentioned. (Laughter)
453.079	I'll show you how I made it. (Applause)
457.927	MB: Check this out.
459.751	MR: Our producers caught up with Kim Kardashian earlier
461.708	today to find out what she was planning on wearing to her —
464.611	MB: Eh? (Laughter)
466.002	MR: It should do a pretty good
467.904	job of protecting our ears from having to hear about the details
469.571	of Kim Kardashian's wedding.
471.367	MB: Okay. So, you know, again, what is interesting here
475.924	is that Matt found this module
478.894	that lets Arduino process
481.126	TV signals, he found some code
483.015	written by somebody else that generates infrared signals for the TV,
485.844	put it together and then created this great project.
488.194	It's also used, Arduino's used,
490.246	in serious places like, you know, the Large Hadron Collider.
493.146	There's some Arduino balls collecting data and sort of
495.855	measuring some parameters.
497.655	Or it's used for —
499.974	(Music)
510.686	So this is a musical interface
513.127	built by a student from Italy,
515.246	and he's now turning this into
517.366	a product. Because it was a
519.224	student project becoming a product.
521.455	Or it can be used to make an assistive device.
523.399	This is a glove that understands
525.389	the sign language and transforms
527.536	the gestures you make into sounds
529.735	and writes the words that you're signing on a display
533.051	And again, this is made of all different parts you can find
534.397	on all the websites that sell Arduino-compatible parts,
537.346	and you assemble it into a project.
539.43	Or this is a project from the ITP part of NYU,
542.751	where they met with this boy
544.478	who has a severe disability, cannot play with the PS3,
547.496	so they built this device that
549.439	allows the kid to play baseball
551.886	although he has limited
553.783	movement capability.
556.159	Or you can find it in arts projects.
558.309	So this is the txtBomber.
560.624	So you put a message into this device
562.261	and then you roll it on the wall, and it basically
565.104	has all these solenoids
567.006	pressing the buttons on spray cans,
568.798	so you just pull it over a wall
570.434	and it just writes on the wall
572.161	all the political messages.
574.623	So, yeah. (Applause)
577.254	Then we have this plant here.
579.294	This is called Botanicalls,
581.184	because there's an Arduino ball with a Wi-Fi module
584.379	in the plant, and it's measuring
586.98	the well-being of the plant,
588.495	and it's creating a Twitter account
590.485	where you can actually interact with the plant. (Laughter)
594.014	So, you know, this plant
595.944	"will start to say, ""This is really hot,"" or"
598.423	"there's a lot of, you know, ""I need water right now."" (Laughter)"
602.494	So it just gives a personality to your plant.
605.917	Or this is something that twitters when the
608.584	baby inside the belly of a
610.55	pregnant woman kicks. (Laughter)
613.158	Or this is a 14-year-old kid in
614.749	Chile who made a system that
616.869	detects earthquakes and publishes on Twitter.
619.193	He has 280,000 followers.
621.681	He's 14 and he anticipated
623.825	a governmental project by one year. (Applause)
627.464	Or again, another project where,
631.205	by analyzing the Twitter feed
632.951	of a family, you can basically
634.887	"point where they are, like in the ""Harry Potter"" movie."
637.629	So you can find out everything about this project on the website.
640.445	Or somebody made a chair that twitters when somebody farts. (Laughter)
645.126	It's interesting how, in 2009,
648.209	Gizmodo basically defined,
650.591	said that this project actually gives a meaning to Twitter,
653.354	so it was — a lot changed in between. (Laughter)
656.615	So very serious project.
658.059	When the Fukushima disaster happened,
660.266	a bunch of people in Japan, they realized that the information
663.268	that the government was giving wasn't really open
665.823	and really reliable, so they built
667.573	this Geiger counter, plus Arduino, plus network
670.349	interface. They made 100
672.281	of them and gave them to people around Japan, and essentially
675.859	the data that they gathered gets published on this website
678.119	called Cosm, another website
680.268	they built, so you can actually get reliable real-time
683.909	information from the field,
685.734	and you can get unbiased information.
689.341	Or this machine here, it's from
691.224	the DIY bio movement,
693.664	and it's one of the steps that you need in order to process DNA,
695.988	and again, it's completely open-source from the ground up.
699.366	Or you have students in developing countries making
702.76	replicas of scientific instruments that cost
705.749	a lot of money to make.
707.66	Actually they just build them themselves for a lot less
710.25	using Arduino and a few parts.
711.483	This is a pH probe.
713.379	Or you get kids, like these kids, they're from Spain.
716.777	They learned how to program and to make robots when they
719.641	were probably, like, 11, and then they started to use Arduino
722.31	to make these robots that play football. They became
724.303	world champions by making an Arduino-based robot.
727.145	And so when we had to make
729.021	our own educational robot, we just went to them and said,
731.833	"you know, ""You design it, because you know exactly"
734.181	"what is needed to make a great robot that excites kids."""
737.911	Not me. I'm an old guy.
739.587	What am I supposed to excite, huh? (Laughter)
742.123	But as I — in terms of educational assets. (Laughter)
746.058	There's also companies like Google
747.956	that are using the technology
749.907	to create interfaces between
752.781	mobile phones, tablets and the real world.
756.174	So the Accessory Development Kit
757.194	from Google is open-source
759.246	and based on Arduino, as opposed
760.628	to the one from Apple which is
762.285	closed-source, NDA, sign your
764.789	life to Apple. Here you are.
767.354	There's a giant maze, and Joey's sitting there, and the
769.934	maze is moving when you tilt the tablet.
774.118	Also, I come from Italy, and the design is important
777.09	in Italy, and yet very conservative.
779.437	So we worked with a design
780.854	studio called Habits, in Milan,
783.02	to make this mirror, which is completely open-source.
785.708	This doubles also as an iPod speaker.
788.893	So the idea is that the hardware, the software,
792.53	the design of the object, the fabrication,
793.998	everything about this project is open-source
796.483	and you can make it yourself.
798.353	So we want other designers to pick this up and learn how
800.707	to make great devices, to learn
803.318	how to make interactive products
804.996	by starting from something real.
807.765	But when you have this idea,
810.166	you know, what happens to all these ideas?
812.079	There's, like, thousands of ideas that I —
813.957	You know, it would take seven hours for me to do
816.117	all the presentations.
817.997	I will not take all the seven hours. Thank you.
821.045	But let's start from this example:
823.061	So, the group of people
824.989	that started this company called Pebble, they prototyped
827.4	a watch that communicates via Bluetooth with your phone,
831.092	and you can display information
832.628	on it. And they prototyped with
834.9	an old LCD screen from a Nokia
836.845	mobile phone and an Arduino.
839.253	And then, when they had a final
841.086	project, they actually went to Kickstarter
843.494	and they were asking for 100,000 dollars to make
846.113	a few of them to sell.
847.968	They got 10 million dollars.
850.039	They got a completely
851.574	fully funded start-up, and they don't have to,
854.287	you know, get VCs involved or anything,
856.139	just excite the people with their great project.
859.007	The last project I want to show you is this:
861.291	It's called ArduSat. It's currently on Kickstarter,
865.029	so if you want to contribute, please do it.
867.336	It's a satellite that goes into space, which is probably
870.146	the least open-source thing you can imagine,
872.068	and it contains an Arduino
874.119	connected to a bunch of sensors. So if you know how to use Arduino,
877.229	you can actually upload your experiments
879.685	into this satellite and run them.
881.876	So imagine, if you as a high school can have the satellite
884.512	for a week and do satellite
886.861	space experiments like that.
889.513	So, as I said, there's
892.269	lots of examples, and I'm going to stop here. And I just
893.828	want to thank the Arduino community
896.344	for being the best, and just
898.014	every day making lots of projects.
900.206	Thank you. (Applause)
903.67	(Applause)
905.997	And thanks to the community.
908.484	Chris Anderson: Massimo,
910.457	you told me earlier today that you had no idea, of course,
913.062	that it would take off like this.
914.534	MB: No.
915.323	CA: I mean, how must you feel when you read this stuff and you
917.119	see what you've unlocked?
919.62	MB: Well, it's the work of a lot of people, so we as a community
922.439	are enabling people to make
924.233	great stuff, and I just feel overwhelmed.
926.735	It's just, it's difficult to describe this.
928.904	Every morning, I wake up and I look at all the stuff that
930.918	Google Alerts sends me, and it's
933.104	just amazing. It's just
934.639	going into every field that you can imagine.
937.312	CA: Thank you so much. (Applause)
939.304	(Applause)
