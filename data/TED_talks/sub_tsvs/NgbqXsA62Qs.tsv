16.26	"""When the crisis came,"
18.521	the serious limitations
18.521	of existing economic and financial models
23.231	"immediately became apparent."""
27.455	"""There is also a strong belief,"
27.455	which I share,
31.633	that bad or oversimplistic
31.633	and overconfident economics
36.621	"helped create the crisis."""
38.55	Now, you've probably all heard
38.55	of similar criticism
41.131	coming from people
41.131	who are skeptical of capitalism.
44.806	But this is different.
46.001	This is coming from the heart of finance.
49.704	The first quote
49.704	is from Jean-Claude Trichet
52.628	when he was governor
52.628	of the European Central Bank.
56.44	The second quote is from the head
56.44	of the UK Financial Services Authority.
62.275	Are these people implying
63.846	that we don't understand
63.846	the economic systems
66.61	that drive our modern societies?
69.779	It gets worse.
71.704	"""We spend billions of dollars"
73.917	trying to understand
73.917	the origins of the universe,
77.903	while we still don't understand
77.903	the conditions for a stable society,
83.797	"a functioning economy, or peace."""
89.437	What's happening here?
89.437	How can this be possible?
92.233	Do we really understand more
92.233	about the fabric of reality
95.504	than we do about the fabric
95.504	which emerges from our human interactions?
99.99	Unfortunately, the answer is yes.
102.517	But there's an intriguing solution
105.258	which is coming from what is known
105.258	as the science of complexity.
111.045	To explain what this means
111.045	and what this thing is,
113.756	please let me quickly take
113.756	a couple of steps back.
117.231	I ended up in physics by accident.
119.473	It was a random encounter
119.473	when I was young,
122.611	and since then, I've often wondered
122.611	about the amazing success of physics
127.229	in describing the reality
127.229	we wake up in every day.
131.401	In a nutshell, you can think
131.401	of physics as follows.
134.164	So you take a chunk of reality
134.164	you want to understand
137.782	and you translate it into mathematics.
141.411	You encode it into equations.
144.402	Then, predictions can be made and tested.
148.384	We're actually
148.384	really lucky that this works,
150.896	because no one really knows
150.896	why the thoughts in our heads
153.808	should actually relate to the fundamental
153.808	workings of the universe.
159.538	Despite the success,
159.538	physics has its limits.
162.948	As Dirk Helbing pointed out
162.948	in the last quote,
166.022	we don't really understand the complexity
166.022	that relates to us, that surrounds us.
171.861	This paradox is what got me interested
171.861	in complex systems.
175.989	So these are systems which are made up
177.889	of many interconnected
177.889	or interacting parts:
181.373	swarms of birds or fish,
184.206	ant colonies, ecosystems,
184.206	brains, financial markets.
188.781	These are just a few examples.
192.947	Interestingly, complex systems
192.947	are very hard to map
198.19	into mathematical equations,
200.213	so the usual physics approach
200.213	doesn't really work here.
204.543	So what do we know about complex systems?
206.736	Well, it turns out that what looks
206.736	like complex behavior from the outside
212.792	is actually the result
212.792	of a few simple rules of interaction.
218.255	This means you can forget
218.255	about the equations
222.119	and just start to understand the system
224.869	by looking at the interactions,
226.612	so you can actually forget
226.612	about the equations
229.006	and you just start to look
229.006	at the interactions.
231.582	And it gets even better,
231.582	because most complex systems
234.94	have this amazing property
234.94	called emergence.
237.958	So this means that the system as a whole
237.958	suddenly starts to show a behavior
242.173	which cannot be understood or predicted
245.069	by looking at the components
245.069	of the system.
247.646	So the whole is literally
247.646	more than the sum of its parts.
251.919	And all of this also means
253.217	that you can forget about
253.217	the individual parts of the system,
258.105	how complex they are.
259.45	So if it's a cell or a termite or a bird,
264.462	you just focus on the rules
264.462	of interaction.
269.21	As a result, networks are ideal
269.21	representations of complex systems.
276.362	The nodes in the network
276.362	are the system's components,
282.109	and the links are given
282.109	by the interactions.
285.874	So what equations are for physics,
288.177	complex networks are for the study
288.177	of complex systems.
292.924	This approach has been
292.924	very successfully applied
296.158	to many complex systems
296.158	in physics, biology,
299.776	computer science, the social sciences,
302.52	but what about economics?
304.817	Where are economic networks?
307.373	This is a surprising
307.373	and prominent gap in the literature.
312.243	The study we published last year, called
312.243	"""The Network of Global Corporate Control,"""
318.097	was the first extensive analysis
318.097	of economic networks.
323.914	The study went viral on the Internet
326.5	and it attracted a lot of attention
326.5	from the international media.
331.506	This is quite remarkable, because, again,
331.506	why did no one look at this before?
335.749	Similar data has been
335.749	around for quite some time.
338.832	What we looked at in detail
338.832	was ownership networks.
344.33	So here the nodes are companies,
344.33	people, governments, foundations, etc.
351.384	And the links represent
351.384	the shareholding relations,
354.292	so shareholder A has x percent
354.292	of the shares in company B.
359.48	And we also assign a value to the company
359.48	given by the operating revenue.
365.038	So ownership networks reveal the patterns
365.038	of shareholding relations.
371.305	In this little example,
371.305	you can see a few financial institutions
375.454	with some of the many links highlighted.
379.105	Now, you may think that no one
379.105	looked at this before
381.974	because ownership networks
381.974	are really, really boring to study.
387.201	Well, as ownership is related to control,
391.291	as I shall explain later,
392.848	looking at ownership networks
394.289	actually can give you
394.289	answers to questions like,
396.991	who are the key players?
398.464	How are they organized?
398.464	Are they isolated?
400.814	Are they interconnected?
402.483	And what is the overall
402.483	distribution of control?
406.413	In other words, who controls the world?
409.675	I think this is an interesting question.
412.041	And it has implications for systemic risk.
416.608	This is a measure of how vulnerable
416.608	a system is overall.
422.122	A high degree of interconnectivity
422.122	can be bad for stability,
426.784	because then the stress can spread
426.784	through the system like an epidemic.
433.592	Scientists have sometimes
433.592	criticized economists
436.149	who believe ideas and concepts
436.149	are more important than empirical data,
441.68	because a foundational
441.68	guideline in science is:
445.218	Let the data speak. OK. Let's do that.
447.875	So we started with a database containing
454.841	This is a lot of data,
454.841	and because we wanted to find out
458.152	"""who rules the world,"""
460.284	we decided to focus
460.284	on transnational corporations,
463.712	"or ""TNCs,"" for short."
465.06	These are companies that operate
465.06	in more than one country,
468.656	and we found 43,000.
472.408	In the next step, we built
472.408	the network around these companies,
475.393	so we took all the TNCs' shareholders,
477.773	and the shareholders' shareholders, etc.,
479.756	all the way upstream,
479.756	and we did the same downstream,
482.632	and ended up with a network
482.632	containing 600,000 nodes
486.784	and one million links.
488.57	This is the TNC network which we analyzed.
492.511	And it turns out to be
492.511	structured as follows.
494.644	So you have a periphery and a center
497.195	which contains about 75 percent
497.195	of all the players,
502.199	and in the center,
502.199	there's this tiny but dominant core
506.274	which is made up of highly
506.274	interconnected companies.
510.376	To give you a better picture,
512.666	think about a metropolitan area.
514.331	So you have the suburbs and the periphery,
516.361	you have a center,
516.361	like a financial district,
519.218	then the core will be something like
520.968	the tallest high-rise building
520.968	in the center.
524.992	And we already see signs
524.992	of organization going on here.
	are in the core only,
534.848	but they make up 95 percent of the total
534.848	operating revenue of all TNCs.
542.014	OK, so now we analyzed the structure,
544.64	so how does this relate to the control?
548.777	Well, ownership gives
548.777	voting rights to shareholders.
552.447	This is the normal notion of control.
555.221	And there are different models
556.713	which allow you to compute
556.713	the control you get from ownership.
561.178	If you have more than 50 percent
561.178	of the shares in a company,
564.026	you get control,
565.375	but usually, it depends
565.375	on the relative distribution of shares.
570.352	And the network really matters.
573.575	About 10 years ago, Mr. Tronchetti Provera
576.524	had ownership and control
576.524	in a small company,
579.959	which had ownership and control
579.959	in a bigger company.
583.146	You get the idea.
584.714	This ended up giving him control
584.714	in Telecom Italia with a leverage of 26.
591.75	So this means that,
591.75	with each euro he invested,
595.047	he was able to move 26 euros
595.047	of market value
599.015	through the chain of ownership relations.
602.435	Now what we actually computed in our study
602.435	was the control over the TNCs' value.
609.295	This allowed us to assign
609.295	a degree of influence to each shareholder.
615.025	This is very much in the sense
615.025	of Max Weber's idea of potential power,
620.124	which is the probability
620.124	of imposing one's own will
623.615	despite the opposition of others.
627.666	If you want to compute the flow
627.666	in an ownership network,
632.447	this is what you have to do.
633.828	It's actually not that hard to understand.
636.046	Let me explain by giving you this analogy.
639.077	So think about water flowing in pipes,
639.077	where the pipes have different thickness.
644.851	So similarly, the control is flowing
644.851	in the ownership networks
650.229	and is accumulating at the nodes.
654.333	So what did we find after computing
654.333	all this network control?
658.385	Well, it turns out
658.385	that the 737 top shareholders
663.77	have the potential to collectively control
670.988	Now remember, we started out
670.988	with 600,000 nodes,
673.717	so these 737 top players
673.717	make up a bit more than 0.1 percent.
681.434	They're mostly financial institutions
681.434	in the US and the UK.
686.345	And it gets even more extreme.
689.312	There are 146 top players in the core,
694.239	and they together have the potential
694.239	to collectively control
703.341	What should you take home
703.341	from all of this?
705.639	Well, the high degree of control you saw
705.639	is very extreme by any standard.
714.545	The high degree of interconnectivity
714.545	of the top players in the core
719.527	could pose a significant systemic risk
719.527	to the global economy.
725.22	And we could easily
725.22	reproduce the TNC network
727.726	with a few simple rules.
730.026	This means that its structure is probably
730.026	the result of self-organization.
734.09	It's an emergent property which depends
734.09	on the rules of interaction in the system,
739.957	so it's probably not the result
739.957	of a top-down approach
743.796	like a global conspiracy.
747.359	"Our study ""is an impression"
747.359	of the moon's surface.
749.982	"It's not a street map."""
751.315	So you should take the exact numbers
751.315	in our study with a grain of salt,
755.149	"yet it ""gave us a tantalizing glimpse"
755.149	"of a brave new world of finance."""
763.448	We hope to have opened the door
763.448	for more such research in this direction,
767.501	so the remaining unknown terrain
767.501	will be charted in the future.
772.296	And this is slowly starting.
773.901	We're seeing the emergence of long-term
773.901	and highly-funded programs
779.016	which aim at understanding
779.016	our networked world
782.667	from a complexity point of view.
785.121	But this journey has only just begun,
786.943	so we will have to wait
786.943	before we see the first results.
792.67	Now there is still
792.67	a big problem, in my opinion.
796.801	Ideas relating to finance,
796.801	economics, politics, society,
802.75	are very often tainted
802.75	by people's personal ideologies.
808.708	I really hope that this
808.708	complexity perspective
812.857	allows for some common ground to be found.
818.237	It would be really great
818.237	if it has the power
820.498	to help end the gridlock
820.498	created by conflicting ideas,
825.651	which appears to be paralyzing
825.651	our globalized world.
830.832	Reality is so complex,
830.832	we need to move away from dogma.
835.62	But this is just my own personal ideology.
838.201	Thank you.
839.376	(Applause)
