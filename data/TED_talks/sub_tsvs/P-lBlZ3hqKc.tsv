12.637	Democracy is in trouble, no question about that,
16.14	and it comes in part from a deep dilemma
19.398	in which it is embedded.
22.07	It's increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions
25.817	we face that have to do with global pandemics,
29.342	a cross-border problem;
31.451	with HIV, a transnational problem;
34.874	with markets and immigration,
36.949	something that goes beyond national borders;
39.503	with terrorism, with war,
41.776	all now cross-border problems.
44.423	In fact, we live in a 21st-century world
48.178	of interdependence,
50.383	and brutal interdependent problems,
53.906	and when we look for solutions in politics and in democracy,
59.55	we are faced with political institutions
62.738	designed 400 years ago,
66.191	autonomous, sovereign nation-states
70.669	with jurisdictions and territories
73.231	separate from one another,
74.99	each claiming to be able to solve the problem
77.923	of its own people.
79.996	Twenty-first-century, transnational world
83.292	of problems and challenges,
89.01	In that dilemma lies the central problem of democracy.
95.39	And like many others, I've been thinking about
97.236	what can one do about this, this asymmetry
100.704	between 21st-century challenges
102.697	and archaic and increasingly dysfunctional
106.752	political institutions like nation-states.
110.251	And my suggestion is
111.955	that we change the subject,
115.576	that we stop talking about nations,
119.688	about bordered states,
121.104	and we start talking about cities.
125.071	Because I think you will find, when we talk about cities,
128.429	we are talking about the political institutions
132.486	in which civilization and culture were born.
135.307	We are talking about the cradle of democracy.
138.472	We are talking about the venues in which
141.03	those public spaces where we come together
144.243	to create democracy, and at the same time
148.31	protest those who would take our freedom, take place.
153.273	Think of some great names:
155.907	the Place de la Bastille,
158.6	Zuccotti Park,
160.567	Tahrir Square,
162.733	Taksim Square in today's headlines in Istanbul,
167.039	or, yes,
169.399	Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
172.191	(Applause)
173.897	Those are the public spaces
176.823	where we announce ourselves as citizens,
180.188	as participants, as people with the right
183.634	to write our own narratives.
187.909	Cities are not only the oldest of institutions,
190.587	they're the most enduring.
192.555	If you think about it,
194.727	Constantinople, Istanbul, much older than Turkey.
198.696	Alexandria, much older than Egypt.
201.806	Rome, far older than Italy.
205.756	Cities endure the ages.
209.364	They are the places where we are born,
214.147	grow up, are educated, work, marry,
218.483	pray, play, get old, and in time, die.
223.342	They are home.
225.47	Very different than nation-states,
227.526	which are abstractions.
228.867	We pay taxes, we vote occasionally,
232.989	we watch the men and women we choose rule
236.364	rule more or less without us.
239.588	Not so in those homes known as our towns
243.896	and cities where we live.
245.695	Moreover, today, more than half of the world's population
250.744	live in cities.
252.751	In the developed world, it's about 78 percent.
256.723	More than three out of four people
258.718	live in urban institutions, urban places,
262.758	in cities today.
264.366	So cities are where the action is.
267.142	Cities are us. Aristotle said in the ancient world,
270.258	man is a political animal.
273.839	I say we are an urban animal.
276.866	We are an urban species, at home in our cities.
281.731	So to come back to the dilemma,
283.883	if the dilemma is we have old-fashioned
286.401	political nation-states unable to govern the world,
290.185	respond to the global challenges that we face
293.199	like climate change,
295.359	then maybe it's time for mayors to rule the world,
301.401	for mayors and the citizens and the peoples they represent
304.61	to engage in global governance.
310.495	When I say if mayors ruled the world,
312.326	when I first came up with that phrase,
314.594	it occurred to me that actually, they already do.
318.5	There are scores of international, inter-city,
323.298	cross-border institutions, networks of cities
327.56	in which cities are already, quite quietly,
330.605	below the horizon, working together
333.432	to deal with climate change, to deal with security,
336.129	to deal with immigration,
337.517	to deal with all of those tough,
339.176	interdependent problems that we face.
341.982	They have strange names:
345.438	UCLG,
348.808	United Cities and Local Governments;
353.434	ICLEI,
355.234	the International Council for Local Environmental Issues.
360.75	And the list goes on:
361.96	Citynet in Asia; City Protocol, a new organization
365.507	out of Barcelona that is using the web
368.992	to share best practices among countries.
372.069	And then all the things we know a little better,
373.485	the U.S. Conference of Mayors,
374.776	the Mexican Conference of Mayors,
376.812	the European Conference of Mayors.
380.378	Mayors are where this is happening.
385.361	And so the question is,
387.89	how can we create a world
389.644	in which mayors and the citizens they represent
393.259	play a more prominent role?
395.725	Well, to understand that,
398.675	we need to understand why cities are special,
402.473	why mayors are so different
404.368	than prime ministers and presidents,
405.856	because my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister
410.204	are at the opposite ends of a political spectrum.
414.483	To be a prime minister or a president,
416.891	you have to have an ideology,
419.05	you have to have a meta-narrative,
421.112	you have to have a theory of how things work,
423.634	you have to belong to a party.
425.669	Independents, on the whole,
427.226	don't get elected to office.
428.976	But mayors are just the opposite.
431.209	Mayors are pragmatists, they're problem-solvers.
435.658	Their job is to get things done, and if they don't,
437.621	they're out of a job.
440.34	Mayor Nutter of Philadelphia said,
443.078	we could never get away here in Philadelphia
446.66	with the stuff that goes on in Washington,
448.97	the paralysis, the non-action, the inaction.
453.985	Why? Because potholes have to get filled,
458.444	because the trains have to run,
460.343	because kids have to be able to get to school.
463.292	And that's what we have to do,
464.588	and to do that is about pragmatism
467.527	in that deep, American sense,
469.499	reaching outcomes.
471.429	Washington, Beijing, Paris, as world capitals,
477.538	are anything but pragmatic,
480.85	but real city mayors have to be pragmatists.
483.769	They have to get things done,
485.493	they have to put ideology and religion and ethnicity aside
488.89	and draw their cities together.
491.254	We saw this a couple of decades ago
493.924	when Teddy Kollek, the great mayor of Jerusalem
496.999	in the '80s and the '90s,
499.104	was besieged one day in his office
502.407	by religious leaders from all of the backgrounds,
507.07	Christian prelates, rabbis, imams.
509.905	They were arguing with one another
511.404	about access to the holy sites.
513.53	And the squabble went on and on,
515.309	and Kollek listened and listened,
517.151	"and he finally said, ""Gentlemen,"
521.453	spare me your sermons,
523.609	"and I will fix your sewers."""
526.653	(Laughter)
527.674	That's what mayors do.
529.738	They fix sewers, they get the trains running.
533.158	There isn't a left or a right way of doing.
535.706	Boris Johnson in London calls himself an anarcho-Tory.
540.183	Strange term, but in some ways, he is.
542.058	He's a libertarian. He's an anarchist.
544.491	He rides to work on a bike,
545.98	but at the same time, he's in some ways a conservative.
548.827	Bloomberg in New York was a Democrat,
552.067	then he was a Republican,
552.885	and finally he was an Independent, and said
554.722	the party label just gets in the way.
557.143	Luzhkov, 20 years mayor in Moscow,
560.258	though he helped found a party, United Party with Putin,
563.718	in fact refused to be defined by the party
567.014	and finally, in fact, lost his job not under Brezhnev,
570.304	not under Gorbachev, but under Putin,
573.177	who wanted a more faithful party follower.
577.33	So mayors are pragmatists and problem-solvers.
581.444	They get things done.
582.817	But the second thing about mayors
584.226	is they are also what I like to call homeboys,
588.407	or to include the women mayors, homies.
591.047	They're from the neighborhood.
593.71	They're part of the neighborhood. They're known.
595.517	Ed Koch used to wander around New York City
597.792	"saying, ""How am I doing?"""
600.308	Imagine David Cameron
601.963	wandering around the United Kingdom
603.913	"asking, ""How am I doing?"" He wouldn't like the answer."
606.391	Or Putin. Or any national leader.
609.109	He could ask that because he knew New Yorkers
611.121	and they knew him.
612.997	Mayors are usually from the places they govern.
616.863	It's pretty hard to be a carpetbagger and be a mayor.
619.667	You can run for the Senate out of a different state,
621.481	but it's hard to do that as a mayor.
624.407	And as a result, mayors and city councillors
627.491	and local authorities
629.228	have a much higher trust level,
631.479	and this is the third feature about mayors,
634.007	than national governing officials.
636.38	In the United States, we know the pathetic figures:
644.424	and what they do.
645.926	And even with a relatively popular president like Obama,
649.525	the figures for the Presidency run about 40, 45,
652.621	sometimes 50 percent at best.
654.406	The Supreme Court has fallen way down from what it used to be.
657.575	"But when you ask, ""Do you trust your city councillor,"
661.025	"do you trust your mayor?"""
663.201	the rates shoot up to 70, 75, even 80 percent,
668.354	because they're from the neighborhood,
670.499	because the people they work with are their neighbors,
673.416	because, like Mayor Booker in Newark,
676.833	a mayor is likely to get out of his car on the way to work
680.032	and go in and pull people out of a burning building --
682.786	that happened to Mayor Booker --
685.124	or intervene in a mugging in the street as he goes to work
688.065	because he sees it.
689.397	No head of state would be permitted
691.78	by their security details to do it,
693.632	nor be in a position to do it.
695.85	That's the difference, and the difference
697.389	has to do with the character of cities themselves,
699.554	because cities are profoundly multicultural,
706.175	open, participatory, democratic,
710.51	able to work with one another.
713.164	When states face each other,
715.99	China and the U.S., they face each other like this.
720.28	When cities interact, they interact like this.
724.883	China and the U.S., despite the recent
728.19	meta-meeting in California,
730.801	are locked in all kinds of anger, resentment, and rivalry
735.566	for number one.
736.807	We heard more about who will be number one.
739.784	Cities don't worry about number one.
741.935	They have to work together, and they do work together.
744.118	They work together in climate change, for example.
747.729	Organizations like the C40, like ICLEI, which I mentioned,
751.235	have been working together
753.119	many, many years before Copenhagen.
755.309	In Copenhagen, four or five years ago,
761.224	why their sovereignty didn't permit them
763.469	to deal with the grave, grave crisis of climate change,
767.771	but the mayor of Copenhagen had invited
772.769	They came, they stayed, and they found ways
775.829	and are still finding ways to work together,
778.92	city-to-city, and through inter-city organizations.
782.369	Eighty percent of carbon emissions come from cities,
786.146	which means cities are in a position
788.03	to solve the carbon problem, or most of it,
791.238	whether or not the states of which they are a part
794.026	make agreements with one another.
796.084	And they are doing it.
797.332	Los Angeles cleaned up its port,
799.632	which was 40 percent of carbon emissions,
802.207	and as a result got rid of about 20 percent of carbon.
805.988	New York has a program to upgrade its old buildings,
808.972	make them better insulated in the winter,
812.156	to not leak energy in the summer,
814.099	not leak air conditioning. That's having an impact.
817.046	Bogota, where Mayor Mockus,
818.94	when he was mayor, he introduced a transportation system
823.176	that saved energy, that allowed surface buses
827.628	to run in effect like subways,
829.163	express buses with corridors.
831.079	It helped unemployment, because people could get across town,
834.365	and it had a profound impact on climate as well as
838.221	many other things there.
839.292	Singapore, as it developed its high-rises
842.146	and its remarkable public housing,
843.851	also developed an island of parks,
847.344	and if you go there, you'll see how much of it
849.06	is green land and park land.
850.601	Cities are doing this, but not just one by one.
853.109	They are doing it together.
854.694	They are sharing what they do,
858.352	and they are making a difference by shared best practices.
862.321	Bike shares, many of you have heard of it,
863.953	started 20 or 30 years ago in Latin America.
866.256	Now it's in hundreds of cities around the world.
868.6	Pedestrian zones, congestion fees,
871.891	emission limits in cities like California cities have,
875.601	there's lots and lots that cities can do
877.905	even when opaque, stubborn nations refuse to act.
887.265	So what's the bottom line here?
891.233	The bottom line is, we still live politically
894.98	in a world of borders, a world of boundaries,
897.195	a world of walls,
898.793	a world where states refuse to act together.
904.953	Yet we know that the reality we experience
908.746	day to day is a world without borders,
912.943	a world of diseases without borders
915.417	and doctors without borders,
917.717	maladies sans frontières, Médecins Sans Frontières,
922.289	of economics and technology without borders,
928.36	of education without borders,
930.476	of terrorism and war without borders.
933.706	That is the real world, and unless we find a way
936.92	to globalize democracy or democratize globalization,
942.35	we will increasingly not only risk
946.718	the failure to address all of these transnational problems,
950.799	but we will risk losing democracy itself,
954.518	locked up in the old nation-state box,
959.144	unable to address global problems democratically.
964.837	So where does that leave us?
967.831	I'll tell you. The road to global democracy
970.842	doesn't run through states.
972.813	It runs through cities.
975.375	Democracy was born in the ancient polis.
980.175	I believe it can be reborn in the global cosmopolis.
985.683	In that journey from polis to cosmopolis,
989.627	we can rediscover the power
991.898	of democracy on a global level.
994.021	We can create not a League of Nations, which failed,
998.043	but a League of Cities,
999.431	not a United or a dis-United Nations,
1002.543	but United Cities of the World.
1004.801	We can create a global parliament of mayors.
1008.888	That's an idea. It's in my conception of the coming world,
1012.984	but it's also on the table in City Halls
1015.666	in Seoul, Korea, in Amsterdam,
1018.394	in Hamburg, and in New York.
1020.433	Mayors are considering that idea of how you can actually
1023.291	constitute a global parliament of mayors,
1026.45	and I love that idea, because a parliament of mayors
1029.33	is a parliament of citizens
1031.476	and a parliament of citizens is a parliament of us,
1035.371	of you and of me.
1038.502	If ever there were citizens without borders,
1043.292	I think it's the citizens of TED
1045.435	who show the promise to be those citizens without borders.
1048.626	I am ready to reach out and embrace
1053.556	a new global democracy,
1055.882	to take back our democracy.
1058.981	And the only question is,
1061.119	are you?
1063.178	Thank you so much, my fellow citizens.
1065.161	(Applause)
1076.351	Thank you. (Applause)
