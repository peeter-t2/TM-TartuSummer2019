27	Kurt Andersen: Like many architects, David is a hog for the limelight
30	but is sufficiently reticent -- or at least pretends to be --
33	that he asked me to question him rather than speaking.
38	In fact what we're going to talk about,
40	I think, is in fact a subject that is probably better served
48	by a conversation than an address.
49	And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede.
58	Dan Rather: Since the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center,
62	many people have flocked to downtown New York to see
64	and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground.
69	Now, as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports, they're putting the finishing touches
73	on a new way for people to visit and view the scene.
76	Jim Axelrod: Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty.
80	There's a new place in New York
82	where the crowds are thickest -- Ground Zero.
84	Tourist: I've taken my step-daughter here from Indianapolis.
88	This was -- out of all the tourist sites in New York City --
92	this was her number-one pick.
93	JA: Thousands now line up on lower Broadway.
96	Tourist: I've been wanting to come down here since this happened.
101	JA: Even on the coldest winter days.
103	To honor and remember.
106	Tourist: It's reality, it's us. It happened here.
108	This is ours.
111	JA: So many, in fact, that seeing has become
113	a bit of a problem.
114	Tourist: I think that people are very frustrated
116	that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on.
119	JA: But that is about to change.
121	In record time,
123	a team of architects and construction workers
125	designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration
131	and bring people closer.
132	Man: They'll get an incredible panorama
135	and understand, I think more completely,
137	the sheer totality of the destruction of the place.
142	JA: If you think about it, Ground Zero is unlike
144	most any other tourist site in America.
146	Unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument,
149	people come here to see what's no longer there.
153	David Rockwell: The first experience people will have here
156	when they see this is not as a construction site
158	but as this incredibly moving burial ground.
161	JA: The walls are bare by design, so people can fill them
164	with their own memorials the way they already have
167	along the current perimeter.
169	Tourist: From our hearts, it affected us just as much.
172	JA: The ramps are made of simple material --
174	the kind of plywood you see at construction sites --
176	which is really the whole point.
178	In the face of America's worst destruction
181	people are building again.
184	Jim Axelrod, CBS News, New York.
187	KA: This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment,
192	but certainly David you are known as -- I know, a phrase you hate --
198	an entertainment architect.
200	Your work is highly sensual, even hedonistic.
206	DR: I like that word.
208	KA: It's about pleasure -- casinos and hotels and restaurants.
215	How did the shock that all of us -- and especially all of us in New York --
218	felt on the 11th of September transmute
223	into your desire to do this thing?
226	DR: Well the truth of the matter is, post-September 11th,
231	I felt myself in the role originally --
233	first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca
236	and whose neighborhood was devastated,
240	and as someone who works less than a mile from there --
243	that I was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me
249	in my firm, to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm
253	about creating the places we had been creating.
255	"In fact we're finishing a book which is called ""Pleasure,"""
259	which is about sensual pleasure in spaces.
262	But I've got to tell you -- it became impossible to do that.
265	We were really paralyzed.
267	And I found myself the Friday after September 11th --
271	two days afterwards --
273	literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything.
276	We gave the office a few days off.
279	And in discussing this with other architects,
283	we had seen people saying in the press
288	that they should rebuild the towers as they were --
291	they should rebuild them 50 stories taller.
294	And I thought it was astonishing to speculate,
297	as if this were a competition,
299	on something that was such a fresh wound.
301	And I had a series of discussions --
305	first with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller, who collaborated with us on this,
309	and several other people --
312	and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something.
316	And that as people who create places, the ultimate way to help
322	wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios,
326	but to help right now.
328	So we tried to come up with a way,
330	as a group, to have a kind of design SWAT team.
332	And that was the mission that we came up with.
336	KA: Were you conscious of suddenly --
338	as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants --
343	suddenly fulfilling needs?
348	DR: Well what I was aware of was,
350	there was this overwhelming need to act now.
352	And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this.
361	There was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero.
366	They moved to an abandoned school.
369	We took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists,
372	and over four days -- it was like this urban barn-raising --
375	to renovate it, and everyone wanted to help.
377	It was just extraordinary.
379	Tom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed
382	and it became this cathartic experience for us.
386	KA: And that was done, effectively,
388	by October 8 or something?
390	DR: Yeah.
392	KA: Obviously, what you faced in trying to do something
395	as substantial as this project -- and this is only one of four
398	that you've designed to surround the site --
401	you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine,
408	entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be
413	in New York real estate and New York politics.
415	DR: Well, it's a funny thing.
417	We finished PS 234, and had dinner with a small group.
420	I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild.
425	And I sat in on several meetings.
427	And there were the most circuitous grand plans
431	that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city.
436	And the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled,
442	and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process.
445	And it wasn't an inclusive group.
447	So we said, what is --
448	KA: It was not an inclusive group?
450	DR: It was not an inclusive group.
452	It was predominantly a white, rich, corporate group
455	that was not representative of the city.
459	KA: Shocking.
461	DR: Yeah, surprising.
463	So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea.
468	The city actually approached us.
472	We first approached the city about Pier 94.
475	We saw how PS 234 worked.
477	The families -- the victims of the families --
479	were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing.
481	KA: On the Hudson River?
483	DR: Yeah. And the city actually -- through Tim Zagat initially,
486	and then through Christyne Nicholas, then we got to Giuliani --
489	"said, ""You know we don't want to do anything with Pier 94 right now,"
492	but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero
495	that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families,
499	"and a way to protect it from the weather."""
501	So I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin,
505	and I've got to say, it was the most moving experience of my life.
510	It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it,
514	where the families of the victims had left notes to them.
517	And there was no mediation between us and the experience.
521	There was no filter.
523	And I remembered on September 11th, on 14th Street,
528	the roof of our building -- we can see the World Trade Towers prominently --
531	and I saw the first building collapse from a conference room
538	on the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up.
540	And then everyone was up on the roof, so I ran up there.
544	And it was amazing how much harder it was
547	to believe in real life than it was on TV.
550	There was something about the comfort of the filter
552	and how much information was between us and the experience.
555	So seeing this in a very simple,
557	dignified way was a very powerful experience.
561	So we went back to the city and said
563	we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform,
566	but we've spent some time down there.
571	At the same time the city had this need.
576	They were looking for a solution
578	to deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day
580	who were going down there, that had nowhere to go.
583	And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site.
586	So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan.
588	There was a way -- there had to be a way --
590	to get people to move around the site.
593	KA: But then you've got to figure out a way --
596	we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits
601	and getting everybody on board -- but simply funding this thing.
604	It looks like a fairly simple thing,
607	but this was a half a million dollar project?
609	DR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded,
611	it wasn't going to happen.
613	And we also, frankly, knew that if it didn't happen
615	by the end of the Giuliani administration,
617	then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT
619	and the Police Department and all of the --
622	we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time,
626	and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management.
629	This incredible act on their part, because they really wanted this,
633	and they sensed that this needed to happen.
635	KA: And there was therefore this ticking clock,
638	because Giuliani was obviously out three months after that.
642	DR: Yeah. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this --
646	we had to work with the families of the victims,
650	through the city, to make sure that they knew this was happening.
653	Because this didn't want to be a surprise.
655	And we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York,
659	because the key was not raising a lot of objection
662	and sort of working as quietly as possible.
667	We came up with the idea of setting up a foundation,
670	mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this,
675	he would not agree to do this, even if we would pay him the money.
681	There needed to be a foundation in place.
682	So we came up with a foundation, and actually what happened was
687	one major developer in New York --
689	KA: Who shall remain nameless, I guess?
691	DR: Yeah. His initials are JS, and he owns Rockefeller Center,
694	if that helps anyone -- volunteered to help.
698	And we met with him.
700	The prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars.
706	And Atlantic-Heydt, who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country,
709	volunteered to do it at cost.
713	"So this developer said, ""You know what, we'll underwrite the entire expense."""
716	"And we said, ""That's incredible!"""
719	And I think this was the 21st,
721	and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th.
723	And we had to start construction the next day.
727	We had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice,
731	and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform
735	about half the size that we had drawn it.
737	KA: Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get
739	the tiny little Stonehenge, I guess?
741	(Laughter)
745	DR: In fact, it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding.
748	There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul --
752	that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified,
756	and a place to reflect and remember.
758	And I've got to say that we spent a lot of time
761	in putting this together, watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul --
764	which is just to the right -- and moving around the site.
766	And I live down there, so we spent a lot of time looking at the need.
770	And I think people were amazed at two things --
774	I think they were amazed at the destruction,
776	but I think there was a sense of disbelief
779	about the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving.
783	Just the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers.
786	So we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said,
791	"""I'm going to lock the door, because this developer"
793	"will not agree to have you leave till you've signed off on this."""
797	"And we said, ""Well, this is half the size,"
799	it doesn't have any of the design features
803	that have been agreed upon by everyone -- everyone in the city.
805	"We'd have to go back to the beginning to do this."""
809	And I convinced him that we should leave the room
812	with the agreement to build it as designed.
816	The next day I got an email from the developer
819	saying that he was withdrawing all funding.
823	So we didn't know what to do,
827	but we decided to cast a very wide net.
829	We emailed out letters to as many people as we could --
832	several people in the audience here -- who were very helpful.
836	KA: There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point?
839	DR: No. In fact I told the contractor to go ahead.
843	He had already ordered materials based on my go-ahead.
845	We knew that one way or another this was going to happen.
848	And we just felt it had to happen.
853	KA: You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation.
859	Richard, I think very correctly,
864	made the point at the beginning --
866	before all the chair designers came out --
870	about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions
875	on this kind of universal, banal, common problem of sitting.
879	It seems to me with this,
883	that it was the opposite of that.
885	This was an unprecedented, singular design problem.
889	DR: Well here's the issue:
891	we knew that this was not in the sense of --
894	we think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial.
902	It was important that this not be categorized as a memorial.
903	That this was a place for people to reflect, to remember --
909	a kind of quiet place.
912	So it led us to using design solutions
916	that created as few filters between the viewer --
919	as we said about the families' platform -- and the experience as possible.
922	It's all incredibly humble material.
925	It's scaffolding and plywood.
929	And it allows -- by sort of the procession of the movement,
933	up by Saint Paul's and down the other side --
936	it gives you about 300 feet to go up 13 feet from the ground
940	to where you get the 360 degree view.
943	But the design was driven by a need to be quick, cheap, safe, respectful, flexible.
951	One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable.
954	Because when we looked at the four platforms around the site,
958	one of which is an upgrade of the families' platform,
961	we knew that these had to be moveable
963	to respond to changing conditions,
965	and the changing definition of what Ground Zero is.
971	KA: Your work -- I mean, we've talked about this before --
974	a lot of your work, I think, is informed by your belief in, or your focus on
980	the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things,
984	"and a kind of ""Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die,"""
988	sort of sense of existence.
991	This is clearly not a work for the ages.
997	You know, a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here.
1001	Did that require, as an architect,
1004	a new way of thinking about what you were doing?
1006	To think of it as this purely temporary installation?
1010	DR: No, I don't think so.
1012	I think this is, obviously, substantially different
1016	from anything we'd ever thought about doing before, just by the nature of it.
1021	Where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is,
1026	number one -- the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done.
1030	And Kevin Kennon, Rick Scofidio, Liz Diller
1035	and all the people within the city --
1040	Norman Lear, who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding,
1045	offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it.
1049	So the notion of collaboration --
1051	I think this reinforces how important that is.
1054	And in terms of the temporary nature of it,
1058	our goal was not to create something
1060	that would be there longer than it needed to be.
1063	I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue
1068	that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city,
1072	about what's really happening there.
1075	And a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address,
1081	where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial.
1084	Which was very controversial, but it resonated with a lot of people.
1087	And I think regardless of what the position is about how
1092	this sacred piece of land is to be used,
1096	having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter,
1101	I think makes it a more powerful dialogue.
1103	And that's what we were interested in.
1105	So that, very much, is in the realm of things
1108	I've been interested in before.
1110	KA: It seems to me, among other things, a lovely piece of civic infrastructure.
1113	It enables that conversation to get serious.
1117	And six months after the fact --
1120	and only a few months away from the site being cleaned --
1124	we are very quickly, now, getting to the point
1126	where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious.
1131	Do you have -- having been as physically involved in the site
1136	as you have been doing this project -- have any ideas about
1138	what should or shouldn't be done?
1140	DR: Well, I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate --
1145	I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan.
1151	The Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings,
1156	which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings.
1160	KA: But it had some really terrible ideas.
1162	DR: And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas,
1166	where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses.
1171	And I think there should be a broader -- which there's starting to be --
1174	the dialogue is really opening up to,
1176	what does this site really want to be?
1178	And I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out,
1182	that it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion.
1185	There's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive,
1190	about depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over,
1194	so that there's one uninterrupted piece of land.
1197	KA: Well, I think that's interesting.
1199	And it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate
1202	to discuss six months ago, but perhaps isn't now,
1204	which is, not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture,
1210	as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza.
1214	Is this an opportunity, is the silver lining --
1217	a silver lining, here -- to rebuild
1219	some more traditional city grid, or not?
1223	DR: I think there's a real opportunity to engage
1225	in a discussion of why we live in cities.
1227	And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people
1231	collide up against us each day?
1233	I don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces,
1238	regardless of what the number is.
1240	So yeah, I think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities.
1244	And in fact, there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven.
1250	KA: Which was the building just north of the Towers?
1252	DR: Right, which the towers fell into.
1254	And the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage
1259	that they're not re-opening the street
1261	to connect that back to the rest of the city.
1263	I think a public dialogue -- I think, you know,
1266	I'd like to see an international competition,
1270	and a call for ideas for uses.
1273	KA: Whether it's arts, whether it's housing,
1275	whether it's what amount of shopping?
1277	DR: Right. And we're looking for other things.
1279	This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help.
1282	Including taking a small piece adjacent to the site
1286	and inviting 10 architects who currently don't have a voice
1290	in New York to do artist housing.
1292	And find other ways to encourage the discussion
1294	to be against sort of monolithic, single solutions,
1297	and more about a multiplicity of things.
1301	KA: Before we end, I know you have a piece of digital video
1308	of the experience of being on this platform?
1311	DR: John Kamen -- who's here, actually -- put together
1314	a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use.
1317	So I thought that would be good to end with.
1332	DR: We're looking from Fulton Street, west.
1338	One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration
1342	was I had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was.
1345	And essentially our structure was designed to be written on.
1352	KA: As you say, it's not a memorial.
1354	But were you conscious of memorials? The Vietnam Memorial?
1356	Those kinds of forms?
1358	DR: We certainly did as much research as we could,
1363	and we were conscious of other memorials.
1367	And also the complexity and length of time they really take to do.
1370	It's 350 people on the committee for Oklahoma City,
1374	which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad-hoc, spontaneous solution
1379	that expanded on Union Square
1382	and the places that were ad-hoc memorials in the city already.
1390	The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable.
1406	What's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed,
1410	so that what you're aware of
1412	is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero,
1417	but all of the buildings around it --
1419	and the scars on the building around it, which are enormous.
1422	This shows Saint Paul's on the left.
1431	KA: I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers
1436	for making this happen and getting this done.
1439	But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection,
1444	and its being there,
1447	almost before you could believe
1450	that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished,
1454	is part of its extraordinary --
1459	I don't know if beauty is the word --
1462	but presence.
1465	DR: It was an honor to do.
1467	And we were thrilled to be able to show it here.
