12.739	So today's top chef class is in how to rob a bank,
16.534	and it's clear that the general public needs guidance,
20.819	because the average bank robbery nets
23.692	only 7,500 dollars.
26.23	Rank amateurs who know nothing
28.2	about how to cook the books.
30.539	The folks who know, of course,
32.599	run our largest banks,
34.39	and in the last go-around,
36.908	they cost us over 11 trillion dollars.
41.144	That's what 11 trillion looks like.
43.561	That's how many zeros?
45.108	And cost us over 10 million jobs as well.
48.544	So our task is to educate ourselves
51.195	so that we can understand
52.403	why we have these recurrent,
54.853	intensifying financial crises,
56.93	and how we can prevent them in the future.
60.125	And the answer to that is
62.515	that we have to stop epidemics of control fraud.
66.921	Control fraud is what happens
68.87	when the people who control,
70.69	typically a CEO,
72.415	a seemingly legitimate entity,
74.988	use it as a weapon to defraud.
77.244	And these are the weapons of mass destruction
80.839	in the financial world.
82.939	They also follow in finance a particular strategy,
87.669	because the weapon of choice in finance
90.041	is accounting,
91.511	and there is a recipe for accounting
95.405	control fraud, and how it occurs.
97.735	And we discovered this recipe
99.368	in quite an odd way that I'll
99.368	come back to in a moment.
102.062	First ingredient in the recipe: grow like crazy;
106.039	second, by making or buying really crappy loans,
111.077	but loans that are made at a very high interest rate
114.56	or yield;
116.038	three, while employing extreme leverage --
118.27	that just means a lot of debt --
119.985	compared to your equity;
121.219	and four, while providing only trivial loss reserves
125.239	against the inevitable losses.
127.423	If you follow those four simple steps,
131.089	and any bank can follow them,
133.39	then you are mathematically guaranteed
135.898	to have three things occur.
138.088	The first thing is
139.648	you will report record bank profits --
143.012	not just high, record.
145.523	Two, the CEO will immediately
145.523	be made incredibly wealthy
150.78	by modern executive compensation.
153.676	And three, farther down the road,
156.546	the bank will suffer catastrophic losses
159.607	and will fail unless it is bailed out.
162.803	And that's a hint as to how
166.543	we discovered this recipe,
168.279	because we discovered it
168.279	through an autopsy process.
172.355	During the savings and loan debacle in 1984,
177.267	we looked at every single failure,
179.722	and we looked for common characteristics,
182.139	and we discovered this recipe was common
186.398	to each of these frauds.
188.712	In other words, a coroner could find these things
191.79	because this is a fatal recipe
194.65	that will destroy the banks
196.074	as well as the economy.
198.165	And it also turns out to be precisely
201.678	what could have stopped this crisis,
203.94	the one that cost us 11 trillion dollars
206.462	just in the household sector,
208.398	that cost us 10 million jobs,
210.502	was the easiest financial crisis by far
213.956	to have avoided completely
216.427	if we had simply learned the lessons
218.499	of epidemics of control fraud,
220.604	particularly using this recipe.
223.095	So let's go to this crisis,
225.002	and the two huge epidemics
227.851	of loan origination fraud that drove the crisis --
231.515	appraisal fraud and liar's loans --
234.348	and what we're going to see
235.793	in looking at both of these is
238.14	we got warnings that were incredibly early
241.393	about these frauds.
243.362	We got warnings that we could
243.362	have taken advantage of easily,
247.5	because back in the savings and loan debacle,
249.97	we had figured out how to respond
252.59	and prevent these crises.
254.668	And three, the warnings were unambiguous.
257.972	They were obvious that what was going on
260.541	was an epidemic of accounting control fraud building up.
265.42	Let's take appraisal fraud first.
267.193	This is simply where you inflate the value
269.901	of the home that is being pledged
272.63	as security for the loan.
275.227	In 2000, the year 2000,
278.733	that is over a year before Enron fails, by the way,
283.067	the honest appraisers got together a formal petition
287.303	begging the federal government to act,
290.405	and the industry to act,
292.26	to stop this epidemic of appraisal fraud.
296.069	And the appraisers explained how it was occurring,
299.373	that banks were demanding that appraisers
303.01	inflate the appraisal,
304.92	and that if the appraisers refused to do so,
308.221	they, the banks, would blacklist
312.077	honest appraisers
314.299	and refuse to use them.
316.851	Now, we've seen this before
319.413	in the savings and loan debacle,
320.941	and we know that this kind of fraud
322.765	can only originate from the lenders,
325.361	and that no honest lender would ever inflate
328.405	the appraisal,
329.714	because it's the great protection against loss.
332.81	So this was an incredibly early warning, 2000.
336.441	It was something we'd seen before,
338.622	and it was completely unambiguous.
340.861	This was an epidemic of accounting control fraud
344.253	led by the banks.
345.85	What about liar's loans?
347.523	Well, that warning actually comes earlier.
351.372	The savings and loan debacle is basically
354.001	the early 1980s through 1993,
357.548	and in the midst of fighting that wave
360.303	of accounting control fraud,
362.97	in 1990, we found that a second front
367.158	of fraud was being started.
369.203	And like all good financial frauds in America,
371.358	it began in Orange County, California.
375.21	And we happened to be the regional regulators for it.
378.221	And our examiners said,
380.01	they are making loans without even checking
383.365	what the borrower's income is.
385.868	This is insane, it has to lead to massive losses,
390.451	and it only makes sense for entities engaged
394.083	in these accounting control frauds.
396.324	And we said, yeah, you're absolutely right,
398.595	and we drove those liar's loans
401.893	out of the industry in 1990 and 1991,
406.337	but we could only deal with the industry
408.389	we had jurisdiction over,
410.438	which was savings and loans,
412.143	and so the biggest and the baddest of the frauds,
415.523	Long Beach Savings, voluntarily gave up
418.429	its federal savings and loan charter,
421.298	gave up federal deposit insurance,
423.741	converted to become a mortgage bank
426	for the sole purpose of escaping our jurisdiction,
429.2	and changed its name to Ameriquest,
431.773	and became the most notorious
433.445	of the liar's loans frauds early on,
437.07	and to add to that,
438.606	they deliberately predated upon minorities.
443.826	So we knew again about this crisis.
447.917	We'd seen it before. We'd stopped it before.
451.151	We had incredibly early warnings of it,
454.341	and it was absolutely unambiguous
456.193	that no honest lender would
456.193	make loans in this fashion.
460.399	So let's take a look at the reaction
463.241	of the industry and the regulators
466.187	and the prosecutors to these clear
468.99	early warnings that could have prevented the crisis.
473.457	Start with the industry.
475.306	The industry responded between 2003 and 2006
481.26	by increasing liar's loans
484.101	by over 500 percent.
489.333	These were the loans
491.228	that hyperinflated the bubble
492.983	and produced the economic crisis.
496.631	By 2006, half of all the loans called subprime
501.482	were also liar's loans.
503.508	They're not mutually exclusive, it's just that together,
506.793	they're the most toxic combination
509.233	you can possibly imagine.
511.093	By 2006, 40 percent of all the loans
514.847	made that year, all the home loans made that year,
517.464	were liar's loans,
521.497	And this is despite a warning
524.201	from the industry's own antifraud experts
527.624	that said that these loans were an open invitation
530.779	to fraudsters,
532.739	and that they had a fraud incidence
534.481	of 90 percent,
536.969	nine zero.
539.661	In response to that, the industry
542.728	first started calling these loans liar's loans,
547.776	which lacks a certain subtlety,
551.345	and second, massively increased them,
554.395	and no government regulator ever
557.656	required or encouraged any lender
561.346	to make a liar's loan
562.642	or anyone to purchase a liar's loan,
565.329	and that explicitly includes Fannie and Freddie.
568.499	This came from the lenders
570.621	because of the fraud recipe.
573.79	What happened to appraisal fraud?
576.224	It expanded remarkably as well.
579.36	By 2007, when a survey of appraisers was done,
586.458	that they had been subject to coercion
588.898	from the lenders trying to get them
591.39	to inflate an appraisal.
592.96	In other words, both forms of fraud
595.95	became absolutely endemic and normal,
599.724	and this is what drove the bubble.
601.953	What happened in the governmental sector?
604.145	Well, the government, as I told you,
606.749	when we were the savings and loan regulators,
609.465	we could only deal with our industry,
612.143	and if people gave up their
612.143	federal deposit insurance,
614.581	we couldn't do anything to them.
616.844	Congress, it may strike you as impossible,
620.173	but actually did something intelligent in 1994,
623.421	and passed the Home Ownership
623.421	and Equity Protection Act
626.974	that gave the Fed, and only the Federal Reserve,
630.227	the explicit, statutory authority to ban liar's loans
634.254	by every lender,
636.36	whether or not they had federal deposit insurance.
639.358	So what did Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan,
642.893	as chairs of the Fed, do
644.86	when they got these warnings
646.766	that these were massively fraudulent loans
649.776	and that they were being sold
649.776	to the secondary market?
653.13	Remember, there's no fraud exorcist.
655.35	Once it starts out a fraudulent loan,
657.398	it can only be sold to the secondary market
659.71	through more frauds,
660.906	lying about the reps and warrantees,
663.454	and then those people are going to produce
665.062	mortgage-backed securities
666.49	and exotic derivatives
667.758	which are also going to be supposedly backed
670.98	by those fraudulent loans.
672.703	So the fraud is going to progress
674.244	through the entire system,
675.708	hyperinflate the bubble, produce a disaster.
678.961	And remember, we had experience with this.
682.262	We had seen significant losses,
684.55	and we had experience of competent regulators
687.996	in stopping it.
689.486	Greenspan and Bernanke refused
692.382	to use the authority under the statute
694.793	to stop liar's loans.
697.11	And this was a matter first of dogma.
699.674	They're just horrifically opposed
702.525	to anything regulatory.
704.344	But it is also the international competition in laxity,
709.06	the race to the bottom
710.344	between the United States and the United Kingdom,
714.379	the city of London, in particular,
715.98	and the city of London won that race to the bottom,
718.95	but it meant that all regulation in the West
722.802	was completely degraded
724.806	in this stupid competition to be
726.89	who could have the weakest regulation.
728.962	So that was the regulatory response.
731.012	What about the response of the prosecutors
734.669	after the crisis,
736.404	after 11 trillion dollars in losses,
740.602	after 10 million jobs lost,
742.642	a crisis in which the losses and the frauds
745.926	were more than 70 times larger
749.381	than the savings and loan debacle?
751.685	Well, in the savings and loan debacle,
753.576	our agency that regulated savings and loans, OTS,
757.546	made over 30,000 criminal referrals,
761.63	produced over 1,000 felony convictions
764.266	just in cases designated as major,
766.94	and that understates the degree of prioritization,
770.078	because we worked with the FBI
771.874	to create the list of the top 100 fraud schemes,
776.138	the absolute worst of the worst, nationwide.
779.402	Roughly 300 savings and loans involved,
782.186	roughly 600 senior officials.
785.5	Virtually all of them were prosecuted.
787.84	We had a 90 percent conviction rate.
790.671	It's the greatest success against
792.501	elite white collar criminals ever,
795.103	and it was because of this understanding
797.339	of control fraud
798.674	and the accounting control fraud mechanism.
801.185	Flash forward to the current crisis.
804.357	The same agency, Office of Thrift Supervision,
806.93	which was supposed to regulate
808.56	many of the largest makers of liar's loans
810.657	in the country,
811.764	has made, even today -- it no longer exists,
816.458	but as of a year ago,
818.266	it had made zero criminal referrals.
823.11	The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
824.806	which is supposed to regulate
824.806	the largest national banks,
827.322	has made zero criminal referrals.
829.873	The Fed appears to have made
831.499	zero criminal referrals.
833.494	The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
835.449	is smart enough to refuse to answer the question.
839.983	Without any guidance from the regulators,
845.518	there's no expertise in the FBI
848.4	to investigate complex frauds.
850.872	It isn't simply that they've had
852.804	to reinvent the wheel
854.626	of how to do these prosecutions;
856.544	they've forgotten that the wheel exists,
861.3	and therefore, we have zero prosecutions,
865.398	and of course, zero convictions,
868	of any of the elite bank frauds,
870.79	the Wall Street types,
872.327	that drove this crisis.
875.459	With no expertise coming from the regulators,
877.696	the FBI formed what it calls a partnership
880.787	with the Mortgage Bankers Association in 2007.
885.11	The Mortgage Bankers Association
886.943	is the trade association of the perps.
890.694	And the Mortgage Bankers Association
893.11	set out, it had the audacity and the success
896.9	to con the FBI.
898.578	It had created a supposed definition
901.655	of mortgage fraud, in which, guess what,
904.53	its members are always the victim
906.392	and never the perpetrators.
908.409	And the FBI has bought this hook, line, sinker,
912.923	rod, reel and the boat they rode out in.
917.004	And so the FBI,
920.06	under the leadership of an attorney general
923.158	who is African-American
924.332	and a president of the United
924.332	States who is African-American,
926.794	have adopted the Tea Party definition of the crisis,
930.294	in which it is the first virgin crisis in history,
933.776	conceived without sin in the executive ranks.
937.454	And it's those oh-so-clever hairdressers
940.85	who were able to defraud the poor, pitiful banks,
944.068	who lack any financial sophistication.
946.452	It is the silliest story you can conceive of,
949.81	and so they go and they prosecute the hairdressers,
953.711	and they leave the banksters alone entirely.
957.89	And so, while lions are roaming the campsite,
960.8	the FBI is chasing mice.
964.01	What do we need to do?
965.44	What can we do in all of this?
967.944	We need to change the perverse incentive structures
971.763	that produce these recurrent epidemics
974.759	of accounting control fraud
976.088	that are driving our crises.
978.102	So we have to first get rid
980.99	of the systemically dangerous institutions.
983.478	These are the so-called too-big-to-fail institutions.
986.963	We need to shrink them to the point,
989.105	within the next five years,
990.7	that they no longer pose a systemic risk.
993.435	Right now, they are ticking time bombs
995.572	that will cause a global crisis
998.915	as soon as the next one fails --
1001.264	not if, when.
1003.06	Second thing we need to do is completely reform
1005.971	modern executive and professional compensation,
1008.963	which is what they use to suborn the appraisers.
1013.306	Remember, they were pressuring the appraisers
1015.194	through the compensation system,
1016.976	trying to produce what we call a Gresham's dynamic,
1019.638	in which bad ethics drives good ethics
1022.217	out of the marketplace.
1023.583	And they largely succeeded,
1025.519	which is how the fraud became endemic.
1028.402	And the third thing that we need to do
1031.1	is deal with what we call the three D's:
1033.738	deregulation, desupervision,
1036.319	and the de facto decriminalization.
1040.34	Because we can make
1042.437	all three of these changes, and if we do so,
1046.111	we can dramatically reduce
1048.92	how often we have a crisis
1051.112	and how severe those crises are.
1054.739	That is not simply critical to our economy.
1057.72	You can see what these crises do to inequality
1061.146	and what they do to our democracy.
1063.466	They have produced crony capitalism,
1066.21	American-style,
1067.592	in which the largest financial institutions
1070.87	are the leading financial donors of both parties,
1074.514	and that's the reason why
1076.434	even after this crisis,
1085.694	we have no meaningful reforms
1088.548	in any of the three areas that I've talked about,
1091.922	other than banning liar's loans,
1093.714	which is good,
1094.79	but that's just one form of ammunition
1097.214	for this fraud weapon.
1098.61	There are many forms of ammunition they can use.
1102.591	That's why we need to learn
1104.342	what the bankers have learned:
1106.454	the recipe for the best way to rob a bank,
1109.877	so that we can stop that recipe,
1112.742	because our legislators,
1114.504	who are dependent on political contributions,
1117.194	will not do it on their own.
1119.388	Thank you very much.
1121.458	(Applause)
