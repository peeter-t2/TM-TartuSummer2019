12.8	I come from one of the most liberal,
16.32	tolerant, progressive places
16.32	in the United States,
19.56	Seattle, Washington.
21.48	And I grew up with a family
21.48	of great Seattlites.
25.4	My mother was an artist,
25.4	my father was a college professor,
29.24	and I am truly grateful for my upbringing,
31.8	because I always felt completely
31.8	comfortable designing my life
36.32	exactly as I saw fit.
39	And in point of fact,
40.36	I took a route that was not exactly
40.36	what my parents had in mind.
43.48	When I was 19, I dropped out of college --
47.12	dropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs.
49.2	(Laughter)
52.68	And I went on the road
52.68	as a professional French horn player,
56.96	which was my lifelong dream.
58.68	I played chamber music
58.68	all over the United States and Europe,
61.6	and I toured for a couple of years
63.4	with a great jazz guitar player
63.4	named Charlie Bird.
66.4	And by the end of my 20s,
68	I wound up as a member of the Barcelona
68	Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
72.2	What a great life.
73.44	And you know, my parents never complained.
77.04	They supported me all the way through it.
79.04	It wasn't their dream.
80.96	They used to tell
80.96	their neighbors and friends,
83.127	"""Our son, he's taking a gap decade."""
86.2	(Laughter)
88.88	And --
90.8	There was, however, one awkward
90.8	conversation about my lifestyle
95.72	that I want to tell you about.
97.2	I was 27, and I was home from Barcelona,
100	and I was visiting
100	my parents for Christmas,
102.72	and I was cooking dinner with my mother,
102.72	and we were alone in the kitchen.
107.24	And she was quiet, too quiet.
110.08	Something was wrong.
111.56	"And so I said, ""Mom, what's on your mind?"""
114.76	"And she said, ""Your dad and I"
114.76	"are really worried about you."""
119.04	"And I said, ""What?"""
119.04	I mean, what could it be, at this point?
121.96	"And she said, ""I want you to be"
121.96	completely honest with me:
125.68	"have you been voting for Republicans?"""
127.64	(Laughter)
132.68	Now, the truth is,
134.08	I wasn't really political,
134.08	I was just a French horn player.
138.48	But I had a bit of an epiphany,
142.039	and they had detected it,
142.039	and it was causing some confusion.
144.92	You see, I had become
144.92	an enthusiast for capitalism,
150.2	and I want to tell you why that is.
152.84	It stems from a lifelong interest of mine
157	in, believe it or not, poverty.
159.92	See, when I was a kid
159.92	growing up in Seattle,
162.28	I remember the first time
162.28	I saw real poverty.
165.92	We were a lower middle class family,
165.92	but that's of course not real poverty.
170.32	That's not even close.
172.08	The first time I saw poverty,
172.08	and poverty's face,
175.52	was when I was six
175.52	or seven years old, early 1970s.
178.36	And it was like a lot of you,
178.36	kind of a prosaic example, kind of trite.
182.92	It was a picture in the National
182.92	Geographic Magazine
186.32	of a kid who was my age in East Africa,
190.64	and there were flies on his face
190.64	and a distended belly.
193.24	And he wasn't going to make it,
193.24	and I knew that, and I was helpless.
198.72	Some of you remember that picture,
200.72	not exactly that picture,
200.72	one just like it.
202.76	It introduced the West
202.76	to grinding poverty around the world.
208.24	Well, that vision kind of haunted me
208.24	as I grew up and I went to school
213.04	and I dropped out and dropped in
214.84	and started my family.
217.496	And I wondered, what happened to that kid?
219.52	Or to people just like him
219.52	all over the world?
223.2	And so I started to study,
223.2	even though I wasn't in college,
226	I was looking for the answer:
227.44	what happened to the world's
227.44	poorest people?
229.56	Has it gotten worse?
229.56	Has it gotten better? What?
231.84	And I found the answer,
231.84	and it changed my life,
234.64	and I want to share it with you.
237.04	See --
239.76	most Americans believe
239.76	that poverty has gotten worse
244.04	since we were children,
244.04	since they saw that vision.
247.2	"If you ask Americans, ""Has poverty"
247.2	"gotten worse or better around the world?"","
	has gotten worse since the early 1970s.
254.24	But here's the truth.
255.76	Here's the epiphany that I had
255.76	that changed my thinking.
259.48	From 1970 until today,
262.88	the percentage of the world's population
265.76	living in starvation levels,
267.8	living on a dollar a day or less,
267.8	obviously adjusted for inflation,
271.48	that percentage has declined
274.72	by 80 percent.
277.08	There's been an 80 percent decline
277.08	in the world's worst poverty
280.08	since I was a kid.
281.32	And I didn't even know about it.
282.92	This, my friends, that's a miracle.
285.32	That's something we ought to celebrate.
287.64	It's the greatest antipoverty achievement
287.64	in the history of mankind,
291.92	and it happened in our lifetimes.
294.48	(Applause)
298.04	So when I learned this, I asked,
298.04	what did that? What made it possible?
302.92	Because if you don't know why,
302.92	you can't do it again.
305.76	If you want to replicate it
307.12	and get the next two billion
307.12	people out of poverty,
309.68	because that's what we're talking about:
309.68	since I was a kid,
312.48	two billion of the least of these,
312.48	our brothers and sisters,
315.316	have been pulled out of poverty.
316.88	I want the next two billion,
316.88	so I've got to know why.
319.386	And I went in search of an answer.
321.04	And it wasn't a political answer,
321.04	because I didn't care.
323.72	You know what, I still don't care.
325.4	I wanted the best answer
325.4	from mainstream economists
330.24	left, right and center.
332.88	And here it is.
334.56	Here are the reasons.
335.84	There are five reasons that two billion
335.84	of our brothers and sisters
339.6	have been pulled out of poverty
339.6	since I was a kid.
342	Number one: globalization.
345.08	Number two: free trade.
347.2	Number three: property rights.
349.56	Number four: rule of law.
352.12	Number five: entrepreneurship.
355.12	It was the free enterprise system
355.12	spreading around the world
359.4	after 1970 that did that.
361.2	Now, I'm not naive.
363.64	I know that free enterprise isn't perfect,
366.12	and I know that free enterprise
366.12	isn't everything we need
369.28	to build a better world.
370.52	But that is great.
373.08	And that's beyond politics.
374.44	Here's what I learned.
374.44	This is the epiphany.
376.56	Capitalism is not just about accumulation.
379.6	At its best, it's about aspiration,
382.16	which is what so many people
382.16	on this stage talk about,
384.88	is the aspiration that comes from dreams
388.12	that are embedded
388.12	in the free enterprise system.
390.4	And we've got to share it
390.4	with more people.
392.6	Now, I want to tell you
392.6	about a second epiphany
395.84	that's related to that first one
398.36	that I think can bring us progress,
398.36	not just around the world,
401.44	but right here at home.
403.84	The best quote I've ever heard
405.88	to summarize the thoughts
405.88	that I've just given you
409.48	about pulling people out of poverty
411.56	is as follows:
413.68	"""Free markets have created more wealth"
413.68	than any system in history.
418.56	"They have lifted billions out of poverty."""
422.4	Who said it?
423.68	It sounds like Milton Friedman
423.68	or Ronald Reagan.
427.8	Wrong.
429.48	President Barack Obama said that.
432.44	Why do I know it by heart?
434.96	Because he said it to me.
437.64	Crazy.
439.16	"And I said, ""Hallelujah."""
442.8	But more than that, I said,
445.32	"""What an opportunity."""
447.04	You know what I was thinking?
448.56	It was at an event
448.56	that we were doing on the subject
451.04	at Georgetown University in May of 2015.
453	And I thought, this is the solution
455.8	to the biggest problem
455.8	facing America today. What?
459.32	It's coming together around these ideas,
462.12	liberals and conservatives,
463.88	to help people who need us the most.
467.48	Now, I don't have to tell anybody
467.48	in this room that we're in a crisis,
470.8	in America and many countries around
470.8	the world with political polarization.
474.4	It's risen to critical, crisis levels.
476.32	It's unpleasant. It's not right.
479.32	There was an article last year
481	in the Proceedings
481	of the National Academy of Sciences,
483.64	which is one of the most
483.64	prestigious scientific journals
488.08	published in the West.
489.36	And it was an article in 2014
491.84	on political motive asymmetry.
494.28	What's that? That's what psychologists
494.28	call the phenomenon
497.019	of assuming that your ideology
497.019	is based in love
501.44	but your opponents' ideology
501.44	is based in hate.
504.92	It's common in world conflict.
507.76	You expect to see this between
507.76	Palestinians and Israelis, for example.
512.4	What the authors of this article found
514.84	was that in America today,
514.84	a majority of Republicans and Democrats
519.48	suffer from political motive asymmetry.
522.08	A majority of people in our country today
522.08	who are politically active believe
525.96	that they are motivated by love
525.96	but the other side is motivated by hate.
529.4	Think about it. Think about it.
530.96	Most people are walking around saying,
533.159	"""You know, my ideology"
533.159	is based on basic benevolence,
536.36	I want to help people,
537.6	but the other guys,
537.6	"they're evil and out to get me."""
541.2	You can't progress as a society
541.2	when you have this kind of asymmetry.
546.52	It's impossible.
548.56	How do we solve it?
549.84	Well, first, let's be honest:
549.84	there are differences.
553.52	Let's not minimize the differences.
553.52	That would be really na√Øve.
557.24	There's a lot of good research on this.
559.32	A veteran of the TED stage
559.32	is my friend Jonathan Haidt.
562.48	He's a psychology professor
562.48	at New York University.
565.56	He does work on the ideology
565.56	and values and morals of different people
570.52	to see how they differ.
572.36	And he's shown, for example,
572.36	that conservatives and liberals
575.194	have a very different emphasis
575.194	on what they think is important.
578.234	For example, Jon Haidt has shown
581.56	that liberals care about poverty
	about economic liberty.
588.28	And conservatives
588.28	care about economic liberty
	than they care about poverty.
594.92	Irreconcilable differences, right?
597	We'll never come together. Wrong.
599.52	That is diversity
599.52	in which lies our strength.
602.92	Remember what pulled up the poor.
607.08	It was the obsession with poverty,
610.16	accompanied by the method
610.16	of economic freedom
614.4	spreading around the world.
616.04	We need each other, in other words,
618.6	if we want to help people and get the next
618.6	two billion people out of poverty.
622.244	There's no other way.
624.56	Hmm.
625.92	How are we going to get that?
628.36	It's a tricky thing, isn't it.
630.04	We need innovative thinking.
632.28	A lot of it's on this stage.
633.96	Social entrepreneurship.
633.96	Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal.
638.28	We need investment overseas
640.64	in a sustainable, responsible,
640.64	ethical and moral way. Yes. Yes.
645.04	But you know what we really need?
646.88	We need a new day in flexible ideology.
651.52	We need to be less predictable.
654.68	Don't we?
655.92	Do you ever feel like your own ideology
655.92	is starting to get predictable?
660.52	Kinda conventional?
662.28	Do you ever feel like you're always
662.28	listening to people who agree with you?
666.44	Why is that dangerous?
668.2	Because when we talk
668.2	in this country about economics,
671.8	on the right, conservatives,
673.48	you're always talking about taxes
673.48	and regulations and big government.
678.88	And on the left, liberals,
678.88	you're talking about economics,
681.64	it's always about income inequality.
683.92	Right? Now those are important things,
687.36	really important to me,
687.36	really important to you.
689.64	But when it comes to lifting people up
692.2	who are starving and need us today,
692.2	those are distractions.
696.68	We need to come together
696.68	around the best ways
700.12	to mitigate poverty
700.12	using the best tools at our disposal,
703.48	and that comes only when conservatives
703.48	recognize that they need liberals
708	and their obsession with poverty,
709.64	and liberals need conservatives
709.64	and their obsession with free markets.
715.24	That's the diversity in which lies
715.24	the future strength of this country,
719.76	if we choose to take it.
722.76	So how are we going to do it?
722.76	How are we going to do it together?
725.84	I've got to have some action items,
725.84	not just for you but for me.
729.4	Number one. Action item number one:
732.32	remember, it's not good enough
732.32	just to tolerate people who disagree.
737.56	It's not good enough.
739.28	We have to remember that we need
739.28	people who disagree with us,
743.2	because there are people
743.2	who need all of us
745.56	who are still waiting for these tools.
748.68	Now, what are you going to do?
748.68	How are you going to express that?
752	Where does this start? It starts here.
753.96	You know, all of us
753.96	in this room, we're blessed.
757.24	We're blessed with people
757.24	who listen to us.
759.32	We're blessed with prosperity.
759.32	We're blessed with leadership.
762.24	When people hear us,
762.24	with the kind of unpredictable ideology,
767.2	then maybe people will listen.
769.64	Maybe progress will start at that point.
771.84	That's number one. Number two.
774.16	Number two: I'm asking you
774.16	and I'm asking me
778.68	to be the person specifically
778.68	who blurs the lines,
783.08	who is ambiguous, who is hard to classify.
787.16	If you're a conservative,
788.44	be the conservative
788.44	who is always going on about poverty
792	and the moral obligation
792	to be a warrior for the poor.
794.84	And if you're a liberal,
794.84	be a liberal who is always talking
798.56	about the beauty of free markets
798.56	to solve our problems
803.16	when we use them responsibly.
805.32	If we do that, we get two things.
808.08	Number one: we get to start
808.08	to work on the next two billion
812.68	and be the solution
812.68	that we've seen so much of in the past
816.24	and we need to see more of in the future.
816.24	That's what we get.
819.16	And the second is
819.16	that we might just be able
822.16	to take the ghastly holy war of ideology
822.16	that we're suffering under in this country
826.84	and turn it into a competition of ideas
831.12	based on solidarity and mutual respect.
834.12	And then maybe, just maybe,
838	we'll all realize that our big differences
842.36	aren't really that big after all.
845.4	Thank you.
846.64	(Applause)
