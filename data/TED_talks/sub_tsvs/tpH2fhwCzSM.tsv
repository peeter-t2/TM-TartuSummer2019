12.839	So how many of you have ever
12.839	been in a cave before?
15.576	Okay, a few of you.
16.987	When you think of a cave, most of you think
18.619	of a tunnel going through solid rock,
20.78	and in fact, that's how most caves are.
22.711	Around this half of the country,
24.094	most of your caves are made of limestone.
26.1	Back where I'm from, most of our 
26.1	caves are made of lava rock,
29.048	because we have a lot of volcanoes out there.
30.881	But the caves I want to share 
30.881	with you today are made
32.931	completely of ice, specifically glacier ice
36.044	that's formed in the side of the tallest mountain
38.042	in the state of Oregon, called Mount Hood.
41.125	Now Mount Hood's only 
41.125	one hour's drive from Portland,
44.188	the largest city in Oregon,
45.911	where over two million people live.
48.14	Now the most exciting thing for a cave explorer
50.387	is to find a new cave
51.944	and be the first human to ever go into it.
54.157	The second most exciting thing for a cave explorer
56.124	is to be the first one to make a map of a cave.
58.555	Now these days, with so many people hiking around,
60.763	it's pretty hard to find a new cave,
62.688	so you can imagine how excited we were
64.218	to find three new caves
65.989	within sight of Oregon's largest city
68.025	and realize that they had never been explored
70.071	or mapped before.
71.402	It was kind of like being an astronaut,
72.598	because we were getting to
72.598	see things and go places
75.285	that no one had ever seen or gone to before.
78.569	So what is a glacier?
80.303	Well, those of you who have
80.303	ever seen or touched snow,
82.216	you know that it's really light,
83.499	because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals
83.499	clumped together, and it's mostly air.
87.22	If you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball,
89.63	it gets really small, hard and dense.
91.828	Well, on a mountain like Hood, where it snows
93.58	over 20 feet a year,
95.361	it crushes the air out of it
97.304	and gradually forms it into hard blue ice.
100.485	Now each year, more and more ice
100.485	stacks up on top of it,
103.445	and eventually it gets so heavy
105.357	that it starts to slide down the mountain
107.143	under its own weight,
108.581	forming a slow-moving river of ice.
110.879	When ice packed like that starts to move,
113.224	we call it a glacier, and we give it a name.
115.334	The name of the glacier these caves are formed in
117.154	is the Sandy Glacier.
118.83	Now each year, as new snow lands on the glacier,
122.283	it melts in the summer sun,
123.95	and it forms little rivers of water
123.95	on the flow along the ice,
126.809	and they start to melt and bore
126.809	their way down through the glacier,
129.686	forming big networks of caves,
131.614	sometimes going all the way down
131.614	to the underlying bedrock.
134.919	Now the crazy thing about glacier caves
136.991	is that each year, new tunnels form.
140.098	Different waterfalls pop up or move around
142.091	from place to place inside the cave.
144.223	Warm water from the top of the ice
146.068	is boring its way down,
147.545	and warm air from below the mountain
149.485	actually rises up, gets into the cave,
151.926	and melts the ceilings back taller and taller.
154.469	But the weirdest thing about glacier caves
156.596	is that the entire cave is moving,
158.702	because it's formed inside a block of ice
160.582	the size of a small city
162.273	that's slowly sliding down the mountain.
164.67	Now this is Brent McGregor,
166.497	my cave exploration partner.
168.469	He and I have both been exploring caves a long time
171.084	and we've been climbing mountains a long time,
173.052	but neither one of us had ever really
173.052	explored a glacier cave before.
176.132	Back in 2011, Brent saw a YouTube video
179.177	of a couple of hikers that stumbled across
179.177	the entrance to one of these caves.
182.804	There were no GPS coordinates for it,
184.824	and all we knew was that it was somewhere
186.367	out on the Sandy Glacier.
188.047	So in July of that year, we went out on the glacier,
190.646	and we found a big crack in the ice.
192.624	We had to build snow and ice anchors
194.825	so that we could tie off ropes
194.825	and rappel down into the hole.
198.017	This is me looking into the entrance crevasse.
200.753	At the end of this hole, we found a huge tunnel
203.304	going right up the mountain
204.795	underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice.
207.328	We followed this cave back for about a half mile
209.732	until it came to an end,
211.371	and then with the help of our survey tools
213.497	we made a three-dimensional map of the cave
215.565	on our way back out.
217.088	So how do you map a cave?
219.146	Well, cave maps aren't like trail maps or road maps
221.874	because they have pits and holes 
221.874	going to overlapping levels.
225.098	To make a cave map, you have to set up
226.702	survey stations every few feet inside the cave,
229.597	and you use a laser to measure
229.597	the distance between those stations.
232.888	Then you use a compass and an inclinometer
235.327	to measure the direction the cave is headed
237.263	and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings.
239.979	Now those of you taking trigonometry,
241.709	that particular type of math is very useful
243.82	for making maps like this
245.353	because it allows you to measure
245.353	heights and distances
247.598	without actually having to go there.
249.503	In fact, the more I mapped and studied caves,
251.882	the more useful I found all that math
253.913	that I originally hated in school to be.
256.155	So when you're done surveying,
258.028	you take all this data and
258.028	you punch it into a computer
260.455	and you find someone that can draw really well,
263.075	and you have them draft up a map
264.723	that looks something like this,
266.276	and it'll show you both a
266.276	bird's-eye view of the passage
269.544	as well as a profile view of the passage,
271.994	kind of like an ant farm view.
273.714	We named this cave Snow Dragon Cave
275.713	because it was like a big dragon
275.713	sleeping under the snow.
278.761	Now later this summer, as more
278.761	snow melted off the glacier,
281.273	we found more caves, and we realized
281.273	they were all connected.
284.94	Not long after we mapped Snow Dragon,
287.099	Brent discovered this new cave not very far away.
290.119	The inside of it was coated with ice,
292.258	so we had to wear big spikes
292.258	on our feet called crampons
295.185	so we could walk around without slipping.
297.489	This cave was amazing.
299.35	The ice in the ceiling was glowing blue anad green
301.606	because the sunlight from far above
303.344	was shining through the ice and lighting it all up.
306.319	And we couldn't understand why this cave
308.227	was so much colder than Snow Dragon
309.873	until we got to the end and we found out why.
312.782	There was a huge pit or shaft called a moulin
315.7	going 130 feet straight up
315.7	to the surface of the glacier.
319.335	Cold air from the top of the mountain
321.146	was flowing down this hole
321.146	and blasting through the cave,
323.96	freezing everything inside of it.
326.043	And we were so excited about finding this new pit,
328.254	we actually came back in January the following year
330.562	so we could be the first ones to explore it.
333.357	It was so cold outside,
334.782	we actually had to sleep inside the cave.
337.04	There's our camp on the left side 
337.04	of this entrance room.
340.768	The next morning, we climbed out of the cave
343.377	and hiked all the way to the top of the glacier,
345.386	where we finally rigged and rappelled this pit
347.614	for the very first time.
349.381	Brent named this cave Pure Imagination,
351.468	I think because the beautiful sights we saw in there
353.485	were beyond what we could have ever imagined.
356.067	So besides really cool ice,
356.067	what else is inside these caves?
359.23	Well not too much lives in them 
359.23	because they're so cold
361.816	and the entrance is actually covered up with snow
363.826	for about eight months of the year.
365.535	But there are some really cool things in there.
367.471	There's weird bacteria living in the water
369.834	that actually eat and digest rocks
372.098	to make their own food
373.452	to live under this ice.
375.168	In fact, this past summer, scientists collected
377.27	samples of water and ice
379.1	specifically to see if things called extremophiles,
382.035	tiny lifeforms that are evolved
382.035	to live in completely hostile conditions,
385.874	might be living under the ice,
387.311	kind of like what they hope to find
387.311	on the polar icecaps of Mars someday.
390.989	Another really cool things is that,
392.45	as seeds and birds land on
392.45	the surface of the glacier and die,
395.706	they get buried in the snow
397.35	and gradually become part of the glacier,
399.14	sinking deeper and deeper into the ice.
401.514	As these caves form and melt 
401.514	their way up into the ice,
404.757	they make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling
407.206	and fall onto the cave floor,
407.206	where we end up finding them.
409.935	For example, this is a noble fir seed we found.
412.961	It's been frozen in the ice for over 100 years,
415.186	and it's just now starting to sprout.
417.895	This mallard duck feather
419.59	was found over 1,800 feet
419.59	in the back of Snow Dragon Cave.
422.911	This duck died on the surface
422.911	of the glacier long, long ago,
425.869	and its feathers have finally made it
425.869	down through over 100 feet of ice
429.324	before falling inside the cave.
431.508	And this beautiful quartz crystal
433.04	was also found in the back of Snow Dragon.
435.165	Even now, Brent and I find it hard to believe
437.437	that all these discoveries were 
437.437	essentially in our own backyard,
440.781	hidden away, just waiting to be found.
443.481	Like I said earlier, the idea of discovering
445.754	in this busy world we live in
447.161	kind of seems like something 
447.161	you can only do with space travel now,
450.061	but that's not true.
451.559	Every year, new caves get discovered
453.837	that no one has ever been in before.
455.602	So it's actually not too late for one of you
457.849	to become a discoverer yourself.
459.71	You just have to be willing to look
461.571	and go where people don't often go
464.207	and focus your eyes and your mind
466.185	to recognize the discovery when you see it,
468.402	because it might be in your own backyard.
470.733	Thank you very much.
472.587	(Applause)
