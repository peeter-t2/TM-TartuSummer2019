25	My search is always to find ways to chronicle,
30	to share and to document stories about people, just everyday people.
35	Stories that offer transformation, that lean into transcendence,
40	but that are never sentimental,
42	that never look away from the darkest things about us.
46	Because I really believe that we're never more beautiful
49	than when we're most ugly.
51	Because that's really the moment we really know what we're made of.
55	As Chris said, I grew up in Nigeria
60	with a whole generation -- in the '80s --
62	of students who were protesting a military dictatorship, which has finally ended.
68	So it wasn't just me, there was a whole generation of us.
70	But what I've come to learn
73	is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures,
77	but in the simple accumulation of gentle, soft, almost invisible acts of compassion,
84	everyday acts of compassion.
86	In South Africa, they have a phrase called Ubuntu.
93	Ubuntu comes out of a philosophy that says,
95	the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect
99	my humanity back at me.
101	But if you're like me, my humanity is more like a window.
105	I don't really see it, I don't pay attention to it
107	until there's, you know, like a bug that's dead on the window.
110	Then suddenly I see it, and usually, it's never good.
114	It's usually when I'm cussing in traffic
117	at someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffee
120	and send emails and make notes.
124	So what Ubuntu really says
127	is that there is no way for us to be human without other people.
132	It's really very simple, but really very complicated.
135	So, I thought I should start with some stories.
138	I should tell you some stories about remarkable people,
140	so I thought I'd start with my mother.
143	(Laughter)
144	And she was dark, too.
146	My mother was English.
147	My parents met in Oxford in the '50s,
149	and my mother moved to Nigeria and lived there.
151	She was five foot two, very feisty and very English.
155	This is how English my mother is -- or was, she just passed.
158	She came out to California, to Los Angeles, to visit me,
162	and we went to Malibu, which she thought was very disappointing.
164	(Laughter)
166	And then we went to a fish restaurant,
168	and we had Chad, the surfer dude, serving us,
171	and he came up and my mother said,
173	"""Do you have any specials, young man?"""
175	"And Chad says, ""Sure, like, we have this, like, salmon,"
179	that's, like, rolled in this, like, wasabi, like, crust.
181	"It's totally rad."""
183	And my mother turned to me and said,
186	"""What language is he speaking?"""
188	(Laughter)
189	"I said, ""English, mum."""
191	And she shook her head and said,
193	"""Oh, these Americans. We gave them a language,"
195	"why don't they use it?"""
197	(Laughter)
203	So, this woman, who converted from the Church of England
207	to Catholicism when she married my father --
209	and there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert --
213	decided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria,
217	particularly among Igbo women,
219	the Billings ovulation method,
221	which was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church.
225	But her Igbo wasn't too good.
229	So she took me along to translate.
231	I was seven.
233	(Laughter)
234	So, here are these women,
236	who never discuss their period with their husbands,
239	"and here I am telling them, ""Well, how often do you get your period?"""
243	(Laughter)
244	"And, ""Do you notice any discharges?"""
246	(Laughter)
247	"And, ""How swollen is your vulva?"""
249	(Laughter)
254	She never would have thought of herself as a feminist,
257	my mother, but she always used to say,
260	"""Anything a man can do, I can fix."""
263	(Applause)
270	And when my father complained about this situation,
275	where she's taking a seven-year-old boy
277	to teach this birth control, you know,
279	"he used to say, ""Oh, you're turning him into --"
281	"you're teaching him how to be a woman."""
283	"My mother said, ""Someone has to."""
285	(Laughter)
286	This woman -- during the Biafran war,
290	we were caught in the war.
292	It was my mother with five little children.
295	It takes her one year, through refugee camp after refugee camp,
298	to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country.
300	At every single refugee camp, she has to face off soldiers
306	who want to take my elder brother Mark, who was nine,
308	and make him a boy soldier.
310	Can you imagine this five-foot-two woman,
312	standing up to men with guns who want to kill us?
316	All through that one year,
318	my mother never cried one time, not once.
321	But when we were in Lisbon, in the airport,
323	about to fly to England,
325	this woman saw my mother wearing this dress,
328	which had been washed so many times it was basically see through,
332	with five really hungry-looking kids,
335	came over and asked her what had happened.
337	And she told this woman.
338	And so this woman emptied out her suitcase
340	and gave all of her clothes to my mother, and to us,
343	and the toys of her kids, who didn't like that very much, but --
346	(Laughter) --
347	that was the only time she cried.
350	And I remember years later, I was writing about my mother,
352	"and I asked her, ""Why did you cry then?"""
354	"And she said, ""You know, you can steel your heart"
357	against any kind of trouble, any kind of horror.
360	But the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger
365	"will unstitch you."""
371	The old women in my father's village, after this war had happened,
375	memorized the names of every dead person,
378	and they would sing these dirges, made up of these names.
385	Dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you.
387	And they would sing them only when they planted the rice,
391	as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead
393	into the rice.
395	But when it came for harvest time,
397	they would sing these joyful songs,
399	that were made up of the names of every child
401	who had been born that year.
404	And then the next planting season, when they sang the dirge,
408	they would remove as many names of the dead
411	that equaled as many people that were born.
413	And in this way, these women enacted a lot of transformation,
419	beautiful transformation.
421	Did you know, that before the genocide in Rwanda,
425	the word for rape and the word for marriage
428	was the same one?
431	But today, women are rebuilding Rwanda.
435	Did you also know that after apartheid,
438	when the new government went into the parliament houses,
440	there were no female toilets in the building?
444	Which would seem to suggest that apartheid
446	was entirely the business of men.
449	All of this to say, that despite the horror, and despite the death,
453	women are never really counted.
456	Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us.
461	When I was growing up in Nigeria --
464	and I shouldn't say Nigeria, because that's too general,
466	but in Afikpo, the Igbo part of the country where I'm from --
469	there were always rites of passage for young men.
472	Men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women,
476	that's essentially what it is.
478	And a lot of rituals involved killing, killing little animals,
482	progressing along, so when I turned 13 --
484	and, I mean, it made sense, it was an agrarian community,
487	somebody had to kill the animals,
489	there was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at --
492	so when I turned 13, it was my turn now to kill a goat.
497	And I was this weird, sensitive kid, who couldn't really do it,
501	but I had to do it.
503	And I was supposed to do this alone.
505	But a friend of mine, called Emmanuel,
507	who was significantly older than me,
509	who'd been a boy soldier during the Biafran war,
511	decided to come with me.
514	Which sort of made me feel good,
517	because he'd seen a lot of things.
519	Now, when I was growing up, he used to tell me
521	stories about how he used to bayonet people,
523	and their intestines would fall out, but they would keep running.
526	So, this guy comes with me.
529	And I don't know if you've ever heard a goat, or seen one --
532	they sound like human beings,
534	"that's why we call tragedies ""a song of a goat."""
537	My friend Brad Kessler says that we didn't become human
542	until we started keeping goats.
544	Anyway, a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes.
549	So when I tried to kill this goat and I couldn't,
551	Emmanuel bent down, he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat,
556	covers its eyes, so I don't have to look into them,
559	while I kill the goat.
562	It didn't seem like a lot, for this guy who'd seen so much,
566	and to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed
568	such a quotidian experience,
570	still found it in himself to try to protect me.
576	I was a wimp.
578	I cried for a very long time.
580	And afterwards, he didn't say a word.
582	He just sat there watching me cry for an hour.
584	And then afterwards he said to me,
586	"""It will always be difficult, but if you cry like this every time,"
591	you will die of heartbreak.
593	Just know that it is enough sometimes
596	"to know that it is difficult."""
601	Of course, talking about goats makes me think of sheep,
604	and not in good ways.
606	(Laughter)
608	So, I was born two days after Christmas.
612	So growing up, you know, I had a cake and everything,
615	but I never got any presents, because, born two days after Christmas.
620	So, I was about nine, and my uncle had just come back from Germany,
623	and we had the Catholic priest over,
626	my mother was entertaining him with tea.
628	"And my uncle suddenly says, ""Where are Chris' presents?"""
632	"And my mother said, ""Don't talk about that in front of guests."""
636	But he was desperate to show that he'd just come back,
639	so he summoned me up, and he said,
641	"""Go into the bedroom, my bedroom."
643	Take anything you want out of the suitcase.
645	"It's your birthday present."""
647	I'm sure he thought I'd take a book or a shirt,
649	but I found an inflatable sheep.
652	(Laughter)
658	So, I blew it up and ran into the living room,
660	my finger where it shouldn't have been,
662	I was waving this buzzing sheep around,
665	and my mother looked like she was going to die of shock.
668	(Laughter)
671	And Father McGetrick was completely unflustered,
674	just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said,
676	"""It's all right Daphne, I'm Scottish."""
679	(Laughter)
681	(Applause)
695	My last days in prison, the last 18 months,
701	my cellmate -- for the last year, the first year of the last 18 months --
705	my cellmate was 14 years old.
708	The name was John James,
711	and in those days, if a family member committed a crime,
715	the military would hold you as ransom
718	till your family turned themselves in.
720	So, here was this 14-year-old kid on death row.
723	And not everybody on death row was a political prisoner.
725	There were some really bad people there.
728	And he had smuggled in two comics, two comic books --
731	"""Spiderman"" and ""X-Men."""
733	He was obsessed.
734	And when he got tired of reading them,
736	he started to teach the men in death row how to read,
740	with these comic books.
742	And so, I remember night after night,
746	you'd hear all these men, these really hardened criminals,
748	"huddled around John James, reciting, ""Take that, Spidey!"""
753	(Laughter)
755	It's incredible.
758	I was really worried.
760	He didn't know what death row meant.
762	I'd been there twice,
764	and I was terribly afraid that I was going to die.
766	And he would always laugh, and say,
768	"""Come on, man, we'll make it out."""
770	"Then I'd say, ""How do you know?"""
772	"And he said, ""Oh, I heard it on the grapevine."""
776	They killed him.
778	They handcuffed him to a chair,
781	and they tacked his penis to a table with a six-inch nail,
787	then left him there to bleed to death.
790	That's how I ended up in solitary, because I let my feelings be known.
799	All around us, everywhere, there are people like this.
804	The Igbo used to say that they built their own gods.
810	They would come together as a community,
812	and they would express a wish.
815	And their wish would then be brought to a priest,
817	who would find a ritual object,
820	and the appropriate sacrifices would be made,
822	and the shrine would be built for the god.
825	But if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice,
830	the Igbos would destroy the god.
832	They would knock down the shrine,
835	and they would stop saying the god's name.
837	This is how they came to reclaim their humanity.
842	Every day, all of us here,
844	we're building gods that have gone rampant,
847	and it's time we started knocking them down
850	and forgetting their names.
853	It doesn't require a tremendous thing.
856	All it requires is to recognize among us, every day --
860	the few of us that can see -- are surrounded by people
863	like the ones I've told you.
866	There are some of you in this room, amazing people,
869	who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity.
875	I want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton.
880	"The poem is called ""Libation,"" and it's for my friend Vusi"
885	who is in the audience here somewhere.
889	"""Libation,"
891	North Carolina, 1999.
894	I offer to this ground, this gin.
901	I imagine an old man crying here,
904	out of the sight of the overseer.
908	He pushes his tongue through a hole
911	where his tooth would be, if he were whole.
916	It aches in that space where his tooth would be,
920	where his land would be,
923	his house, his wife, his son, his beautiful daughter.
929	He wipes sorrow from his face,
934	and puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue,
938	and tastes the salt.
944	I call a name that could be his.
946	This is for you, old man.
951	"This gin, this salty earth."""
955	Thank you.
957	(Applause)
