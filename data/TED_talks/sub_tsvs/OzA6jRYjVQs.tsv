12.58	Since 2009, the world has been stuck
16.5	on a single narrative
16.5	around a coming global food crisis
21.66	and what we need to do to avoid it.
24.86	How do we feed
24.86	nine billion people by 2050?
30.26	Every conference, podcast
30.26	and dialogue around global food security
34.9	starts with this question
36.62	and goes on to answer it
38.38	by saying we need to produce
44.98	The 2050 narrative started to evolve
47.82	shortly after global food prices
47.82	hit all-time highs in 2008.
53.26	People were suffering and struggling,
56.06	governments and world leaders
57.62	needed to show us
57.62	that they were paying attention
60.26	and were working to solve it.
63.58	The thing is, 2050
63.58	is so far into the future
67.38	that we can't even relate to it,
70.1	and more importantly,
71.86	if we keep doing what we're doing,
74.14	it's going to hit us
74.14	a lot sooner than that.
77.9	I believe we need to ask
77.9	a different question.
82.1	The answer to that question
84.46	needs to be framed differently.
88.94	If we can reframe the old narrative
91.7	and replace it with new numbers
94.18	that tell us a more complete pictures,
97.54	numbers that everyone can understand
100.74	and relate to,
103.14	we can avoid the crisis altogether.
108.38	I was a commodities trader in my past life
111.26	and one of the things
111.26	that I learned trading
113.46	is that every market has a tipping point,
117.18	the point at which
117.18	change occurs so rapidly
120.78	that it impacts the world
122.66	and things change forever.
125.9	Think of the last financial crisis,
129.62	or the dot-com crash.
132.74	So here's my concern.
136.58	We could have a tipping point
138.66	in global food and agriculture
140.82	if surging demand
142.739	surpasses the agricultural system's
142.739	structural capacity to produce food.
150.06	This means at this point supply
150.06	can no longer keep up with demand
154.82	despite exploding prices,
157.1	unless we can commit
157.1	to some type of structural change.
162.38	This time around,
164.18	it won't be about stock markets and money.
166.78	It's about people.
168.18	People could starve
168.18	and governments may fall.
173.02	This question of at what point
173.02	does supply struggle
177.58	to keep up with surging demand
179.26	is one that started off as an interest
179.26	for me while I was trading
182.94	and became an absolute obsession.
185.74	It went from interest to obsession
188.7	when I realized through my research
188.7	how broken the system was
192.38	and how very little data was being used
192.38	to make such critical decisions.
197.46	That's the point I decided to walk away
197.46	from a career on Wall Street
201.74	and start an entrepreneurial journey
204.26	to start Gro Intelligence.
206.7	At Gro, we focus on bringing this data
210.22	and doing the work to make it actionable,
212.5	to empower decision-makers at every level.
216.7	But doing this work,
218.34	we also realized that the world,
220.62	not just world leaders,
222.3	but businesses and citizens
222.3	like every single person in this room,
226.58	lacked an actionable guide
229.58	on how we can avoid
229.58	a coming global food security crisis.
234.22	And so we built a model,
236.26	leveraging the petabytes
236.26	of data we sit on,
239.18	and we solved for the tipping point.
242.38	Now, no one knows
242.38	we've been working on this problem
246.02	and this is the first time
246.02	that I'm sharing what we discovered.
252.02	We discovered that the tipping point
252.02	is actually a decade from now.
258.1	We discovered that the world
260.46	will be short 214 trillion calories
266.78	by 2027.
269.26	The world is not in a position
269.26	to fill this gap.
274.22	Now, you'll notice
276.78	that the way I'm framing this
276.78	is different from how I started,
281.1	and that's intentional, because until now
283.26	this problem has been
283.26	quantified using mass:
286.5	think kilograms, tons, hectograms,
289.34	whatever your unit of choice is in mass.
292.1	Why do we talk about food
292.1	in terms of weight?
295.18	Because it's easy.
296.62	We can look at a photograph
296.62	and determine tonnage on a ship
300.14	by using a simple pocket calculator.
302.42	We can weigh trucks,
302.42	airplanes and oxcarts.
305.7	But what we care about
305.7	in food is nutritional value.
310.86	Not all foods are created equal,
314.02	even if they weigh the same.
316.74	This I learned firsthand
319.22	when I moved from Ethiopia
319.22	to the US for university.
323.02	Upon my return back home,
325.18	my father, who was so excited to see me,
328.42	greeted me by asking why I was fat.
332.78	Now, turns out that eating
338.58	approximately the same amount of food
338.58	as I did in Ethiopia, but in America,
343.46	had actually lent
343.46	a certain fullness to my figure.
348.58	This is why we should care about calories,
352.7	not about mass.
354.38	It is calories which sustain us.
358.7	So 214 trillion calories
358.7	is a very large number,
364.54	and not even the most dedicated of us
367.7	think in the hundreds
367.7	of trillions of calories.
370.66	So let me break this down differently.
373.7	An alternative way to think about this
377.06	is to think about it in Big Macs.
382.58	A single Big Mac has 563 calories.
385.82	That means the world will be short
392.06	That is more Big Macs
392.06	than McDonald's has ever produced.
397.78	So how did we get
397.78	to these numbers in the first place?
401.86	They're not made up.
404.22	This map shows you
404.22	where the world was 40 years ago.
409.06	It shows you net calorie gaps
409.06	in every country in the world.
413.1	Now, simply put,
414.58	this is just calories
414.58	consumed in that country
417.62	minus calories produced
417.62	in that same country.
420.7	This is not a statement
420.7	on malnutrition or anything else.
423.5	It's simply saying how many calories
423.5	are consumed in a single year
427.54	minus how many are produced.
429.42	Blue countries are net calorie exporters,
432.82	or self-sufficient.
434.22	They have some in storage for a rainy day.
436.9	Red countries are net calorie importers.
439.74	The deeper, the brighter the red,
441.7	the more you're importing.
	were net exporters of calories,
448.5	I could count them with one hand.
451.18	Most of the African continent,
453.3	Europe, most of Asia,
455.94	South America excluding Argentina,
457.98	were all net importers of calories.
460.38	And what's surprising is that China
460.38	used to actually be food self-sufficient.
464.5	India was a big net importer of calories.
471.78	You can see the drastic transformation
471.78	that's occurred in the world.
475.86	Brazil has emerged
475.86	as an agricultural powerhouse.
479.38	Europe is dominant in global agriculture.
482.66	India has actually flipped
482.66	from red to blue.
485.66	It's become food self-sufficient.
487.94	And China went from that light blue
490.42	to the brightest red
490.42	that you see on this map.
494.1	How did we get here? What happened?
497.78	So this chart shows you India and Africa.
501.26	Blue line is India, red line is Africa.
504.26	How is it that two regions
504.26	that started off so similarly
508.42	in such similar trajectories
510.58	take such different paths?
512.74	India had a green revolution.
515.82	Not a single African country
515.82	had a green revolution.
519.94	The net outcome?
521.18	India is food self-sufficient
522.9	and in the past decade
522.9	has actually been exporting calories.
526.3	The African continent now imports
526.3	over 300 trillion calories a year.
531.1	Then we add China, the green line.
535.42	Remember the switch
535.42	from the blue to the bright red?
538.94	What happened and when did it happen?
542.02	China seemed to be
542.02	on a very similar path to India
544.9	until the start of the 21st century,
547.7	where it suddenly flipped.
550.22	A young and growing population
552.26	combined with significant economic growth
555.38	made its mark with a big bang
557.82	and no one in the markets saw it coming.
561.34	This flip was everything
561.34	to global agricultural markets.
565.1	Luckily now, South America
567.94	was starting to boom
567.94	at the same time as China's rise,
573.18	and so therefore, supply and demand
573.18	were still somewhat balanced.
578.14	So the question becomes,
580.46	where do we go from here?
583.62	Oddly enough,
585.18	it's not a new story,
587.62	except this time
587.62	it's not just a story of China.
591.02	It's a continuation of China,
593.42	an amplification of Africa
595.54	and a paradigm shift in India.
598.42	By 2023,
600.82	Africa's population is forecasted
600.82	to overtake that of India's and China's.
605.9	By 2023, these three regions combined
608.58	will make up over half
608.58	the world's population.
613.22	This crossover point starts to present
613.22	really interesting challenges
617.26	for global food security.
619.02	And a few years later,
619.02	we're hit hard with that reality.
623.94	What does the world look like in 10 years?
628.94	So far, as I mentioned,
628.94	India has been food self-sufficient.
632.86	Most forecasters predict
632.86	that this will continue.
637.02	We disagree.
638.98	India will soon become
638.98	a net importer of calories.
643.14	This will be driven both by the fact
645.42	that demand is growing
645.42	from a population growth standpoint
648.94	plus economic growth.
650.22	It will be driven by both.
651.5	And even if you have
651.5	optimistic assumptions
654.22	around production growth,
656.14	it will make that slight flip.
658.78	That slight flip
658.78	can have huge implications.
663.62	Next, Africa will continue
663.62	to be a net importer of calories,
668.18	again driven by population growth
668.18	and economic growth.
671.94	This is again assuming optimistic
671.94	production growth assumptions.
675.86	Then China,
677.3	where population is flattening out,
679.9	calorie consumption will explode
681.9	because the types of calories consumed
684.94	are also starting to be
684.94	higher-calorie-content foods.
689.42	And so therefore,
691.18	these three regions combined
693.06	start to present a really interesting
693.06	challenge for the world.
696.38	Until now, countries with calorie deficits
700.5	have been able to meet these deficits
703.1	by importing from surplus regions.
705.54	By surplus regions, I'm talking about
708.38	North America, South America and Europe.
711.54	This line chart over here shows you
713.98	the growth and the projected growth
713.98	over the next decade of production
718.3	from North America,
718.3	South America and Europe.
720.62	What it doesn't show you
722.06	is that most of this growth is actually
722.06	going to come from South America.
726.46	And most of this growth
727.9	is going to come
727.9	at the huge cost of deforestation.
734.06	And so when you look
734.06	at the combined demand increase
737.86	coming from India, China
737.86	and the African continent,
742.02	and look at it versus
742.02	the combined increase in production
744.86	coming from India,
744.86	China, the African continent,
747.66	North America, South America and Europe,
751.1	you are left with
751.1	a 214-trillion-calorie deficit,
756.54	one we can't produce.
758.3	And this, by the way, is actually assuming
758.3	we take all the extra calories
762.26	produced in North America,
762.26	South America and Europe
765.7	and export them solely
765.7	to India, China and Africa.
771.02	What I just presented to you
771.02	is a vision of an impossible world.
775.34	We can do something to change that.
778.22	We can change consumption patterns,
780.54	we can reduce food waste,
782.82	or we can make a bold commitment
786.06	to increasing yields exponentially.
789.54	Now, I'm not going to go into discussing
791.7	changing consumption patterns
791.7	or reducing food waste,
794.22	because those conversations
794.22	have been going on for some time now.
797.3	Nothing has happened.
798.54	Nothing has happened
798.54	because those arguments
802.02	ask the surplus regions
802.02	to change their behavior
804.98	on behalf of deficit regions.
808.7	Waiting for others
808.7	to change their behavior
811.3	on your behalf, for your survival,
813.82	is a terrible idea.
815.34	It's unproductive.
817.38	So I'd like to suggest an alternative
817.38	that comes from the red regions.
823.78	China, India, Africa.
826.18	China is constrained in terms
826.18	of how much more land it actually has
829.5	available for agriculture,
831.06	and it has massive
831.06	water resource availability issues.
834.86	So the answer really lies
834.86	in India and in Africa.
839.66	India has some upside
839.66	in terms of potential yield increases.
844.62	Now this is the gap
844.62	between its current yield
847.22	and the theoretical
847.22	maximum yield it can achieve.
851.54	It has some unfarmed
851.54	arable land remaining, but not much,
854.78	India is quite land-constrained.
858.06	Now, the African continent,
858.06	on the other hand,
860.74	has vast amounts of arable land remaining
864.06	and significant
864.06	upside potential in yields.
867.9	Somewhat simplified picture here,
870.02	but if you look at sub-Saharan
870.02	African yields in corn today,
875.06	they are where North American
875.06	yields were in 1940.
880.42	We don't have 70-plus years
880.42	to figure this out,
884.18	so it means we need to try something new
886.74	and we need to try something different.
890.22	The solution starts with reforms.
893.7	We need to reform and commercialize
897.7	the agricultural industries in Africa
900.26	and in India.
902.14	Now, by commercialization --
904.3	commercialization is not
904.3	about commercial farming alone.
907.46	Commercialization is about leveraging data
910.06	to craft better policies,
912.38	to improve infrastructure,
914.02	to lower the transportation costs
915.9	and to completely reform
915.9	banking and insurance industries.
920.18	Commercialization
920.18	is about taking agriculture
923.3	from too risky an endeavor
923.3	to one where fortunes can be made.
927.42	Commercialization
927.42	is not about just farmers.
930.7	Commercialization is about
930.7	the entire agricultural system.
936.66	But commercialization
936.66	also means confronting the fact
940.74	that we can no longer place
940.74	the burden of growth
944.18	on small-scale farmers alone,
948.42	and accepting that commercial farms
948.42	and the introduction of commercial farms
953.7	could provide certain economies of scale
956.42	that even small-scale
956.42	farmers can leverage.
959.86	It is not about small-scale farming
959.86	or commercial agriculture,
963.86	or big agriculture.
965.74	We can create the first successful models
965.74	of the coexistence and success
971.02	of small-scale farming
971.02	alongside commercial agriculture.
974.82	This is because, for the first time ever,
977.86	the most critical tool
977.86	for success in the industry --
981.62	data and knowledge --
983.14	is becoming cheaper by the day.
986.54	And very soon, it won't matter
986.54	how much money you have
989.98	or how big you are
991.46	to make optimal decisions
991.46	and maximize probability of success
995.78	in reaching your intended goal.
999.14	Companies like Gro are working
999.14	really hard to make this a reality.
1003.42	So if we can commit
1003.42	to this new, bold initiative,
1008.02	to this new, bold change,
1010.06	not only can we solve
1010.06	the 214-trillion gap that I talked about,
1015.5	but we can actually set the world
1015.5	on a whole new path.
1018.78	India can remain food self-sufficient
1022.9	and Africa can emerge
1022.9	as the world's next dark blue region.
1029.06	The new question is,
1031.3	how do we produce 214 trillion calories
1035.46	to feed 8.3 billion people by 2027?
1040.58	We have the solution.
1042.78	We just need to act on it.
1045.34	Thank you.
1046.58	(Applause)
