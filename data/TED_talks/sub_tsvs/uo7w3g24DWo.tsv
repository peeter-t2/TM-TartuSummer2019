13.204	Good afternoon, I'm proud
13.204	to be here at TEDxKrakow.
16.329	I'll try to speak a little bit today
16.329	about a phenomenon
19.35	which can, and actually is
19.35	changing the world,
22.376	and whose name is people power.
24.392	I'll start with an anecdote,
25.924	or for those of you
25.924	who are Monty Python lovers,
29.071	a Monty Python type of sketch.
30.542	Here it is.
31.597	It is December 15, 2010.
34.756	Somebody gives you a bet:
34.756	you will look at a crystal ball,
38.262	and you will see the future;
38.262	the future will be accurate.
40.953	But you need to share it with the world.
42.897	OK, curiosity killed the cat,
42.897	you take the bet,
46.019	you look at the crystal ball.
47.553	One hour later, you're sitting
47.553	in a building of the national TV,
51.116	in a top show, and you tell the story.
53.672	Before the end of 2011,
56.78	Ben Ali, and Mubarak,
56.78	and Gaddafi would be down,
60.953	and prosecuted.
62.705	Saleh of Yemen and Assad of Syria
65.221	would be either challenged,
65.221	or already on their knees.
68.683	Osama bin Laden would be dead,
70.701	and Ratko Mladic would be in the Hague.
73.421	Now, the anchor watches you
73.421	with a strange gaze on his face.
76.991	And then, on top of it you add:
78.833	"""And thousands of young people"
78.833	from Athens, Madrid and New York
82.722	will demonstrate for social justice,
82.722	"claiming they are inspired by Arabs."""
88.007	Next thing you know,
88.007	two guys in white appear,
90.587	they give you the strange t-shirt,
92.825	take you to the nearest
92.825	mental institution.
94.904	So I would like to speak a little bit
96.791	about the phenomenon which is behind
96.791	what already seems to be
100.664	a very bad year for bad guys.
103.379	And this phenomenon
103.379	is called people power.
106.78	Well, people power
106.78	has been there for a while.
108.947	It helped Gandhi kick
108.947	the Brits from India,
111.942	it helped Martin Luther King
111.942	win his historic racial struggle.
116.073	It helped a local, Lech Walesa,
118.46	to kick out one million
118.46	Soviet troops from Poland,
121.88	and in beginning the end
121.88	of the Soviet Union as we know it.
125.102	So what's new in it?
127.157	What seems to be very new,
128.765	which is the idea I would like
128.765	to share with you today,
131.361	is that there is a set of rules and skills
133.823	which can be learned and taught
136.305	in order to perform
136.305	successful nonviolent struggle.
139.753	If this is true, we can help
139.753	these movements.
143.531	Well, the first one - analytic skills.
146.374	I'll try where it all started
146.374	in the Middle East.
149.224	And for so many years,
150.846	we were living with a completely wrong
150.846	perception of the Middle East.
155.274	It was looking like the frozen region.
157.201	Literally a refrigerator.
158.934	And there were only
158.934	two types of meal there.
161.401	Steak, which stands for a Mubarak-Ben Ali
161.401	type of military police dictatorship,
167.279	or a potato, which stands for
167.279	a Tehran type of theocracies.
170.957	And everybody was amazed
170.957	when the refrigerator opened,
174.291	and millions of young,
174.291	mainly secular people
177.246	stepped out to do the change.
179.32	Guess what - they didn't watch
179.32	the demographics.
182.731	What is the average age
182.731	of an Egyptian? 24.
185.147	How long was Mubarak in power? 31.
187.53	So, this system was just
187.53	obsolete, they expired.
191.437	And young people of the Arab world
191.437	have awakened one morning,
194.871	and understood that power
194.871	lies in their hands.
198.226	The rest is the year in front of us.
200.273	And guess what? The same Generation Y,
203.145	with their rules, with their tools,
203.145	with their games,
206.051	and with their language,
206.051	which sounds a little bit strange to me.
209.389	I'm 38 now.
211.257	And can you look at the age
211.257	of the people on the streets of Europe?
214.794	It seems that Generation Y is coming.
219.025	Now, let me set another example.
221.738	I'm meeting different people
221.738	throughout the world,
224.119	and they are, you know, academics,
224.119	and professors, and doctors,
227.27	and they will always talk conditions.
229.168	"They will say: ""People power will work"
229.168	"only if the regime is not too oppressive."""
233.221	"They will say: ""People power will work,"
235.23	if the annual income of the country
235.23	"is between X and Z."""
239.07	"They will say: ""People power will work"
239.07	"only if there is a foreign pressure."""
242.744	"They will say: ""People power"
242.744	"will work only if there is no oil."""
245.85	And, I mean, there is a set of conditions.
248.958	Well, the news here
248.958	is that your skills during the conflict
252.608	seem to be more important
252.608	than the conditions.
255.522	Namely, the skills of unity, planning,
255.522	and maintaining nonviolent discipline.
260.133	Let me give you an example.
261.546	I come from a country called Serbia.
263.631	It took us 10 years to unite
268.209	with their big egos,
268.209	behind one single candidate
271.613	against the Balkan dictator
271.613	Slobodan Milosevic.
274.264	Guess what? That was
274.264	the day of his defeat.
277.034	You look at the Egyptians,
277.034	they fight on Tahrir Square,
279.923	they get rid of their individual symbols,
282.007	they appear on the street
282.007	only with the flag of Egypt.
284.926	I will give you a counter-example.
286.967	You see nine presidential candidates
286.967	running against Lukashenko,
290.681	you all know the outcome.
292.284	So unity is a big thing.
294.398	And this can be achieved.
295.724	Same with planning.
296.93	Somebody has lied to you
298.325	about the successful and spontaneous
298.325	nonviolent revolution.
302.102	That thing doesn't exist in the world.
304.133	Whenever you see young people
304.133	in front of the row
307.006	trying to fraternize
307.006	with the police or military,
309.506	somebody was thinking about it before.
312.016	Now, at the end, nonviolent discipline.
314.229	And this is probably the game-changer.
316.722	If you maintain nonviolent discipline,
319.116	you'll exclusively win.
321.098	You have 100,000 people
321.098	in a nonviolent march,
323.582	one idiot or agent-provocateur
323.582	throwing a stone.
326.36	Guess what takes all the cameras.
328.094	That one guy.
329.212	One single act of violence
329.212	can literally destroy your movement.
333.564	Now, let me move to another place.
336.175	It's the selection
336.175	of strategies and tactics.
338.295	There are certain rules
338.295	in nonviolent struggle you may follow.
342.113	First, you start small.
343.765	Second, you pick the battles you can win.
347.181	It's only 200 of us in this room.
349.212	We won't call for the march of a million.
351.553	But what if we organized the spraying
351.553	of graffiti throughout the night,
355.001	all over Krakow.
356.432	The city will know.
357.6	So, we pick tactics
357.6	accommodated to the event,
360.925	especially this thing we call
360.925	the small tactics of dispersion.
364.996	They're very useful in violent oppression.
368.933	We are actually witnessing the picture
368.933	of one of the best tactics ever used.
373.153	It was on Tahrir square,
375.248	where the international community
375.248	was constantly frightened
378.548	that, you know, the Islamists
378.548	will overtake the revolution.
381.735	What they organized --
383.132	Christians protecting Muslims
383.132	where they are praying,
385.633	a Coptic wedding cheered
385.633	by thousands of Muslims,
388.245	the world has just changed the picture,
390.289	but somebody was thinking
390.289	about this previously.
393.313	So there are so many things you can do
395.267	instead of getting into one place,
397.608	shouting, and you know, showing off
397.608	in front of the security forces.
403.013	Now, there is also another
403.013	very important dynamic.
405.983	And this is a dynamic
405.983	that analysts normally don't see.
409.26	This is the dynamic between
409.26	fear and apathy on the one side,
412.981	and enthusiasm and humor on another side.
415.917	So, it works like in a video game.
417.671	You have the fear high,
417.671	you have status quo.
420.079	You have the enthusiasm higher,
422.167	you see the fear is starting to melt.
424.001	Day two, you see people
424.001	running towards the police
426.747	instead of from the police, in Egypt.
429.332	You can tell that something
429.332	is happening there.
431.936	And then, it's about the humor.
433.945	Humor is such a powerful game-changer,
436.452	and of course, it was very big in Poland.
438.449	You know, we were just a small group
438.449	of crazy students in Serbia
442.016	when we made this big skit.
444.156	We put the big petrol barrel
446.625	with a portrait of Mr. President on it,
446.625	in the middle of the Main Street.
451.312	There was a hole in the top.
452.917	So you could literally come,
452.917	put a coin in,
455.702	get a baseball bat, and hit his face.
459.18	Sounds loud.
460.861	And within minutes,
462.161	we were sitting in a nearby caf√©
462.161	having coffee,
464.542	and there was a queue of people
464.542	waiting to do this lovely thing.
468.82	Well, that's just
468.82	the beginning of the show.
470.892	The real show starts
470.892	when the police appears.
473.049	(Laughter)
474.294	"""What will they do?"""
475.452	Arrest us? We were nowhere to be seen.
477.368	We were like three blocks away,
477.368	observing it from our espresso bar.
481.207	Arrest the shoppers, with kids?
483.155	Doesn't make sense.
484.385	Of course, you could bet,
484.385	they did the most stupid thing.
487.076	They arrested the barrel.
488.648	And now, the picture
488.648	of the smashed face on the barrel,
491.59	with the policemen
491.59	dragging it to the police car,
493.924	that was the best day
493.924	for newspaper photographers
497.147	that they will ever have.
498.851	So, I mean, these are
498.851	the things you can do.
501.092	And you can always use humor.
502.515	There is also one big thing about humor,
504.814	it really hurts.
506.117	Because these guys really are
506.117	taking themselves too seriously.
510.25	When you start to mock them, it hurts.
513.393	Now, everybody is talking
513.393	about His Majesty, the Internet,
517.043	and it is also a very useful skill.
519.279	But don't rush to label things
519.279	"like ""a Facebook Revolution,"""
523.438	"""Twitter Revolution."""
524.616	Don't mix the tools
524.616	with the substance.
527.999	It is true that the Internet
527.999	and the new media are very useful
531.477	in making things faster and cheaper.
534.034	They also make it a bit safer
534.034	for the participants,
536.881	because they give partial anonymity.
539.175	We're watching the great example
539.175	of something else the Internet can do.
542.825	It can put the price tag
542.825	of state-sponsored violence
546.376	over a nonviolent protester.
547.995	This is the famous group
547.995	"""We are all Khaled Said,"""
550.495	made by Wael Ghonim
550.495	in Egypt, and his friend.
552.836	This is the mutilated face of the guy
552.836	who was beaten by the police.
556.723	This is how he became known to the public,
558.747	and this is what probably became
558.747	the straw that broke the camel's back.
562.882	But here is also the bad news.
564.597	The nonviolent struggle is won
564.597	in the real world, in the streets.
568.301	You will never change
568.301	your society towards democracy,
572.492	or, you know, the economy,
572.492	if you sit down and click.
575.905	There are risks to be taken,
577.346	and there are living people
577.346	who are winning the struggle.
581.071	Well, the million-dollar question.
582.761	What will happen in the Arab world?
584.692	And though young people
584.692	from the Arab world
586.716	were pretty successful
586.716	in bringing down three dictators,
589.988	shaking the region,
592.408	kind of persuading the clever kings
592.408	from Jordan and Morocco
595.587	to do substantial reforms,
597.406	it is yet to be seen
597.406	what will be the outcome.
601.487	Whether the Egyptians and Tunisians
601.487	will make it through the transition,
605.436	or this will end in bloody
605.436	ethnic and religious conflicts,
609.071	whether the Syrians
609.071	will maintain nonviolent discipline,
614.317	faced with a brutal daily violence
614.317	which kills thousands already,
618.141	or they will slip into violent struggle
620.276	and make ugly civil war.
624.689	Will these revolutions be pushed
624.689	through the transitions and democracy
628.691	or be overtaken by the military
628.691	or extremists of all kinds?
632.8	We cannot tell.
634.894	The same works for the Western sector,
636.919	where you can see
636.919	all these excited young people
639.209	protesting around the world,
639.209	occupying this, occupying that.
643.538	Are they going to become the world wave?
646.309	Are they going to find their skills,
646.309	their enthusiasm, and their strategy
651.968	to find what they really want
651.968	and push for the reform,
655.262	or will they just stay complaining
655.262	about the endless list
659.515	of the things they hate?
661.982	This is the difference
661.982	between the two paths.
664.774	Now, what do the statistics have?
667.597	My friend Maria Stephan's book
670.215	talks a lot about violent
670.215	and nonviolent struggle,
672.939	and there are some shocking data.
675.59	If you look at the last 35 years
675.59	and different social transitions,
679.876	from dictatorship to democracy,
681.742	you will see that,
681.742	out of 67 different cases,
685.095	in 50 of these cases
685.095	it was nonviolent struggle
688.729	which was the key power.
691.809	This is one more reason
691.809	to look at this phenomenon,
694.452	this is one more reason
694.452	to look at Generation Y.
698.013	Enough for me to give them credit,
700.089	and hope that they will find their skills
700.089	and their courage
704.981	to use nonviolent struggle
706.668	and thus fix at least a part of the mess
706.668	our generation is making in this world.
711.765	Thank you.
712.852	(Applause)
