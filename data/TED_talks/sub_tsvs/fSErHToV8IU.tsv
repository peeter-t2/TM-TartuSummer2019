12.713	I'm going to be showing some of the cybercriminals'
14.345	latest and nastiest creations.
16.807	So basically, please don't go and download
19.715	any of the viruses that I show you.
22.411	Some of you might be wondering what a cybersecurity specialist looks like,
25.429	and I thought I'd give you a quick insight
27.598	into my career so far.
30.276	It's a pretty accurate description.
32.777	This is what someone that specializes
34.433	in malware and hacking looks like.
36.853	So today, computer viruses and trojans,
40.267	designed to do everything from stealing data
43.147	to watching you in your webcam
45.188	to the theft of billions of dollars.
47.966	Some malicious code today goes as far
50.161	as targeting power, utilities and infrastructure.
54.304	Let me give you a quick snapshot
56.265	of what malicious code is capable of today.
58.879	Right now, every second, eight new users
61.949	are joining the Internet.
64.104	Today, we will see 250,000 individual new computer viruses.
71.412	We will see 30,000 new infected websites.
77.185	And, just to kind of tear down a myth here,
79.271	lots of people think that when you get infected
81.759	with a computer virus, it's because you went to a porn site.
85.21	Right? Well, actually, statistically speaking,
87.653	if you only visit porn sites, you're safer.
90.778	People normally write that down, by the way. (Laughter)
93.78	Actually, about 80 percent of these
95.342	are small business websites getting infected.
98.855	Today's cybercriminal, what do they look like?
101.14	Well, many of you have the image, don't you,
103.566	of the spotty teenager sitting in a basement,
105.742	hacking away for notoriety.
108.13	But actually today, cybercriminals
109.753	are wonderfully professional and organized.
113.064	In fact, they have product adverts.
115.935	You can go online and buy a hacking service
118.066	to knock your business competitor offline.
120.215	Check out this one I found.
121.774	(Video) Man: So you're here for one reason,
123.593	and that reason is
125.058	because you need your business competitors,
126.97	rivals, haters, or whatever the reason is, or who,
130.922	they are to go down.
132.666	Well you, my friend, you've came to the right place.
135.526	If you want your business competitors to go down,
137.942	well, they can.
139.278	If you want your rivals to go offline, well, they will.
142.702	Not only that, we are providing a short-term-to-long-term
145.729	DDOS service or scheduled attack,
148.084	starting five dollars per hour for small personal websites
151.895	to 10 to 50 dollars per hour.
154.799	James Lyne: Now, I did actually pay
156.122	one of these cybercriminals to attack my own website.
158.915	Things got a bit tricky when I tried to expense it at the company.
162.409	Turns out that's not cool.
164.123	But regardless, it's amazing how many products
167.133	and services are available now to cybercriminals.
170.245	For example, this testing platform,
172.721	which enables the cybercriminals
174.436	to test the quality of their viruses
176.918	before they release them on the world.
179.37	For a small fee, they can upload it
181.327	and make sure everything is good.
182.993	But it goes further.
184.526	Cybercriminals now have crime packs
186.771	with business intelligence reporting dashboards
189.89	to manage the distribution of their malicious code.
193.366	This is the market leader in malware distribution,
196.894	the Black Hole Exploit Pack,
198.532	responsible for nearly one third of malware distribution
202.191	in the last couple of quarters.
204.165	It comes with technical installation guides,
207.174	video setup routines,
208.219	and get this, technical support.
212.174	You can email the cybercriminals and they'll tell you
214.562	how to set up your illegal hacking server.
218.184	So let me show you what malicious code looks like today.
222.468	What I've got here is two systems,
224.78	an attacker, which I've made look all Matrix-y and scary,
228.47	and a victim, which you might recognize from home or work.
231.772	Now normally, these would be on different sides
234.501	of the planet or of the Internet,
237.056	but I've put them side by side
238.452	because it makes things much more interesting.
241.116	Now, there are many ways you can get infected.
243.171	You will have come in contact with some of them.
245.763	Maybe some of you have received an email
247.859	"that says something like, ""Hi, I'm a Nigerian banker,"
251.944	and I'd like to give you 53 billion dollars
254.708	"because I like your face."""
257.135	Or funnycats.exe, which rumor has it
260.529	was quite successful in China's recent campaign against America.
264.298	Now there are many ways you can get infected.
266.728	I want to show you a couple of my favorites.
268.715	This is a little USB key.
271.375	Now how do you get a USB key to run in a business?
273.532	Well, you could try looking really cute.
277.657	Awww.
279.595	Or, in my case, awkward and pathetic.
281.958	So imagine this scenario: I walk into one of your businesses,
286.147	looking very awkward and pathetic, with a copy of my C.V.
288.989	which I've covered in coffee,
290.888	and I ask the receptionist to plug in this USB key
294.275	and print me a new one.
296.224	So let's have a look here on my victim computer.
299.454	What I'm going to do is plug in the USB key.
302.7	After a couple of seconds,
304.19	things start to happen on the computer on their own,
306.941	usually a bad sign.
308.876	This would, of course, normally happen
310.57	in a couple of seconds, really, really quickly,
313.328	but I've kind of slowed it down
314.988	so you can actually see the attack occurring.
317.818	Malware is very boring otherwise.
320.335	So this is writing out the malicious code,
322.932	and a few seconds later, on the left-hand side,
326.729	you'll see the attacker's screen get some interesting new text.
331.027	Now if I place the mouse cursor over it,
332.958	this is what we call a command prompt,
335.265	and using this we can navigate around the computer.
339.062	We can access your documents, your data.
341.221	You can turn on the webcam.
342.722	That can be very embarrassing.
344.351	Or just to really prove a point,
346.074	we can launch programs like my personal favorite,
349.195	the Windows Calculator.
352	So isn't it amazing how much control
354.288	the attackers can get with such a simple operation?
357.183	Let me show you how most malware
359.114	is now distributed today.
361.297	What I'm going to do is open up a website
363.817	that I wrote.
365.133	It's a terrible website. It's got really awful graphics.
369.448	And it's got a comments section here
371.642	where we can submit comments to the website.
375.323	Many of you will have used something a bit like this before.
378.33	Unfortunately, when this was implemented,
380.277	the developer was slightly inebriated
382.702	and managed to forget
383.944	all of the secure coding practices he had learned.
386.933	So let's imagine that our attacker,
389.999	called Evil Hacker just for comedy value,
393.447	inserts something a little nasty.
395.47	This is a script.
397.169	It's code which will be interpreted on the webpage.
401.246	So I'm going to submit this post,
403.571	and then, on my victim computer,
405.953	I'm going to open up the web browser
407.98	and browse to my website,
410.233	www.incrediblyhacked.com.
414.022	Notice that after a couple of seconds,
416.146	I get redirected.
417.603	That website address at the top there,
419.58	which you can just about see, microshaft.com,
422.911	the browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs,
426.104	and up pops fake antivirus.
430.128	This is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software,
435.184	and it will go through and it will scan the system,
437.549	have a look at what its popping up here.
439.057	It creates some very serious alerts.
440.805	Oh look, a child porn proxy server.
443.148	We really should clean that up.
445.58	What's really insulting about this is
447.164	not only does it provide the attackers with access to your data,
451.402	but when the scan finishes, they tell you
454.225	in order to clean up the fake viruses,
457.348	you have to register the product.
460.024	Now I liked it better when viruses were free.
463.36	(Laughter)
466.139	People now pay cybercriminals money
468.665	to run viruses,
470.766	which I find utterly bizarre.
473.527	So anyway, let me change pace a little bit.
477.063	Chasing 250,000 pieces of malware a day
480.569	is a massive challenge,
482.224	and those numbers are only growing
484.294	directly in proportion to the length of my stress line, you'll note here.
488.173	So I want to talk to you briefly
490.049	about a group of hackers we tracked for a year
493.099	and actually found --
495.106	and this is a rare treat in our job.
497.683	Now this was a cross-industry collaboration,
500.166	people from Facebook, independent researchers,
502.555	guys from Sophos.
504.636	So here we have a couple of documents
507.291	which our cybercriminals had uploaded
510.117	to a cloud service, kind of like Dropbox or SkyDrive,
514.494	like many of you might use.
516.703	At the top, you'll notice a section of source code.
520.095	What this would do is send the cybercriminals
523.063	a text message every day telling them how much money
528.103	they'd made that day,
529.769	so a kind of cybercriminal billings report, if you will.
533.065	If you look closely, you'll notice a series
535.822	of what are Russian telephone numbers.
538.805	Now that's obviously interesting,
540.284	because that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals.
543.521	Down below, highlighted in red,
545.636	in the other section of source code,
547.387	"is this bit ""leded:leded."""
550.13	That's a username,
551.419	kind of like you might have on Twitter.
554.278	So let's take this a little further.
555.509	There are a few other interesting pieces
557.767	the cybercriminals had uploaded.
560.042	Lots of you here will use smartphones
562.614	to take photos and post them from the conference.
565.261	An interesting feature of lots of modern smartphones
568.098	is that when you take a photo,
569.765	it embeds GPS data about where that photo was taken.
574.002	In fact, I've been spending a lot of time
576.445	on Internet dating sites recently,
578.689	obviously for research purposes,
581.1	and I've noticed that about 60 percent
584.621	of the profile pictures on Internet dating sites
587.444	contain the GPS coordinates of where the photo was taken,
591.895	which is kind of scary
592.956	because you wouldn't give out your home address
595.518	to lots of strangers,
596.967	but we're happy to give away our GPS coordinates
598.961	to plus or minus 15 meters.
602.99	And our cybercriminals had done the same thing.
606.224	So here's a photo which resolves to St. Petersburg.
609.428	We then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool.
613.114	We used Google.
615.509	Using the email address, the telephone number
617.734	and the GPS data, on the left you see an advert
621.283	for a BMW that one of our cybercriminals is selling,
624.952	on the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens.
630.3	One of these was more stereotypical for me.
633.4	A little more searching, and here's our cybercriminal.
637.389	Imagine, these are hardened cybercriminals
640.935	sharing information scarcely.
642.803	Imagine what you could find
643.951	about each of the people in this room.
645.654	A bit more searching through the profile
647.46	and there's a photo of their office.
649.32	They were working on the third floor.
651.368	And you can also see some photos
653.567	from his business companion
654.742	where he has a taste in a certain kind of image.
659.581	It turns out he's a member of the Russian Adult Webmasters Federation.
663.576	But this is where our investigation starts to slow down.
666.593	The cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well.
670.536	And herein is the greatest lesson
672.571	of social media and mobile devices for all of us right now.
677.149	Our friends, our families and our colleagues
680.879	can break our security even when we do the right things.
685.568	This is MobSoft, one of the companies
688.348	that this cybercriminal gang owned,
690.514	and an interesting thing about MobSoft
692.103	is the 50-percent owner of this
694.974	posted a job advert,
696.921	and this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers
700.301	from the code earlier.
702.453	This woman was Maria,
704.578	and Maria is the wife of one of our cybercriminals.
707.458	And it's kind of like she went into her social media settings
710.978	and clicked on every option imaginable
713.773	to make herself really, really insecure.
717.47	By the end of the investigation,
719.037	where you can read the full 27-page report at that link,
722.596	we had photos of the cybercriminals,
724.63	even the office Christmas party
727.525	when they were out on an outing.
729.391	That's right, cybercriminals do have Christmas parties,
732.64	as it turns out.
734.228	Now you're probably wondering what happened to these guys.
736.463	Let me come back to that in just a minute.
739.4	I want to change pace to one last little demonstration,
742.147	a technique that is wonderfully simple and basic,
746.116	but is interesting in exposing how much information
749.181	we're all giving away,
750.957	and it's relevant because it applies to us as a TED audience.
755.235	This is normally when people start kind of shuffling in their pockets
757.685	trying to turn their phones onto airplane mode desperately.
761.903	Many of you all know about the concept
763.589	of scanning for wireless networks.
765.932	You do it every time you take out your iPhone or your Blackberry
769.333	and connect to something like TEDAttendees.
773.353	But what you might not know
775.1	is that you're also beaming out a list of networks
779.851	you've previously connected to,
782.273	even when you're not using wireless actively.
786.42	So I ran a little scan.
788.147	I was relatively inhibited compared to the cybercriminals,
791.073	who wouldn't be so concerned by law,
793.617	and here you can see my mobile device.
796.204	Okay? So you can see a list of wireless networks.
798.858	TEDAttendees, HyattLB. Where do you think I'm staying?
803.485	My home network, PrettyFlyForAWifi,
806.978	which I think is a great name.
808.743	Sophos_Visitors, SANSEMEA, companies I work with.
811.51	Loganwifi, that's in Boston. HiltonLondon.
814.818	CIASurveillanceVan.
817.259	We called it that at one of our conferences
818.868	because we thought that would freak people out,
820.604	which is quite fun.
822.598	This is how geeks party.
827.256	So let's make this a little bit more interesting.
829.463	Let's talk about you.
832.001	Twenty-three percent of you have been to Starbucks
834.111	recently and used the wireless network.
837.226	Things get more interesting.
838.39	Forty-six percent of you I could link to a business,
840.836	XYZ Employee network.
843.706	This isn't an exact science, but it gets pretty accurate.
847.885	Seven hundred and sixty-one of you I could identify a hotel you'd been to recently,
852.354	absolutely with pinpoint precision somewhere on the globe.
856.193	Two hundred and thirty-four of you, well, I know where you live.
860.141	Your wireless network name is so unique
862.46	that I was able to pinpoint it
864.009	using data available openly on the Internet
866.676	with no hacking or clever, clever tricks.
870.924	And I should mention as well that
872.744	some of you do use your names,
874.286	"""James Lyne's iPhone,"" for example."
876.882	And two percent of you have a tendency to extreme profanity.
881.24	So something for you to think about:
883.244	As we adopt these new applications and mobile devices,
887.157	as we play with these shiny new toys,
889.474	how much are we trading off convenience
893.296	for privacy and security?
896.186	Next time you install something,
898.244	look at the settings and ask yourself,
900.548	"""Is this information that I want to share?"
904.1	"Would someone be able to abuse it?"""
906.99	We also need to think very carefully
909.062	about how we develop our future talent pool.
913.203	You see, technology's changing at a staggering rate,
916.182	and that 250,000 pieces of malware
919.358	won't stay the same for long.
922.23	There's a very concerning trend
924.428	that whilst many people coming out of schools now
927.621	are much more technology-savvy, they know how to use technology,
932.033	fewer and fewer people are following the feeder subjects
935.646	to know how that technology works under the covers.
939.97	In the U.K., a 60 percent reduction since 2003,
944.355	and there are similar statistics all over the world.
948.13	We also need to think about the legal issues in this area.
952.206	The cybercriminals I talked about,
953.733	despite theft of millions of dollars,
955.872	actually still haven't been arrested,
957.981	and at this point possibly never will.
961.54	Most laws are national in their implementation,
965.04	despite cybercrime conventions, where the Internet
969.039	is borderless and international by definition.
972.145	Countries do not agree, which makes this area
974.978	exceptionally challenging from a legal perspective.
978.595	But my biggest ask is this:
982.955	You see, you're going to leave here
984.597	and you're going to see some astonishing stories in the news.
988.314	You're going to read about malware doing incredible
990.488	and terrifying, scary things.
993.749	However, 99 percent of it works
997.678	because people fail to do the basics.
1001.868	So my ask is this: Go online,
1004.89	find these simple best practices,
1007.535	find out how to update and patch your computer.
1010.089	Get a secure password.
1011.64	Make sure you use a different password
1013.17	on each of your sites and services online.
1016.521	Find these resources. Apply them.
1019.764	The Internet is a fantastic resource
1022.375	for business, for political expression,
1024.44	for art and for learning.
1026.771	Help me and the security community
1029.953	make life much, much more difficult
1033.421	for cybercriminals.
1035.373	Thank you.
1036.701	(Applause)
