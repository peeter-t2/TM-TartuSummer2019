12.868	The most complex problems in our time
16.196	can be solved with simple techniques,
19.166	if we are able to dream.
22.991	As a child, I discovered
22.991	that creativity is the key
27.976	to cross from dreams to reality.
33.57	I learned this from my grandmother,
35.907	Dr. Ruth Tichauer,
38.3	a Jewish refugee that settled
38.3	in the heart of the Andes.
43.729	That is how I grew up:
46.442	encouraged to see beyond any limitation.
50.982	So part of my education
50.982	included helping her
54.43	in remote, indigenous communities.
57.864	I cherish those memories,
60.113	because they helped me
60.113	to understand life outside the city,
67.04	a life with a lot of possibilities,
70.418	without barriers, as language or culture.
73.78	During those trips, my grandmother
73.78	used to recite a Kipling poem:
78.687	"""Something hidden. Go and find it."
82.296	Go and look behind the Mountains.
84.978	Something lost behind the mountains.
88.757	"Lost and waiting for you. Go!"""
93.624	In the coming years,
93.624	I became a medical student.
98.299	One of every hundred
98.299	children born worldwide
103.547	has some kind of heart disease.
107.214	There's a part of this problem
107.214	I think I can solve --
112.388	the part of this problem
112.388	I have spent my life working on.
119.904	The problem starts
122.279	during pregnancy.
124.61	The fetus needs to survive
124.61	inside the mother.
128.808	Survival depends on communication
133.321	between the systemic
133.321	and the pulmonary blood.
136.994	At the moment of birth,
139.055	this communication needs to stop.
142.474	If it doesn't close, the baby
142.474	has a hole in the heart.
147.398	It is caused by prematurity
147.398	and genetic conditions.
152.537	But what we know today
155.556	is that a lack of oxygen
155.556	is also one of the causes.
161.119	As you can see in the chart,
163.775	the frequency of this kind of hole
168.387	dramatically increases with altitude.
172.327	Video: (Baby crying)
176.357	When you look at patients
176.357	with this condition,
179.649	they seem desperate to breathe.
182.521	To close the hole, major surgery
182.521	used to be the only solution.
188.527	One night, my friend Malte,
188.527	were camping in the Amazon region.
194.385	The only thing that would not burn
194.385	in the fire was a green avocado branch.
201.088	Then came a moment of inspiration.
204.513	So we used the branch as a mold
204.513	for our first invention.
209.11	The holes in children's hearts
209.11	can be closed with it.
212.509	A coil is a piece of wire
212.509	wrapped onto itself.
217.313	It maybe doesn't look so fancy to you now,
220.76	but that was our first successful attempt
224.989	to create a device for this major problem.
229.671	In this video, we can see
229.671	how a very tiny catheter
232.832	takes the coil to the heart.
235.393	The coil then closes the hole.
237.721	After that moment of inspiration,
240.55	there came a very long time of effort
246.533	developing a prototype.
248.495	In vitro and in vivo studies took
248.495	thousands of hours of work in the lab.
255.321	The coil, if it works, can save lives.
260.202	I returned from Germany to Bolivia,
262.638	thinking that wherever we go,
265.166	we have the opportunity
265.166	to make a difference.
269.278	With my wife and partner,
269.278	Dr. Alexandra Heath,
273.802	we started to see patients.
275.492	After successfully treating
275.492	patients with our coil,
279.817	we felt really enthusiastic.
282.688	But we live in a place
286.554	that is 12,000 feet high.
291.694	And,
294.284	the patients there need a special device
294.284	to solve their heart condition.
299.865	The hole in altitude
299.865	patients is different,
302.352	because the orifice
302.352	between the arteries is larger.
306.479	Most patients cannot afford
306.479	to be treated on time,
311.405	and they die.
313.973	The first coil could successfully treat
317.616	only half of the patients in Bolivia.
323.577	The search started again.
326.942	We went back to the drawing board.
331.574	After many trials,
333.031	and with the help of my grandmother's
333.031	indigenous friends in the mountains,
338.078	we obtained a new device.
340.753	For centuries, indigenous women
340.753	told stories by weaving complex patterns
346.631	on looms,
348.262	and an unexpected skill
348.262	helped us for the new device.
353.673	We take this traditional method of weaving
356.507	and make a design made by a smart material
360.927	that records shape.
363.236	It seems this time,
365.755	the weaving allows us
365.755	to create a seamless device
370.506	that doesn't rust
373.072	because it's made of only one piece.
377.427	It can change by itself
377.427	into very complex structures
381.931	by a procedure that took
381.931	decades to develop.
386.903	As you can see, the device enters the body
389.746	through the natural channels.
392.173	Doctors have only to close
392.173	the catheter through the hole.
396.104	Our device expands, places itself
398.972	and closes the hole.
402.375	We have this beautiful delivery system
405.315	that is so simple to use
407.383	because it works by itself.
410.422	No open surgery was necessary.
415.494	(Applause)
424.006	As doctors, we fight with diseases
426.713	that take a long time
426.713	and effort to heal -- if they do.
431.443	This is the child from before,
434.1	after the procedure.
435.78	As you can see --
437.423	(Applause)
442.007	As you can see,
442.007	once the device is in place,
445.13	the patient is 100 percent healed.
448.622	From start to finish,
450.075	the whole procedure takes only 30 minutes.
455.183	That's very rewarding from the medical
455.183	and human point of view.
460.444	We are so proud that some
460.444	of our former patients
467.011	are part of our team --
470.643	a team, thanks to added close interaction
474.491	with patients that work with us.
477.799	Together, we have only one idea:
481.103	the best solutions need to be simple.
485.53	We lost the fear
485.53	of creating something new.
489.523	The path, it's not easy.
492.191	Many obstacles arise all the time.
495.934	But we receive strength from our patients.
499.971	Their resilience and courage
504.233	inspire our creativity.
507.311	Our goal is to make sure
510.282	that no child is left behind,
514.36	not because of cost or access.
519.367	So we have to start a foundation
522.355	with a one-to-one model.
525.831	We will give one device for free
529.061	to make sure that every child is treated.
533.6	We are in many countries now,
536.482	but we need to be everywhere.
540.926	This whole thing began
543.931	with one impossible idea
546.819	as will continue it, really:
550.698	No child is left behind.
555.67	Muchas gracias.
557.498	(Applause)
