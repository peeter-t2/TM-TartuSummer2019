16.228	I moved to Boston
19.545	with an interest in cancer
19.545	and in chemistry.
22.633	You might know that chemistry
22.633	is the science of making molecules
25.952	or, to my taste,
27.292	new drugs for cancer.
29.439	And you might also know that,
29.439	for science and medicine,
32.26	Boston is a bit of a candy store.
35.767	You can't roll a stop sign in Cambridge
35.767	without hitting a graduate student.
40.414	The bar is called the Miracle of Science.
42.993	"The billboards say ""Lab Space Available."""
46.656	And it's fair to say
46.656	that in these 10 years,
48.839	we've witnessed absolutely the start
48.839	of a scientific revolution --
53.17	that of genome medicine.
55.035	We know more about the patients
55.035	that enter our clinic now
57.789	than ever before.
58.972	And we're able, finally,
58.972	to answer the question
61.22	that's been so pressing for so many years:
63.608	Why do I have cancer?
66.675	This information
66.675	is also pretty staggering.
69.215	You might know that, so far,
69.215	in just the dawn of this revolution,
72.332	we know that there are perhaps
76.082	affecting more than 10,000 genes,
78.717	and that there are 500 of these genes
78.717	that are bona-fide drivers,
82.104	causes of cancer.
85.094	Yet comparatively,
86.313	we have about a dozen
86.313	targeted medications.
89.972	And this inadequacy of cancer medicine
92.258	really hit home when my father
92.258	was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
98.21	We didn't fly him to Boston.
99.895	We didn't sequence his genome.
101.807	It's been known for decades
101.807	what causes this malignancy.
106.363	It's three proteins: ras, myc, p53.
110.937	This is old information
110.937	we've known since about the 80s,
113.659	yet there's no medicine I can prescribe
115.603	to a patient with this
115.603	or any of the numerous solid tumors
119.19	caused by these three ...
121.841	Horsemen of the Apocalypse that is cancer.
124.539	There's no ras, no myc, no p53 drug.
127.356	And you might fairly ask: Why is that?
130.309	And the very unsatisfying
130.309	yet scientific answer is:
133.166	it's too hard.
134.88	That for whatever reason,
136.174	these three proteins have entered
136.174	a space, in the language of our field,
139.691	that's called the undruggable genome --
141.915	which is like calling
141.915	a computer unsurfable
144.229	or the Moon unwalkable.
145.509	It's a horrible term of trade.
147.641	But what it means
148.823	is that we've failed to identify
148.823	a greasy pocket in these proteins,
152.069	into which we, like molecular locksmiths,
154.363	can fashion an active, small,
154.363	organic molecule or drug substance.
160.034	Now, as I was training
160.034	in clinical medicine
162.491	and hematology and oncology
162.491	and stem-cell transplantation,
165.976	what we had instead,
167.873	cascading through the regulatory
167.873	network at the FDA,
171.412	were these substances:
172.869	arsenic,
174.202	thalidomide,
175.391	and this chemical derivative
175.391	of nitrogen mustard gas.
178.772	And this is the 21st century.
181.405	And so, I guess you'd say,
182.675	dissatisfied with the performance
182.675	and quality of these medicines,
185.836	I went back to school, in chemistry,
189.309	with the idea that perhaps by learning
189.309	the trade of discovery chemistry
193.992	and approaching it in the context
193.992	of this brave new world
196.889	of the open source,
199.125	the crowd source,
200.577	the collaborative network
200.577	that we have access to within academia,
203.906	that we might more quickly bring
203.906	powerful and targeted therapies
208.208	to our patients.
209.951	And so, please consider
209.951	this a work in progress,
213.075	but I'd like to tell you today a story
215.116	about a very rare cancer
215.116	called midline carcinoma,
219.119	about the undruggable protein target
219.119	that causes this cancer,
223.357	called BRD4,
224.909	and about a molecule developed at my lab
224.909	at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,
228.778	called JQ1,
229.954	which we affectionately named for Jun Qi,
232.2	the chemist that made this molecule.
234.969	Now, BRD4 is an interesting protein.
237.689	You might ask: with all the things
237.689	cancer's trying to do to kill our patient,
241.394	how does it remember it's cancer?
243.006	When it winds up its genome,
244.461	divides into two cells and unwinds again,
246.856	why does it not turn
246.856	into an eye, into a liver,
249.117	as it has all the genes
249.117	necessary to do this?
251.522	It remembers that it's cancer.
253.948	And the reason is that cancer,
253.948	like every cell in the body,
257.06	places little molecular bookmarks,
259.06	little Post-it notes,
260.462	"that remind the cell, ""I'm cancer;"
260.462	"I should keep growing."""
264.06	And those Post-it notes involve this
264.06	and other proteins of its class --
268.097	so-called bromodomains.
269.992	So we developed an idea, a rationale,
272.684	that perhaps if we made a molecule
274.857	that prevented
274.857	the Post-it note from sticking
277.174	by entering into the little pocket
278.857	at the base of this spinning protein,
280.737	then maybe we could convince cancer cells,
282.817	certainly those addicted
282.817	to this BRD4 protein,
285.642	that they're not cancer.
287.678	And so we started to work on this problem.
289.925	We developed libraries of compounds
292.251	and eventually arrived
292.251	at this and similar substances
295.06	called JQ1.
296.837	Now, not being a drug company,
298.425	we could do certain things,
298.425	we had certain flexibilities,
301.543	that I respect that a pharmaceutical
301.543	industry doesn't have.
304.401	We just started mailing it to our friends.
307.143	I have a small lab.
308.32	We thought we'd just send it to people
308.32	and see how the molecule behaves.
311.749	We sent it to Oxford, England,
313.223	where a group of talented
313.223	crystallographers provided this picture,
316.469	which helped us understand exactly
316.469	how this molecule is so potent
319.59	for this protein target.
320.78	It's what we call a perfect fit
320.78	of shape complementarity,
323.74	or hand in glove.
325.587	Now, this is a very rare cancer,
327.232	this BRD4-addicted cancer.
329.461	And so we worked with samples of material
331.716	that were collected by young pathologists
331.716	at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
335.314	And as we treated these cells
335.314	with this molecule,
337.711	we observed something really striking.
340.06	The cancer cells --
341.29	small, round and rapidly dividing,
343.381	grew these arms and extensions.
345.758	They were changing shape.
347.58	In effect,
348.931	the cancer cell
348.931	was forgetting it was cancer
352.262	and becoming a normal cell.
355.336	This got us very excited.
358.101	The next step would be to put
358.101	this molecule into mice.
360.713	The only problem was there's no
360.713	mouse model of this rare cancer.
364.132	And so at the time
364.132	we were doing this research,
366.879	I was caring for a 29-year-old
366.879	firefighter from Connecticut
370.476	who was very much at the end of life
372.382	with this incurable cancer.
374.881	This BRD4-addicted cancer
374.881	was growing throughout his left lung.
378.355	And he had a chest tube in
378.355	that was draining little bits of debris.
381.544	And every nursing shift,
381.544	we would throw this material out.
384.529	And so we approached this patient
386.32	and asked if he would collaborate with us.
388.975	Could we take this precious
388.975	and rare cancerous material
392.698	from this chest tube
394.321	and drive it across town
394.321	and put it into mice
396.564	and try to do a clinical trial
396.564	at a stage that with a prototype drug,
400.229	well, that would be, of course, impossible
402.277	and, rightly, illegal to do in humans.
404.134	And he obliged us.
406.266	At the Lurie Family Center
406.266	for Animal Imaging,
408.482	our colleague, Andrew Kung,
408.482	grew this cancer successfully in mice
412.121	without ever touching plastic.
413.835	And you can see this PET scan
413.835	of a mouse -- what we call a pet PET.
417.275	The cancer is growing
418.855	as this red, huge mass
418.855	in the hind limb of this animal.
422.181	And as we treat it with our compound,
424.428	this addiction to sugar,
426.06	this rapid growth, faded.
427.675	And on the animal on the right,
429.742	you see that the cancer was responding.
432.829	We've completed, now, clinical trials
435.06	in four mouse models of this disease.
437.06	And every time, we see the same thing.
438.933	The mice with this cancer
438.933	that get the drug live,
441.662	and the ones that don't rapidly perish.
446.06	So we started to wonder,
447.513	what would a drug company
447.513	do at this point?
449.641	Well, they probably
449.641	would keep this a secret
451.714	until they turn the prototype drug
453.623	into an active pharmaceutical substance.
456.323	So we did just the opposite.
458.144	We published a paper
458.144	that described this finding
461.003	at the earliest prototype stage.
463.773	We gave the world the chemical
463.773	identity of this molecule,
466.705	typically a secret in our discipline.
468.626	We told people exactly how to make it.
471.299	We gave them our email address,
472.991	suggesting that if they write us,
474.666	we'll send them a free molecule.
476.292	(Laughter)
477.404	We basically tried to create
477.404	the most competitive environment
480.325	for our lab as possible.
481.509	And this was, unfortunately, successful.
483.475	(Laughter)
484.523	Because now, we've shared this molecule,
486.552	just since December of last year,
488.979	with 40 laboratories in the United States
491.258	and 30 more in Europe --
493.06	many of them pharmaceutical companies,
494.933	seeking now to enter this space,
496.552	to target this rare cancer
496.552	that, thankfully right now,
500.456	is quite desirable
500.456	to study in that industry.
505.322	But the science that's coming back
505.322	from all of these laboratories
508.415	about the use of this molecule
510.273	has provided us insights
510.273	we might not have had on our own.
513.47	Leukemia cells treated with this compound
515.471	turn into normal white blood cells.
518.536	Mice with multiple myeloma,
520.341	an incurable malignancy
520.341	of the bone marrow,
523.4	respond dramatically
525.401	to the treatment with this drug.
527.576	You might know that fat has memory.
530.624	I'll nicely demonstrate that for you.
532.624	(Laughter)
533.679	In fact, this molecule
535.255	prevents this adipocyte,
535.255	this fat stem cell,
538.679	from remembering how to make fat,
541.572	such that mice on a high-fat diet,
543.964	like the folks
543.964	in my hometown of Chicago --
546.102	(Laughter)
547.134	fail to develop fatty liver,
549.166	which is a major medical problem.
552.18	What this research taught us --
553.776	not just my lab, but our institute,
556.06	and Harvard Medical School
556.06	more generally --
558.156	is that we have unique
558.156	resources in academia
560.441	for drug discovery;
561.799	that our center, which has tested
561.799	perhaps more cancer molecules
565.006	in a scientific way
566.187	than any other,
567.362	never made one of its own.
569.805	For all the reasons you see listed here,
571.996	we think there's a great
571.996	opportunity for academic centers
574.759	to participate in this earliest,
574.759	conceptually tricky
578.607	and creative discipline
580.561	of prototype drug discovery.
585.132	So what next?
586.609	We have this molecule,
586.609	but it's not a pill yet.
589.013	It's not orally bioavailable.
591.631	We need to fix it so we can
591.631	deliver it to our patients.
594.85	And everyone in the lab,
596.458	especially following the interaction
596.458	with these patients,
599.283	feels quite compelled
599.283	to deliver a drug substance
601.632	based on this molecule.
602.854	It's here where I'd say
604.289	that we could use your help
604.289	and your insights,
606.528	your collaborative participation.
608.741	Unlike a drug company,
608.741	we don't have a pipeline
612.446	that we can deposit these molecules into.
614.477	We don't have a team
614.477	of salespeople and marketeers
616.898	to tell us how to position
616.898	this drug against the other.
619.633	What we do have is the flexibility
619.633	of an academic center
622.325	to work with competent, motivated,
624.701	enthusiastic, hopefully well-funded people
627.63	to carry these molecules
627.63	forward into the clinic
629.947	while preserving our ability
629.947	to share the prototype drug worldwide.
634.734	This molecule will soon leave our benches
637.399	and go into a small start-up company
637.399	called Tensha Therapeutics.
640.473	And, really, this is the fourth
640.473	of these molecules
643.433	"to kind of ""graduate"""
643.433	from our little pipeline
645.704	of drug discovery,
647.182	two of which -- a topical drug
647.182	for lymphoma of the skin
652.457	and an oral substance for the treatment
652.457	of multiple myeloma --
655.592	will actually come to the bedside
655.592	for the first clinical trial
658.854	in July of this year -- for us,
658.854	a major and exciting milestone.
663.909	I want to leave you with just two ideas.
665.956	The first is: if anything is unique
665.956	about this research,
670.314	it's less the science than the strategy.
672.695	This, for us, was a social experiment --
675.141	"an experiment in ""What would happen"
675.141	if we were as open and honest
680.43	at the earliest phase
680.43	of discovery chemistry research
682.97	"as we could be?"""
684.441	This string of letters and numbers
686.806	and symbols and parentheses
688.845	that can be texted, I suppose,
690.488	or Twittered worldwide,
693.208	is the chemical identity
693.208	of our pro compound.
695.734	It's the information that we most need
695.734	from pharmaceutical companies,
699.84	the information on how these early
699.84	prototype drugs might work.
704.948	Yet this information is largely a secret.
707.742	And so we seek, really, to download
710.645	from the amazing successes
710.645	of the computer-science industry,
713.788	two principles -- that of open source
713.788	and that of crowdsourcing --
718.191	to quickly, responsibly accelerate
718.191	the delivery of targeted therapeutics
724.209	to patients with cancer.
726.377	Now, the business model
726.377	involves all of you.
729.52	This research is funded by the public.
731.845	It's funded by foundations.
733.247	And one thing I've learned in Boston
735.001	is that you people will do anything
735.001	for cancer, and I love that.
738.099	You bike across the state,
738.099	you walk up and down the river.
741.02	(Laughter)
743.15	I've never seen, really, anywhere,
745.5	this unique support for cancer research.
748.767	And so I want to thank you
750.548	for your participation, your collaboration
753.869	and most of all,
755.054	for your confidence in our ideas.
757.012	(Applause)
