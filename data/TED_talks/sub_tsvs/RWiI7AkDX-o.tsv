13.142	Ten years ago,
14.318	I had my first exhibition here.
16.638	I had no idea if it would work
16.638	or was at all possible,
20.678	but with a few small steps
20.678	and a very steep learning curve,
24.115	I made my first sculpture,
24.115	"called ""The Lost Correspondent."""
28.406	Teaming up with a marine biologist
28.406	and a local dive center,
31.847	I submerged the work
31.847	off the coast of Grenada,
34.54	in an area decimated by Hurricane Ivan.
37.957	And then this incredible thing happened.
40.554	It transformed.
43.675	One sculpture became two.
46.955	Two quickly became 26.
50.756	And before I knew it,
51.931	we had the world's first
51.931	underwater sculpture park.
56.73	In 2009, I moved to Mexico
56.73	and started by casting local fisherman.
62.95	This grew to a small community,
66.218	to almost an entire movement of people
66.218	in defense of the sea.
71.228	And then finally, to an underwater museum,
73.945	with over 500 living sculptures.
78.076	Gardening, it seems,
78.076	is not just for greenhouses.
83.375	We've since scaled up the designs:
86.041	"""Ocean Atlas,"" in the Bahamas,"
86.041	rising 16 feet up to the surface
90.175	and weighing over 40 tons,
93.825	to now currently in Lanzarote,
95.637	where I'm making
95.637	an underwater botanical garden,
98.796	the first of its kind
98.796	in the Atlantic Ocean.
102.834	Each project, we use materials
102.834	and designs that help encourage life;
107.108	a long-lasting pH-neutral cement
107.108	provides a stable and permanent platform.
113.398	It is textured to allow
113.398	coral polyps to attach.
117.262	We position them down current
117.262	from natural reefs
120.003	so that after spawning,
120.003	there's areas for them to settle.
125.937	The formations are all configured
125.937	so that they aggregate fish
128.859	on a really large scale.
132.918	Even this VW Beetle
132.918	has an internal living habitat
136.503	to encourage crustaceans
136.503	such as lobsters and sea urchins.
142.733	So why exhibit my work in the ocean?
145.497	Because honestly, it's really not easy.
148.059	When you're in the middle of the sea
148.059	under a hundred-foot crane,
151.288	trying to lower eight tons
151.288	down to the sea floor,
154.407	you start to wonder whether I shouldn't
154.407	have taken up watercolor painting instead.
158.36	(Laughter)
159.385	But in the end, the results
159.385	always blow my mind.
162.122	(Music)
184.791	The ocean is the most
184.791	incredible exhibition space
187.735	an artist could ever wish for.
189.43	You have amazing lighting effects
189.43	changing by the hour,
192.807	explosions of sand covering
192.807	the sculptures in a cloud of mystery,
197.148	a unique timeless quality
199.076	and the procession
199.076	of inquisitive visitors,
201.14	each lending their own
201.14	special touch to the site.
203.897	(Music)
231.288	But over the years,
232.463	I've realized that the greatest
232.463	thing about what we do,
235.846	the really humbling thing about the work,
238.369	is that as soon as we
238.369	submerge the sculptures,
240.606	they're not ours anymore,
242.156	because as soon as we sink them,
243.728	the sculptures, they belong to the sea.
246.013	As new reefs form, a new world
246.013	literally starts to evolve,
250.056	a world that continuously amazes me.
252.75	It's a bit of a cliché,
252.75	but nothing man-made
255.242	can ever match the imagination of nature.
258.591	Sponges look like veins across the faces.
262.478	Staghorn coral morphs the form.
266.567	Fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed.
271.557	Tunicates explode from the faces.
276.597	Sea urchins crawl across
276.597	the bodies feeding at night.
282.752	Coralline algae applies
282.752	a kind of purple paint.
287.671	The deepest red I've ever seen
287.671	in my life lives underwater.
294.235	Gorgonian fans oscillate with the waves.
299.002	Purple sponges breathe water like air.
303.221	And grey angelfish
303.221	glide silently overhead.
308.832	And the amazing response
308.832	we've had to these works
311.217	tells me that we've managed
311.217	to plug into something really primal,
315.394	because it seems that these images
315.394	translate across the world,
319.243	and that's made me focus
319.243	on my responsibility as an artist
323.108	and about what I'm trying to achieve.
325.917	I'm standing here today on this boat
325.917	in the middle of the ocean,
329.563	and this couldn't be a better place
331.31	to talk about the really,
331.31	really important effect of my work.
335.461	Because as we all know,
337.145	our reefs are dying,
337.145	and our oceans are in trouble.
341.16	So here's the thing:
342.454	the most used, searched and shared image
345.241	of all my work thus far is this.
349.256	And I think this is for a reason,
351.43	or at least I hope it is.
353.56	What I really hope is that people
353.56	are beginning to understand
356.724	that when we think of the environment
356.724	and the destruction of nature,
360.416	that we need to start thinking
360.416	about our oceans, too.
363.684	Since building these sites,
363.684	we've seen some phenomenal
366.239	and unexpected results.
368.26	Besides creating over 800 square meters
368.26	of new habitats and living reef,
373.433	visitors to the marine park in Cancun
373.433	now divide half their time
377.481	between the museum and the natural reefs,
380.037	providing significant rest
380.037	for natural, overstressed areas.
384.859	"Visitors to ""Ocean Atlas"""
384.859	in the Bahamas highlighted a leak
388.75	from a nearby oil refinery.
391.251	The subsequent international media
391.251	forced the local government
394.6	to pledge 10 million dollars
394.6	in coastal cleanups.
398.154	The sculpture park in Grenada
398.154	was instrumental
400.552	in the government designating a spot --
400.552	a marine-protected area.
404.843	Entrance fees to the park
404.843	now help fund park rangers
408.226	to manage tourism and fishing quotas.
411.293	The site was actually listed
411.293	"as a ""Wonder of the World"""
413.925	by National Geographic.
416.297	So why are we all here today in this room?
418.901	What do we all have in common?
421.56	I think we all share a fear
423.219	that we don't protect our oceans enough.
425.837	And one way of thinking about this
427.508	is that we don't regard
427.508	our oceans as sacred,
430.877	and we should.
432.572	When we see incredible places --
434.159	like the Himalayas
434.159	or the La Sagrada Família,
438.121	or the Mona Lisa, even --
439.806	when we see these incredible
439.806	places and things,
442.719	we understand their importance.
444.788	We call them sacred,
446.202	and we do our best
446.202	to cherish them, to protect them
449.883	and to keep them safe.
451.97	But in order to do that,
453.209	we are the ones that have
453.209	to assign that value;
456.563	otherwise, it will be desecrated
458.12	by someone who doesn't
458.12	understand that value.
461.549	So I want to finish up tonight
461.549	by talking about sacred things.
465.408	When we were naming the site in Cancun,
467.586	we named it a museum for a very
467.586	important and simple reason:
471.928	museums are places of preservation,
474.379	of conservation and of education.
477.524	They're places where we keep
477.524	objects of great value to us,
480.984	where we simply treasure them
480.984	for them being themselves.
484.966	If someone was to throw
484.966	an egg at the Sistine Chapel,
487.777	we'd all go crazy.
489.704	If someone wanted
489.704	to build a seven-star hotel
492.194	at the bottom of the Grand Canyon,
494.033	then we would laugh them out of Arizona.
496.494	Yet every day we dredge, pollute
496.494	and overfish our oceans.
500.927	And I think it's easier for us to do that,
503.357	because when we see the ocean,
505.477	we don't see the havoc we're wreaking.
507.429	Because for most people,
509.023	the ocean is like this.
510.98	And it's really hard
512.155	to think of something that's just
512.155	so plain and so enormous, as fragile.
517.597	It's simply too massive,
517.597	too vast, too endless.
521.387	And what do you see here?
522.634	I think most people actually
522.634	look past to the horizon.
525.713	So I think there's a real danger
527.426	that we never really see the sea,
530.337	and if we don't really see it,
531.87	if it doesn't have its own iconography,
534.293	if we miss its majesty,
536.329	then there's a big danger
536.329	that we take it for granted.
540.772	Cancun is famous for spring break,
544.113	tequila and foam parties.
546.396	And its waters are where frat boys
546.396	can ride around on Jet Skis
549.963	and banana boats.
551.59	But because of our work there,
551.59	there's now a little corner of Cancun
555.627	that is simply precious for being itself.
559.071	And we don't want to stop in Grenada,
561.726	in Cancun or the Bahamas.
564.496	Just last month, I installed
564.496	these Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
568.411	in the Thames River,
571.062	in central London, right in front
571.062	of the Houses of Parliament,
574.588	putting a stark message
574.588	about climate change
577.569	in front of the people that have
577.569	the power to help change things.
583.049	Because for me, this is just
583.049	the beginning of the mission.
586.111	We want to team up with other inventors,
588.641	creators, philanthropists,
588.641	educators, biologists,
592.586	to see better futures for our oceans.
594.984	And we want to see beyond sculpture,
597.556	beyond art, even.
599.995	Say you're a 14-year-old kid from the city,
602.437	and you've never seen the ocean.
604.476	And instead of getting taken
604.476	to the natural history museum
608.093	or an aquarium,
609.705	you get taken out to the ocean,
612.251	to an underwater Noah's Ark,
615.036	which you can access
615.036	through a dry-glass viewing tunnel,
619.03	where you can see
619.03	all the wildlife of the land
621.456	be colonized by the wildlife of the ocean.
624.29	Clearly, it would blow your mind.
627.29	So let's think big and let's think deep.
630.569	Who knows where our imagination
630.569	and willpower can lead us?
634.029	I hope that by bringing
634.029	our art into the ocean,
637.001	that not only do we take advantage
637.001	of amazing creativity
640.554	and visual impact of the setting,
642.713	but that we are also
642.713	giving something back,
645.183	and by encouraging
645.183	new environments to thrive,
648.565	and in some way opening up a new --
648.565	or maybe it's a really old way
653.658	of seeing the seas:
655.749	as delicate, precious places,
659.303	worthy of our protection.
661.896	Our oceans are sacred.
663.675	Thank you.
665.2	(Applause)
