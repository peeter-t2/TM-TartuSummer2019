12.864	We live in a very complex environment:
15.187	complexity and dynamism
17.091	and patterns of evidence
19.154	from satellite photographs, from videos.
22.039	You can even see it outside your window.
25.05	It's endlessly complex, but somehow familiar,
28.91	but the patterns kind of repeat,
30.87	but they never repeat exactly.
33.36	It's a huge challenge to understand.
37.487	The patterns that you see
39.619	are there at all of the different scales,
43.339	but you can't chop it into one little bit and say,
46.245	"""Oh, well let me just make a smaller climate."""
48.908	I can't use the normal products of reductionism
53.12	to get a smaller and smaller thing that I can study
55.842	"in a laboratory and say, ""Oh,"
58.15	"now that's something I now understand."""
60.546	It's the whole or it's nothing.
63.913	The different scales that give you
66.465	these kinds of patterns
68.587	range over an enormous range of magnitude,
72.044	roughly 14 orders of magnitude,
74.46	from the small microscopic particles
76.951	that seed clouds
79.327	to the size of the planet itself,
81.887	from 10 to the minus six
83.163	to 10 to the eight,
86.532	In time, from milliseconds to millennia,
89.943	again around 14 orders of magnitude.
92.998	What does that mean?
94.385	Okay, well if you think about how
96.324	you can calculate these things,
98.984	you can take what you can see,
100.944	okay, I'm going to chop it up
101.97	into lots of little boxes,
103.349	and that's the result of physics, right?
105.704	And if I think about a weather model,
107.429	that spans about five orders of magnitude,
109.923	from the planet to a few kilometers,
113.05	and the time scale
114.588	from a few minutes to 10 days, maybe a month.
119	We're interested in more than that.
120.395	We're interested in the climate.
121.7	That's years, that's millennia,
123.841	and we need to go to even smaller scales.
126.414	The stuff that we can't resolve,
128.015	the sub-scale processes,
129.98	we need to approximate in some way.
131.96	That is a huge challenge.
133.722	Climate models in the 1990s
135.91	took an even smaller chunk of that,
137.88	only about three orders of magnitude.
139.898	Climate models in the 2010s,
141.993	kind of what we're working with now,
143.767	four orders of magnitude.
146.707	We have 14 to go,
149.01	and we're increasing our capability
151.21	of simulating those at about
153.08	one extra order of magnitude every decade.
156.626	One extra order of magnitude in space
158.521	is 10,000 times more calculations.
161.77	And we keep adding more things,
164.15	more questions to these different models.
166.524	So what does a climate model look like?
169.257	This is an old climate model, admittedly,
171.598	a punch card, a single line of Fortran code.
175.678	We no longer use punch cards.
177.656	We do still use Fortran.
179.897	New-fangled ideas like C
181.854	really haven't had a big impact
185.089	on the climate modeling community.
187.456	But how do we go about doing it?
188.856	How do we go from that complexity that you saw
193.48	to a line of code?
196.01	We do it one piece at a time.
197.583	This is a picture of sea ice
199.461	taken flying over the Arctic.
201.559	We can look at all of the different equations
203.597	that go into making the ice grow
206.709	or melt or change shape.
208.823	We can look at the fluxes.
209.954	We can look at the rate at which
211.906	snow turns to ice, and we can code that.
214.751	We can encapsulate that in code.
217.08	These models are around
218.306	a million lines of code at this point,
220.389	and growing by tens of thousands of lines of code
223.859	every year.
225.05	So you can look at that piece,
226.703	but you can look at the other pieces too.
228.625	What happens when you have clouds?
230.558	What happens when clouds form,
232.717	when they dissipate, when they rain out?
234.599	That's another piece.
236.341	What happens when we have radiation
238.187	coming from the sun, going through the atmosphere,
240.721	being absorbed and reflected?
242.647	We can code each of those
242.647	very small pieces as well.
246.626	There are other pieces:
248.042	the winds changing the ocean currents.
251.502	We can talk about the role of vegetation
255.272	in transporting water from the soils
257.601	back into the atmosphere.
259.57	And each of these different elements
262.484	we can encapsulate and put into a system.
266.108	Each of those pieces ends up adding to the whole.
271.256	And you get something like this.
273.553	You get a beautiful representation
276.401	of what's going on in the climate system,
279.023	where each and every one of those
282.412	emergent patterns that you can see,
285.194	the swirls in the Southern Ocean,
287.197	the tropical cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico,
289.953	and there's two more that are going to pop up
291.594	in the Pacific at any point now,
293.948	those rivers of atmospheric water,
296.661	all of those are emergent properties
299.518	that come from the interactions
301.642	of all of those small-scale processes I mentioned.
305.137	There's no code that says,
307.042	"""Do a wiggle in the Southern Ocean."""
308.899	"There's no code that says, ""Have two"
311.567	"tropical cyclones that spin around each other."""
314.465	All of those things are emergent properties.
318.277	This is all very good. This is all great.
320.423	But what we really want to know
321.693	is what happens to these emergent properties
323.642	when we kick the system?
325.347	When something changes, what
325.347	happens to those properties?
328.88	And there's lots of different ways to kick the system.
331.869	There are wobbles in the Earth's orbit
333.902	over hundreds of thousands of years
335.781	that change the climate.
337.807	There are changes in the solar cycles,
339.943	every 11 years and longer, that change the climate.
343.048	Big volcanoes go off and change the climate.
346.622	Changes in biomass burning, in smoke,
349.86	in aerosol particles, all of those things
351.723	change the climate.
353.545	The ozone hole changed the climate.
357.604	Deforestation changes the climate
359.821	by changing the surface properties
361.747	and how water is evaporated
363.737	and moved around in the system.
366.203	Contrails change the climate
368.488	by creating clouds where there were none before,
371.355	and of course greenhouse gases change the system.
375.953	Each of these different kicks
378.974	provides us with a target
381.125	to evaluate whether we understand
383.96	something about this system.
386.121	So we can go to look at
388.513	what model skill is.
391.217	"Now I use the word ""skill"" advisedly:"
393.25	Models are not right or wrong; they're always wrong.
395.661	They're always approximations.
397.381	The question you have to ask
399.275	is whether a model tells you more information
402.354	than you would have had otherwise.
404.279	If it does, it's skillful.
407.66	This is the impact of the ozone hole
410.114	on sea level pressure, so
410.114	low pressure, high pressures,
412.974	around the southern oceans, around Antarctica.
415.569	This is observed data.
417.482	This is modeled data.
419.57	There's a good match
421.164	because we understand the physics
423.115	that controls the temperatures in the stratosphere
426.253	and what that does to the winds
427.999	around the southern oceans.
430.18	We can look at other examples.
431.699	The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991
434.555	put an enormous amount of aerosols, small particles,
437.354	into the stratosphere.
438.941	That changed the radiation
438.941	balance of the whole planet.
442.088	There was less energy coming
442.088	in than there was before,
444.87	so that cooled the planet,
446.528	and those red lines and those green lines,
448.547	those are the differences between what we expected
451.112	and what actually happened.
452.8	The models are skillful,
454.583	not just in the global mean,
456.276	but also in the regional patterns.
459.32	I could go through a dozen more examples:
462.16	the skill associated with solar cycles,
465.01	changing the ozone in the stratosphere;
467.08	the skill associated with orbital changes
469.427	over 6,000 years.
471.483	We can look at that too, and the models are skillful.
473.881	The models are skillful in response to the ice sheets
478.495	The models are skillful
480.166	when it comes to the 20th-century trends
483.07	over the decades.
484.585	Models are successful at modeling
486.867	lake outbursts into the North Atlantic
489.472	8,000 years ago.
491.237	And we can get a good match to the data.
495.463	Each of these different targets,
497.85	each of these different evaluations,
499.98	leads us to add more scope
502.371	to these models,
503.522	and leads us to more and more
506.266	complex situations that we can ask
510.254	more and more interesting questions,
512.823	like, how does dust from the Sahara,
515.533	that you can see in the orange,
517.267	interact with tropical cyclones in the Atlantic?
520.71	How do organic aerosols from biomass burning,
524.187	which you can see in the red dots,
526.91	intersect with clouds and rainfall patterns?
529.844	How does pollution, which you can see
531.631	in the white wisps of sulfate pollution in Europe,
535.53	how does that affect the
535.53	temperatures at the surface
538.865	and the sunlight that you get at the surface?
542.353	We can look at this across the world.
545.841	We can look at the pollution from China.
549.501	We can look at the impacts of storms
553.099	on sea salt particles in the atmosphere.
556.543	We can see the combination
559.104	of all of these different things
561.275	happening all at once,
562.743	and we can ask much more interesting questions.
565.15	How do air pollution and climate coexist?
569.774	Can we change things
571.283	that affect air pollution and
571.283	climate at the same time?
573.872	The answer is yes.
576.216	So this is a history of the 20th century.
579.26	The first one is the model.
581.503	The weather is a little bit different
582.91	to what actually happened.
584.199	The second one are the observations.
586.231	And we're going through the 1930s.
588.556	There's variability, there are things going on,
591.38	but it's all kind of in the noise.
593.562	As you get towards the 1970s,
596.424	things are going to start to change.
598.433	They're going to start to look more similar,
600.495	and by the time you get to the 2000s,
603.063	you're already seeing the
603.063	patterns of global warming,
605.705	both in the observations and in the model.
608.454	We know what happened over the 20th century.
610.581	Right? We know that it's gotten warmer.
612.341	We know where it's gotten warmer.
613.952	And if you ask the models why did that happen,
616.692	and you say, okay, well, yes,
618.817	basically it's because of the carbon dioxide
620.683	we put into the atmosphere.
622.662	We have a very good match
624.344	up until the present day.
626.971	But there's one key reason why we look at models,
630.391	and that's because of this phrase here.
632.612	Because if we had observations of the future,
635.107	we obviously would trust them more than models,
638.436	But unfortunately,
640.38	observations of the future
640.38	are not available at this time.
645.92	So when we go out into the
645.92	future, there's a difference.
648.625	The future is unknown, the future is uncertain,
651.187	and there are choices.
653.591	Here are the choices that we have.
655.424	We can do some work to mitigate
657.563	the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
660.358	That's the top one.
662.284	We can do more work
664.19	to really bring it down
666.366	so that by the end of the century,
668.584	it's not much more than there is now.
671.048	Or we can just leave it to fate
674.815	and continue on
676.308	with a business-as-usual type of attitude.
680.054	The differences between these choices
683.51	can't be answered by looking at models.
688.307	There's a great phrase
689.946	that Sherwood Rowland,
691.739	who won the Nobel Prize for the chemistry
695.603	that led to ozone depletion,
697.876	when he was accepting his Nobel Prize,
700.273	he asked this question:
701.652	"""What is the use of having developed a science"
703.963	well enough to make predictions if, in the end,
707.224	all we're willing to do is stand around
710.053	"and wait for them to come true?"""
712.76	The models are skillful,
715.497	but what we do with the
715.497	information from those models
718.815	is totally up to you.
720.986	Thank you.
722.924	(Applause)
