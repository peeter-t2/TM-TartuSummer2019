12.713	When we think of games,
12.713	there's all kinds of things.
15.183	Maybe you're ticked off, or maybe,
15.183	you're looking forward to a new game.
18.592	You've been up too late playing a game.
20.474	All these things happen to me.
21.961	But when we think about games,
23.42	a lot of times we think
23.42	about stuff like this:
25.614	first-person shooters, or the big,
25.614	what we would call AAA games,
28.669	or maybe you're a Facebook game player.
30.567	This is one my partner and I worked on.
32.466	Maybe you play Facebook games,
32.466	and that's what we're making right now.
35.793	This is a lighter form of game.
37.319	Maybe you think about
37.319	the tragically boring board games
39.946	that hold us hostage
39.946	in Thanksgiving situations.
42.212	This would be one of the tragically boring
42.212	board games that you can figure out.
45.975	Or maybe you're in your living room,
47.764	playing with the Wii with the kids,
49.645	and there's this whole range of games,
49.645	and that's very much what I think about.
53.403	I make my living from games,
53.403	I've been lucky enough to do this
56.368	since I was 15, which also qualifies
56.368	as I've never really had a real job.
59.829	But we think about games as fun,
59.829	and that's completely reasonable,
63.731	but let's just think about this.
65.369	So this one here,
65.369	this is the 1980 Olympics.
68.099	Now I don't know where you guys were,
69.948	but I was in my living room.
71.347	It was practically a religious event.
73.173	And this is when the Americans
73.173	beat the Russians,
75.784	and this was --
75.784	yes, it was technically a game.
78.047	Hockey is a game.
79.398	But really, was this a game?
81.168	I mean, people cried.
82.931	I've never seen my mother cry
82.931	like that at the end of Monopoly.
86.296	(Laughter)
87.462	And so this was an amazing experience.
89.838	Or, if anybody here is from Boston --
92.372	So when the Boston Red Sox
92.372	won the World Series
95.449	after I believe, 351 years --
98.38	(Laughter)
99.681	when they won the World Series,
99.681	it was amazing.
101.964	I happened to be living
101.964	in Springfield at the time,
104.386	and the best part of it was,
106.405	you would close the women's door
106.405	in the bathroom,
109.042	"and I remember seeing ""Go Sox,"""
109.042	and I thought, really?
111.957	Or the houses, you'd come out,
111.957	because every game,
115.03	well, I think almost every game,
115.03	went into overtime, right?
117.838	So we'd be outside, and all the other
117.838	lights are on in the whole block.
121.211	And kids -- the attendance
121.211	was down in school,
124.295	kids weren't going to school,
124.295	but it's OK, it's the Red Sox, right?
127.467	I mean, there's education,
127.467	and then there's the Red Sox,
130.138	and we know where they're stacked.
131.927	So this was an amazing experience,
133.772	and again, yes, it was a game,
133.772	but they didn't write newspaper articles,
137.285	"people didn't say, ""You know, really,"
137.285	"I can die now, because the Red Sox won."""
141.628	And many people did.
143.102	So games, it means something more to us.
146.071	It absolutely means something more.
147.964	So now, this is an abrupt transition here.
150.237	There was three years where
150.237	I actually did have a real job, sort of.
153.563	I was the head of a college
153.563	department teaching games,
156.143	so, again, it was sort of a real job,
157.942	and now I got to talk about making them
157.942	as opposed to making them.
161.603	Part of the job of it,
161.603	when you're a chair of a department,
164.899	is to eat, and I did that very well --
166.733	and so I'm out at a dinner
166.733	with this guy called Zig Jackson.
169.598	So this is Zig in this photograph,
169.598	this is also one of Zig's photographs.
173.176	He's a photographer.
174.361	And he goes all around the country
174.361	taking pictures of himself,
179.427	and you can see here he's got
179.427	Zig's Indian Reservation.
183.126	And this particular shot --
184.67	this is one of the more traditional shots.
187.819	This is a rain dancer.
189.506	And this is one of my favorite shots here.
191.628	So you can look at this, and maybe
191.628	you've even seen things like this.
194.907	This is an expression of culture, right?
196.855	And this is actually
196.855	from his Degradation series.
199.424	And what was most fascinating
199.424	to me about this series
201.927	is just, look at that little boy there,
201.927	can you imagine?
204.583	We can see that's
204.583	a traditional Native American.
206.858	Now I just want to change that guy's race.
208.92	Just imagine if that's a black guy.
210.841	"So, ""Honey, come here, let's get you"
210.841	"a picture with the black guy."" Right?"
214.345	Like, seriously, nobody would do this.
216.179	It baffles the mind.
217.588	And so Zig, being Indian,
217.588	likewise it baffles his mind.
220.493	His favorite photograph --
221.763	my favorite photograph of his,
221.763	which I don't have in here --
224.665	is Indian taking picture of white people
224.665	taking pictures of Indians.
227.928	(Laughter)
229.462	So I happen to be at dinner
229.462	with this photographer,
231.881	and he was talking
231.881	with another photographer
233.956	about a shooting that had occurred,
235.669	and it was on an Indian Reservation.
237.413	He'd taken his camera up there
237.413	to photograph it,
239.693	but when he got there,
239.693	he discovered he couldn't do it.
242.297	He just couldn't capture the picture.
244.103	And so they were talking back and forth
244.103	about this question.
247.022	Do you take the picture or not?
248.964	And that was fascinating
248.964	to me as a game designer,
251.369	because it never occurs to me,
252.824	should I make the game
252.824	about this difficult topic or not?
255.996	Because we just make things that are fun
257.934	or will make you feel fear,
257.934	that visceral excitement.
261.439	But every other medium does it.
263.42	So this is my kid.
264.613	This is Maezza, and when she was
264.613	seven years old,
267.31	she came home from school one day,
268.974	and like I do every single day,
268.974	"I asked her, ""What did you do today?"""
272.252	"So she said, ""We talked"
272.252	"about the Middle Passage."""
274.622	Now, this was a big moment.
274.622	Maezza's dad is black,
277	and I knew this day was coming.
279.623	I wasn't expecting it at seven,
279.623	I don't know why, but I wasn't.
282.763	Anyways, so I asked her,
282.763	"""How do you feel about that?"""
286.14	So she proceeded to tell me,
287.721	and so any of you who are parents
287.721	will recognize the bingo buzzwords here.
291.254	"""The ships start in England,"
291.254	they come down from England,
293.951	they go to Africa,
293.951	they go across the ocean --
296.165	that's the Middle Passage part --
297.834	they come to America, where
297.834	"the slaves are sold,"" she's telling me."
301.057	But Abraham Lincoln was elected president,
303.089	and then he passed
303.089	the Emancipation Proclamation,
305.404	and now they're free.
306.595	Pause for about 10 seconds.
307.923	"""Can I play a game, Mommy?"""
309.261	And I thought, that's it?
309.261	And so, you know,
311.373	this is the Middle Passage,
311.373	this is an incredibly significant event,
317.185	and she's treating it like, basically
317.185	some black people went on a cruise,
321.124	this is more or less how it sounds to her.
323.156	(Laughter)
324.337	And so, to me,
324.337	I wanted more value in this,
327.227	so when she asked
327.227	"if she could play a game, I said, ""Yes."""
330.431	(Laughter)
331.64	And so I happened to have
331.64	all of these little pieces.
334.145	I'm a game designer, so I have
334.145	this stuff sitting around my house.
337.268	"I said, ""Yeah, you can play a game,"""
337.268	and I give her a bunch of these,
340.545	and I tell her to paint them
340.545	in different families.
342.979	These are pictures of Maezza
342.979	when she was --
345.09	God, it still chokes me up seeing these.
347.056	So she's painting her little families.
348.905	So then I grab a bunch of them
348.905	and I put them on a boat.
351.565	This was the boat,
351.565	it was made quickly, obviously.
354.476	And so the basic gist of it is,
354.476	I grabbed a bunch of families,
357.441	"and she's like, ""Mommy,"
357.441	but you forgot the pink baby
359.901	and you forgot the blue daddy
361.343	"and you forgot all these other things."""
363.239	"And she says, ""They want to go."""
364.801	"And I said, ""Honey,"
364.801	no, they don't want to go.
367.041	This is the Middle Passage, Nobody wants
367.041	"to go on the Middle Passage."""
370.37	So she gave me a look that only a daughter
370.37	of a game designer would give a mother,
374.276	and as we're going across the ocean,
374.276	following these rules,
377.072	she realizes that she's rolling
377.072	pretty high,
379.155	and she says to me,
379.155	"""We're not going to make it."""
381.468	And she realizes,
381.468	we don't have enough food,
383.609	and so she asks what to do,
384.95	and I say -- remember, she's seven --
387.704	"""We can either put"
387.704	some people in the water
389.764	or we can hope that they don't get sick
391.659	"and we make it to the other side."""
393.305	Just the look on her face came over --
395.9	now mind you this is after a month of --
398.551	this is Black History Month, right?
400.254	After a month, she says to me,
400.254	"""Did this really happen?"""
404.2	"And I said, ""Yes."" And so she said --"
407.01	this is her brother and sister --
408.681	"""If I came out of the woods,"
408.681	"Avalon and Donovan might be gone."""
411.683	"""Yes."""
412.874	"""But I'd get to see them in America."""
414.706	"""No."""
415.881	"""But what if I saw them?"
415.881	"Couldn't we stay together?"""
418.434	"""So Daddy could be gone."""
419.709	"""Yes."""
420.891	She was fascinated by this,
420.891	and she started to cry,
423.352	I started to cry, her father started
423.352	to cry, and now we're all crying.
426.775	He didn't expect to come home from work
426.775	to the Middle Passage, but there it goes.
430.672	And so, we made this game, and she got it.
432.789	She got it because she spent time
432.789	with these people.
435.369	It wasn't abstract stuff
435.369	in a brochure or in a movie.
438.638	And so it was just an incredibly
438.638	powerful experience.
441.73	This is the game, which I've ended up
441.73	"calling ""The New World,"""
444.734	because I like the phrase.
446.04	I don't think the New World
446.04	felt too new worldly exciting
448.848	to the people who were
448.848	brought over on slave ships.
451.303	But when this happened,
451.303	I saw the whole planet; I was so excited.
454.413	I'd been making games for 20-some years,
456.823	and then I decided to do it again.
458.846	My history is Irish.
460.286	"So this is a game called ""Síochán Leat."""
460.286	"It's ""peace be with you."""
463.442	It's the entire history
463.442	of my family in a single game.
465.997	"I made another game called ""Train."""
468.52	I was making a series of six games
468.52	that covered difficult topics,
471.599	and if you're going to cover a difficult
471.599	topic, this is one you need to cover,
475.333	and I'll let you figure out
475.333	what that's about on your own.
478.085	And I also made a game
478.085	about the Trail of Tears.
480.962	This is a game
480.962	with 50,000 individual pieces.
483.44	I was crazy when I decided to start it,
483.44	but I'm in the middle of it now.
486.848	It's the same thing.
488.099	I'm hoping that I'll teach
488.099	culture through these games.
491.05	And the one I'm working
491.05	on right now, which is --
493.376	because I'm right in the middle of it,
495.226	and these for some reason
495.226	choke me up like crazy --
497.716	is a game called
497.716	"""Mexican Kitchen Workers."""
499.795	And originally, it was
499.795	a math problem, more or less.
502.264	Here's the economics
502.264	of illegal immigration.
504.355	And the more I learned
504.355	about Mexican culture --
506.58	my partner is Mexican —
506.58	the more I learned that,
508.874	you know, for all of us,
508.874	food is a basic need,
511.228	and it is obviously with Mexicans, too,
511.228	but it's much more than that.
514.558	It's an expression of love.
514.558	It's an expression of --
517.012	God, I'm totally choking up
517.012	way more than I thought.
519.486	I'll look away from the picture.
521.382	It's an expression of beauty,
521.382	it's how they say they love you.
524.702	It's how they say they care,
526.078	and you can't hear somebody
526.078	talk about their Mexican grandmother
529.13	"without saying ""food"""
529.13	in the first sentence.
531.987	And so to me, this beautiful culture,
534.167	this beautiful expression is something
534.167	that I want to capture through games.
538.511	And so games, for a change,
538.511	it changes how we see topics,
542.036	it changes our perceptions
542.036	about those people in topics,
545.572	and it changes ourselves.
547.318	We change as people through games,
549.531	because we're involved, and we're playing,
551.591	and we're learning as we do so.
553.104	Thank you.
