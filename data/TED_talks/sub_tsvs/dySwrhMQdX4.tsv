15.26	So historically there has
17.26	been a huge divide between what people
20.26	consider to be non-living systems on one
23.26	side, and living systems on the other side.
25.26	So we go from, say, this beautiful and
27.26	complex crystal as non-life, and this rather
30.26	beautiful and complex cat on the other side.
33.26	Over the last hundred and fifty years or so,
36.26	science has kind of blurred this distinction
38.26	between non-living and living systems, and
40.26	now we consider that there may be a kind
42.26	of continuum that exists between the two.
45.26	We'll just take one example here:
47.26	a virus is a natural system, right?
49.26	But it's very simple. It's very simplistic.
51.26	It doesn't really satisfy all the requirements,
53.26	it doesn't have all the characteristics
55.26	of living systems and is in fact a parasite
57.26	on other living systems in order to, say,
60.26	reproduce and evolve.
62.26	But what we're going to be talking about here
64.26	tonight are experiments done on this sort of
66.26	non-living end of this spectrum -- so actually
68.26	doing chemical experiments in the laboratory,
71.26	mixing together nonliving ingredients
73.26	to make new structures, and that these
75.26	new structures might have some of the
77.26	characteristics of living systems.
79.26	Really what I'm talking about here is
81.26	trying to create a kind of artificial life.
83.26	So what are these characteristics that I'm
85.26	talking about? These are them.
87.26	We consider first that life has a body.
89.26	Now this is necessary to distinguish the self
91.26	from the environment.
93.26	Life also has a metabolism. Now this is a
95.26	process by which life can convert resources
98.26	from the environment into building blocks
100.26	so it can maintain and build itself.
103.26	Life also has a kind of inheritable information.
105.26	Now we, as humans, we store our information
107.26	as DNA in our genomes and we pass this
110.26	information on to our offspring.
112.26	If we couple the first two -- the body and the metabolism --
114.26	we can come up with a system that could
116.26	perhaps move and replicate, and if we
118.26	coupled these now to inheritable information,
121.26	we can come up with a system that would be
123.26	more lifelike, and would perhaps evolve.
125.26	And so these are the things we will try to do
127.26	in the lab, make some experiments that have
129.26	one or more of these characteristics of life.
132.26	So how do we do this? Well, we use
134.26	a model system that we term a protocell.
136.26	You might think of this as kind of like a
138.26	primitive cell. It is a simple chemical
140.26	model of a living cell, and if you consider
143.26	for example a cell in your body may have
145.26	on the order of millions of different types
147.26	of molecules that need to come together,
149.26	play together in a complex network
151.26	to produce something that we call alive.
154.26	In the laboratory what we want to do
156.26	is much the same, but with on the order of
158.26	tens of different types of molecules --
160.26	so a drastic reduction in complexity, but still
162.26	trying to produce something that looks lifelike.
165.26	And so what we do is, we start simple
167.26	and we work our way up to living systems.
170.26	Consider for a moment this quote by
172.26	Leduc, a hundred years ago, considering a
174.26	kind of synthetic biology:
176.26	"""The synthesis of life, should it ever occur,"
178.26	will not be the sensational discovery which we
180.26	"usually associate with the idea."""
182.26	That's his first statement. So if we actually
184.26	create life in the laboratories, it's
186.26	probably not going to impact our lives at all.
188.26	"""If we accept the theory of evolution, then"
190.26	the first dawn of synthesis of life must consist
192.26	in the production of forms intermediate
194.26	between the inorganic and the organic
196.26	world, or between the non-living
198.26	and living world, forms which possess
200.26	"only some of the rudimentary attributes of life"""
202.26	-- so, the ones I just discussed --
204.26	"""to which other attributes will be slowly added"
206.26	in the course of development by the
208.26	"evolutionary actions of the environment."""
210.26	So we start simple, we make some structures
212.26	that may have some of these characteristics
214.26	of life, and then we try to develop that
216.26	to become more lifelike.
218.26	This is how we can start to make a protocell.
220.26	We use this idea called self-assembly.
222.26	What that means is, I can mix some
224.26	chemicals together in a test tube in my lab,
226.26	and these chemicals will start to self-associate
228.26	to form larger and larger structures.
230.26	So say on the order of tens of thousands,
232.26	hundreds of thousands of molecules will
234.26	come together to form a large structure
236.26	that didn't exist before.
238.26	And in this particular example,
240.26	what I took is some membrane molecules,
242.26	mixed those together in the right environment,
244.26	and within seconds it forms these rather
246.26	complex and beautiful structures here.
248.26	These membranes are also quite similar,
250.26	morphologically and functionally,
252.26	to the membranes in your body,
254.26	and we can use these, as they say,
256.26	to form the body of our protocell.
258.26	Likewise,
259.26	we can work with oil and water systems.
261.26	As you know, when you put oil and water together,
263.26	they don't mix, but through self-assembly
265.26	we can get a nice oil droplet to form,
267.26	and we can actually use this as a body for
269.26	our artificial organism or for our protocell,
271.26	as you will see later.
273.26	So that's just forming some body stuff, right?
275.26	Some architectures.
277.26	What about the other aspects of living systems?
279.26	So we came up with this protocell model here
281.26	that I'm showing.
283.26	We started with a natural occurring clay
285.26	called montmorillonite.
287.26	This is natural from the environment, this clay.
289.26	It forms a surface that is, say, chemically active.
291.26	It could run a metabolism on it.
293.26	Certain kind of molecules like to associate
295.26	with the clay. For example, in this case, RNA, shown in red
297.26	-- this is a relative of DNA,
299.26	it's an informational molecule --
301.26	it can come along and it starts to associate
303.26	with the surface of this clay.
305.26	This structure, then, can organize the
307.26	formation of a membrane boundary around
309.26	itself, so it can make a body of
311.26	liquid molecules around itself, and that's
313.26	shown in green here on this micrograph.
315.26	So just through self-assembly, mixing things
317.26	together in the lab, we can come up with, say,
320.26	a metabolic surface with some
322.26	informational molecules attached
324.26	inside of this membrane body, right?
326.26	So we're on a road towards living systems.
330.26	But if you saw this protocell, you would not
332.26	confuse this with something that was actually alive.
334.26	It's actually quite lifeless. Once it forms,
336.26	it doesn't really do anything.
338.26	So, something is missing.
340.26	Some things are missing.
342.26	So some things that are missing is,
344.26	for example, if you had a flow of energy
346.26	through a system, what we'd want
348.26	is a protocell that can harvest
350.26	some of that energy in order to maintain itself,
352.26	much like living systems do.
354.26	So we came up with a different protocell
356.26	model, and this is actually simpler than the previous one.
358.26	In this protocell model, it's just an oil droplet,
360.26	but a chemical metabolism inside
362.26	that allows this protocell to use energy
364.26	to do something, to actually become dynamic,
367.26	as we'll see here.
369.26	You add the droplet to the system.
371.26	It's a pool of water, and the protocell
373.26	starts moving itself around in the system.
375.26	Okay? Oil droplet forms
377.26	through self-assembly, has a chemical
379.26	metabolism inside so it can use energy,
381.26	and it uses that energy to move itself
383.26	around in its environment.
385.26	As we heard earlier, movement is very
387.26	important in these kinds of living systems.
389.26	It is moving around, exploring its environment,
391.26	and remodeling its environment, as you see,
393.26	by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell.
395.26	So it's acting, in a sense, like a living system
397.26	trying to preserve itself.
400.26	We take this same moving protocell here,
403.26	and we put it in another experiment,
405.26	get it moving. Then I'm going
407.26	to add some food to the system,
409.26	and you'll see that in blue here, right?
412.26	So I add some food source to the system.
414.26	The protocell moves. It encounters the food.
416.26	It reconfigures itself and actually then
418.26	is able to climb to the highest concentration
420.26	of food in that system and stop there.
422.26	Alright? So not only do we have this system
424.26	that has a body, it has a metabolism,
426.26	it can use energy, it moves around.
429.26	It can sense its local environment
431.26	and actually find resources
433.26	in the environment to sustain itself.
435.26	Now, this doesn't have a brain, it doesn't have
437.26	a neural system. This is just a sack of
439.26	chemicals that is able to have this interesting
441.26	and complex lifelike behavior.
443.26	If we count the number of chemicals
445.26	in that system, actually, including the water
447.26	that's in the dish, we have five chemicals
449.26	that can do this.
451.26	So then we put these protocells together in a
453.26	single experiment to see what they would do,
455.26	and depending on the conditions, we have
457.26	some protocells on the left that are
459.26	moving around and it likes to touch the other
461.26	structures in its environment.
463.26	On the other hand we have two moving
465.26	protocells that like to circle each other,
467.26	and they form a kind of a dance, a complex dance with each other.
469.26	Right? So not only do individual protocells
471.26	have behavior, what we've interpreted as
473.26	behavior in this system, but we also have
475.26	basically population-level behavior
478.26	similar to what organisms have.
481.26	So now that you're all experts on protocells,
484.26	we're going to play a game with these protocells.
486.26	We're going to make two different kinds.
488.26	Protocell A has a certain kind of chemistry
491.26	inside that, when activated, the protocell
493.26	starts to vibrate around, just dancing.
495.26	So remember, these are primitive things,
497.26	so dancing protocells, that's very
499.26	interesting to us. (Laughter)
501.26	The second protocell has a different
503.26	chemistry inside, and when activated,
505.26	the protocells all come together and they fuse
507.26	into one big one. Right?
509.26	And we just put these two together
511.26	in the same system.
513.26	So there's population A,
515.26	there's population B, and then
517.26	we activate the system,
519.26	and protocell Bs, they're the blue ones,
521.26	they all come together. They fuse together
523.26	to form one big blob, and the other protocell
525.26	just dances around. And this just happens
527.26	until all of the energy in the system is
529.26	basically used up, and then, game over.
532.26	So then I repeated this experiment
534.26	a bunch of times, and one time
536.26	something very interesting happened.
538.26	So, I added these protocells together
540.26	to the system, and protocell A and protocell B
542.26	fused together to form a hybrid protocell AB.
544.26	That didn't happen before. There it goes.
546.26	There's a protocell AB now in this system.
549.26	Protocell AB likes to dance around for a bit,
552.26	while protocell B does the fusing, okay?
555.26	But then something even more interesting happens.
558.26	Watch when these two large protocells,
560.26	the hybrid ones, fuse together.
562.26	Now we have a dancing protocell
565.26	and a self-replication event. Right. (Laughter)
569.26	Just with blobs of chemicals, again.
571.26	So the way this works is, you have
573.26	a simple system of five chemicals here,
575.26	a simple system here. When they hybridize,
577.26	you then form something that's different than
579.26	before, it's more complex than before,
581.26	and you get the emergence of another kind of
583.26	lifelike behavior which
585.26	in this case is replication.
587.26	So since we can make some interesting
589.26	protocells that we like, interesting colors and
591.26	interesting behaviors, and they're very easy
593.26	to make, and they have interesting lifelike
595.26	properties, perhaps these protocells have
598.26	something to tell us about the origin of life
600.26	on the Earth. Perhaps these represent an
602.26	easily accessible step, one of the first steps
604.26	by which life got started on the early Earth.
607.26	Certainly, there were molecules present on
609.26	the early Earth, but they wouldn't have been
611.26	these pure compounds that we worked with
613.26	in the lab and I showed in these experiments.
615.26	Rather, they'd be a real complex mixture of
617.26	all kinds of stuff, because
619.26	uncontrolled chemical reactions produce
621.26	a diverse mixture of organic compounds.
623.26	Think of it like a primordial ooze, okay?
626.26	And it's a pool that's too difficult to fully
628.26	characterize, even by modern methods, and
630.26	the product looks brown, like this tar here
632.26	on the left. A pure compound
634.26	is shown on the right, for contrast.
636.26	So this is similar to what happens when you
638.26	take pure sugar crystals in your kitchen,
640.26	you put them in a pan, and you apply energy.
642.26	You turn up the heat, you start making
644.26	or breaking chemical bonds in the sugar,
646.26	forming a brownish caramel, right?
648.26	If you let that go unregulated, you'll
650.26	continue to make and break chemical bonds,
652.26	forming an even more diverse mixture of
654.26	molecules that then forms this kind of black
656.26	tarry stuff in your pan, right, that's
658.26	difficult to wash out. So that's what
660.26	the origin of life would have looked like.
662.26	You needed to get life out of this junk that
664.26	is present on the early Earth,
666.26	four, 4.5 billion years ago.
668.26	So the challenge then is,
670.26	throw away all your pure chemicals in the lab,
672.26	and try to make some protocells with lifelike
674.26	properties from this kind of primordial ooze.
677.26	So we're able to then see the self-assembly
679.26	of these oil droplet bodies again
681.26	that we've seen previously,
683.26	and the black spots inside of there
685.26	represent this kind of black tar -- this diverse,
687.26	very complex, organic black tar.
689.26	And we put them into one of these
691.26	experiments, as you've seen earlier, and then
693.26	we watch lively movement that comes out.
695.26	They look really good, very nice movement,
697.26	and also they appear to have some kind of
699.26	behavior where they kind of circle
701.26	around each other and follow each other,
704.26	similar to what we've seen before -- but again,
706.26	working with just primordial conditions,
708.26	no pure chemicals.
710.26	These are also, these tar-fueled protocells,
712.26	are also able to locate resources
714.26	in their environment.
715.26	I'm going to add some resource from the left,
717.26	here, that defuses into the system,
719.26	and you can see, they really like that.
721.26	They become very energetic, and able
723.26	to find the resource in the environment,
725.26	similar to what we saw before.
727.26	But again, these are done in these primordial
729.26	conditions, really messy conditions,
731.26	not sort of sterile laboratory conditions.
733.26	These are very dirty little protocells,
735.26	as a matter of fact. (Laughter)
737.26	But they have lifelike properties, is the point.
740.26	So, doing these artificial life experiments
743.26	helps us define a potential path between
746.26	non-living and living systems.
749.26	And not only that, but it helps us
751.26	broaden our view of what life is
753.26	and what possible life there could be
755.26	out there -- life that could be very different
757.26	from life that we find here on Earth.
760.26	And that leads me to the next
762.26	"term, which is ""weird life."""
764.26	This is a term by Steve Benner.
767.26	This is used in reference to a report
769.26	in 2007 by the National Research Council
771.26	in the United States, wherein
773.26	they tried to understand how we can
775.26	look for life elsewhere in the universe, okay,
777.26	especially if that life is very different from life
779.26	on Earth. If we went to another planet and
782.26	we thought there might be life there,
784.26	how could we even recognize it as life?
786.26	Well, they came up with three very general
788.26	criteria. First is -- and they're listed here.
790.26	The first is, the system has to be in
792.26	non-equilibrium. That means the system
794.26	cannot be dead, in a matter of fact.
795.26	Basically what that means is, you have
797.26	an input of energy into the system that life
799.26	can use and exploit to maintain itself.
802.26	This is similar to having the Sun shining
804.26	on the Earth, driving photosynthesis,
806.26	driving the ecosystem.
808.26	Without the Sun, there's likely to be
810.26	no life on this planet.
812.26	Secondly, life needs to be in liquid form,
814.26	so that means even if we had some
816.26	interesting structures, interesting molecules
818.26	together but they were frozen solid,
820.26	then this is not a good place for life.
822.26	And thirdly, we need to be able to make
824.26	and break chemical bonds. And again
826.26	this is important because life transforms
828.26	resources from the environment into
830.26	building blocks so it can maintain itself.
832.26	Now today, I told you about very strange
834.26	and weird protocells -- some that contain clay,
836.26	some that have primordial ooze in them,
839.26	some that have basically oil
841.26	instead of water inside of them.
843.26	Most of these don't contain DNA,
845.26	but yet they have lifelike properties.
847.26	But these protocells satisfy
850.26	these general requirements of living systems.
853.26	So by making these chemical, artificial
855.26	life experiments, we hope not only
857.26	to understand something fundamental
859.26	about the origin of life and the existence
861.26	of life on this planet, but also
863.26	what possible life there could be
865.26	out there in the universe. Thank you.
868.26	(Applause)
