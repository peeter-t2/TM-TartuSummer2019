12.666	When I opened Mott Hall
12.666	Bridges Academy in 2010,
18.037	my goal was simple:
20.555	open a school to close a prison.
24.525	Now to some, this was an audacious goal,
27.534	because our school is located
27.534	in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn --
31.773	one of the most underserved
31.773	and violent neighborhoods
34.997	in all of New York City.
38.121	Like many urban schools
38.121	with high poverty rates,
42.427	we face numerous challenges,
45.173	like finding teachers who can empathize
47.623	with the complexities
47.623	of a disadvantaged community,
52.054	lack of funding for technology,
54.675	low parental involvement
57.433	and neighborhood gangs that recruit
57.433	children as early as fourth grade.
64.886	So here I was,
67.416	the founding principal of a middle school
67.416	that was a district public school,
73.728	and I only had 45 kids to start.
78.024	Thirty percent of them had special needs.
81.797	Eighty-six percent of them
81.797	were below grade level
84.862	in English and in math.
87.701	And 100 percent were living
87.701	below the poverty level.
93.258	If our children are not in our classrooms,
96.591	how will they learn?
98.731	And if they're not learning,
100.529	where would they end up?
103.402	It was evident when I would
103.402	ask my 13-year-old,
108.396	"""Young man,"
109.681	"where do you see yourself in five years?"""
113.663	And his response:
115.691	"""I don't know if I'm gonna"
115.691	"live that long."""
118.971	Or to have a young woman say to me
123.252	that she had a lifelong goal
123.252	of working in a fast-food restaurant.
128.8	To me, this was unacceptable.
131.862	It was also evident that they had no idea
135.123	that there was a landscape of opportunity
137.292	that existed beyond their neighborhood.
141.055	"We call our students ""scholars,"""
141.055	because they're lifelong learners.
146.597	And the skills that they learn today
148.401	will prepare them for college
148.401	and career readiness.
152.931	I chose the royal colors
152.931	of purple and black,
157.786	because I want them to be reminded
157.786	that they are descendants of greatness,
162.584	and that through education,
164.433	they are future engineers,
166.504	scientists,
167.69	entrepreneurs
169.077	and even leaders who can and will
169.077	take over this world.
174.544	To date,
175.846	we have had three graduating classes,
179.959	at a 98 --
181.369	(Applause)
190.341	At a 98-percent graduation rate.
194.12	This is nearly 200 children,
196.977	who are now going to some of the most
196.977	competitive high schools
200.257	in New York City.
201.755	(Applause)
209.675	It was a cold day in January
212.872	when my scholar, Vidal Chastanet,
212.872	met Brandon Stanton,
217.462	the founder of the popular blog
217.462	"""Humans of New York."""
222.102	Brandon shared the story
222.102	of a young man from Brownsville
226.019	who had witnessed violence firsthand,
229.977	by witnessing a man
229.977	being thrown off of a roof.
234.264	Yet he can still
234.264	be influenced by a principal
237.727	who had opened up a school
237.727	that believes in all children.
242.49	Vidal embodies the story of so many
242.49	of our underprivileged children
248.119	who are struggling to survive,
250.859	which is why we must
250.859	make education a priority.
255.992	Brandon's post created a global sensation
259.228	that touched the lives of millions.
262.855	This resulted in 1.4 million
262.855	dollars being raised
267.39	for our scholars to attend field trips
267.39	to colleges and universities,
274.001	Summer STEAM programs,
276.303	as well as college scholarships.
279.792	You need to understand
280.993	that when 200 young people
280.993	from Brownsville visited Harvard,
287.308	they now understood
289.161	that a college of their choice
289.161	was a real possibility.
294.457	And the impossibilities
294.457	that had been imposed upon them
298.431	by a disadvantaged community
300.585	were replaced by hope and purpose.
305.498	The revolution in education
305.498	is happening in our schools,
311.349	with adults who provide love,
314.727	structure,
315.927	support
317.113	and knowledge.
318.963	These are the things
318.963	that inspire children.
322.806	But it is not an easy task.
325.815	And there are high demands
328.709	within an education system
328.709	that is not perfect.
332.893	But I have a dynamic group of educators
336.756	who collaborate as a team to determine
336.756	what is the best curriculum.
341.553	They take time beyond their school day,
344.447	and come in on weekends
345.768	and even use their own money
345.768	to often provide resources
350.921	when we do not have it.
353.804	And as the principal,
355.676	I have to inspect what I expect.
359.308	So I show up in classes
361.836	and I conduct observations
361.836	to give feedback,
364.946	because I want my teachers
364.946	to be just as successful
368.385	as the name Mott Hall Bridges Academy.
371.93	And I give them access to me
371.93	every single day,
375.646	which is why they all have
375.646	my personal cell number,
378.534	including my scholars
378.534	and those who graduated --
381.616	which is probably why I get
381.616	phone calls and text messages
384.598	at three o'clock in the morning.
386.386	(Laughter)
388.174	But we are all connected to succeed,
390.794	and good leaders do this.
394.282	Tomorrow's future is sitting
394.282	in our classrooms.
398.304	And they are our responsibility.
401.526	That means everyone in here,
403.527	and those who are watching the screen.
406.649	We must believe in their brilliance,
410.234	and remind them by teaching them
412.867	that there indeed is power in education.
418.047	Thank you.
419.251	(Applause)
