12.1	Well, as many of you know,
13.659	the results of the recent
13.659	election were as follows:
16.98	Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate
19.62	won a landslide victory
21.54	with 52 percent of the overall vote.
24.34	Jill Stein, the Green candidate,
26.62	came a distant second, with 19 percent.
29.9	Donald J. Trump, the Republic candidate,
32.38	was hot on her heels with 14 percent,
35.5	and the remainder of the vote
35.5	were shared between abstainers
38.94	and Gary Johnson,
38.94	the Libertarian candidate.
45.08	(Laughter)
47.18	Now, what parallel universe
47.18	do you suppose I live in?
52.58	Well, I don't live in a parallel universe.
54.62	I live in the world,
54.62	and that is how the world voted.
58.98	So let me take you back
58.98	and explain what I mean by that.
62.62	In June this year,
63.86	I launched something
63.86	called the Global Vote.
66.62	And the Global Vote
66.62	does exactly what it says on the tin.
70.46	For the first time in history,
72.14	it lets anybody, anywhere in the world,
74.9	vote in the elections
74.9	of other people's countries.
78.86	Now, why would you do that?
80.94	What's the point?
82.58	Well, let me show you what it looks like.
84.94	You go to a website,
87.62	rather a beautiful website,
89.66	and then you select an election.
92.5	Here's a bunch that we've already covered.
95.78	We do about one a month, or thereabouts.
98.94	So you can see Bulgaria,
98.94	the United States of America,
101.78	Secretary-General of the United Nations,
104.3	the Brexit referendum at the end there.
107.26	You select the election
107.26	that you're interested in,
110.06	and you pick the candidates.
113.34	These are the candidates
113.34	from the recent presidential election
116.3	in the tiny island nation
116.3	of São Tomé and Príncipe,
121.82	off the coast of West Africa.
124.34	And then you can look at the brief summary
124.34	of each of those candidates
128.86	which I dearly hope is very neutral,
131.38	very informative and very succinct.
134.22	And when you've found
134.22	the one you like, you vote.
137.46	These were the candidates
139.02	in the recent Icelandic
139.02	presidential election,
141.9	and that's the way it goes.
144.74	So why on earth would you want to vote
144.74	in another country's election?
150.54	Well, the reason
150.54	that you wouldn't want to do it,
153.66	let me reassure you,
154.9	is in order to interfere in the democratic
154.9	processes of another country.
158.82	That's not the purpose at all.
160.5	In fact, you can't,
161.94	because usually what I do
161.94	is I release the results
164.42	after the electorate in each
164.42	individual country has already voted,
167.98	so there's no way that we could
167.98	interfere in that process.
170.82	But more importantly,
172.22	I'm not particularly interested
173.82	in the domestic issues
173.82	of individual countries.
176.1	That's not what we're voting on.
178.5	So what Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton
178.5	proposed to do for the Americans
182.46	is frankly none of our business.
184.5	That's something that only
184.5	the Americans can vote on.
187.54	No, in the global vote,
187.54	you're only considering one aspect of it,
191.1	which is what are those leaders
191.1	going to do for the rest of us?
195.3	And that's so very important
195.3	because we live,
197.98	as no doubt you're sick
197.98	of hearing people tell you,
200.42	in a globalized, hyperconnected,
200.42	massively interdependent world
205.7	where the political decisions
205.7	of people in other countries
208.46	can and will have an impact on our lives
210.7	no matter who we are,
210.7	no matter where we live.
214.26	Like the wings of the butterfly
216.14	beating on one side of the Pacific
218.46	that can apparently create
218.46	a hurricane on the other side,
222.02	so it is with the world
222.02	that we live in today
224.7	and the world of politics.
226.42	There is no longer a dividing line between
226.42	domestic and international affairs.
231.74	Any country, no matter how small,
234.18	even if it's São Tomé and Príncipe,
236.26	could produce the next Nelson Mandela
238.82	or the next Stalin.
241.46	They could pollute the atmosphere
241.46	and the oceans, which belong to all of us,
245.46	or they could be responsible
245.46	and they could help all of us.
249.42	And yet, the system is so strange
252.54	because the system hasn't caught up
252.54	with this globalized reality.
256.26	Only a small number of people
256.26	are allowed to vote for those leaders,
259.5	even though their impact is gigantic
261.58	and almost universal.
263.86	What number was it?
267.86	for the next president
267.86	of the United States,
270.14	and yet, as all of us knows,
270.14	in a few weeks time,
273.099	somebody is going to hand over
273.099	the nuclear launch codes
275.74	to Donald J. Trump.
277.54	Now, if that isn't having
277.54	a potential impact on all of us,
280.38	I don't know what is.
282.34	Similarly, the election
282.34	for the referendum on the Brexit vote,
289.02	a small number of millions
289.02	of British people voted on that,
292.46	but the outcome of the vote,
292.46	whichever way it went,
295.18	would have had a significant impact
296.9	on the lives of tens, hundreds of millions
296.9	of people around the world.
301.34	And yet, only a tiny number could vote.
303.78	What kind of democracy is that?
306.42	Huge decisions that affect all of us
308.18	being decided by relatively
308.18	very small numbers of people.
312.06	And I don't know about you,
313.42	but I don't think
313.42	that sounds very democratic.
316.18	So I'm trying to clear it up.
317.98	But as I say,
319.46	we don't ask about domestic questions.
321.34	In fact, I only ever ask two questions
321.34	of all of the candidates.
324.42	I send them the same
324.42	two questions every single time.
326.94	I say, one,
328.38	if you get elected, what are you
328.38	going to do for the rest of us,
331.54	for the remainder of the seven billion
331.54	who live on this planet?
334.98	Second question:
336.94	What is your vision
336.94	for your country's future in the world?
340.18	What role do you see it playing?
342.38	Every candidate,
342.38	I send them those questions.
345.18	They don't all answer. Don't get me wrong.
347.3	I reckon if you're standing
349.1	to become the next president
349.1	of the United States,
351.5	you're probably pretty tied up
351.5	most of the time,
353.9	so I'm not altogether surprised
353.9	that they don't all answer, but many do.
357.98	More every time.
359.5	And some of them do much more than answer.
361.58	Some of them answer in the most
361.58	enthusiastic and most exciting way
364.74	you could imagine.
365.98	I just want to say a word here
365.98	for Saviour Chishimba,
368.5	who was one of the candidates
369.94	in the recent Zambian
369.94	presidential election.
372.22	His answers to those two questions
372.22	were basically an 18-page dissertation
376.78	on his view of Zambia's
376.78	potential role in the world
380.46	and in the international community.
382.5	I posted it on the website
382.5	so anybody could read it.
385.74	Now, Saviour won the global vote,
388.78	but he didn't win the Zambian election.
391.14	So I found myself wondering,
392.54	what am I going to do
392.54	with this extraordinary group of people?
395.5	I've got some wonderful people here
395.5	who won the global vote.
398.38	We always get it wrong, by the way.
400.1	The one that we elect
401.34	is never the person who's elected
401.34	by the domestic electorate.
405.46	That may be partly because
405.46	we always seem to go for the woman.
409.22	But I think it may also be a sign
411.38	that the domestic electorate
411.38	is still thinking very nationally.
414.98	They're still thinking very inwardly.
417.14	They're still asking themselves:
417.14	What's in it for me? ...
420.66	instead of what
420.66	they should be asking today,
422.78	which is, what's in it for we?
425.82	But there you go.
427.06	So suggestions, please, not right now,
429.22	but send me an email if you've got an idea
431.244	about what we can do
431.244	with this amazing team of glorious losers.
434.52	(Laughter)
435.62	We've got Saviour Chishimba,
435.62	who I mentioned before.
438.1	We've got Halla Tómasdóttir,
439.5	who was the runner up
439.5	in the Icelandic presidential election.
442.42	Many of you may have seen
442.42	her amazing talk at TEDWomen
445.14	just a few weeks ago
446.38	where she spoke about the need
446.38	for more women to get into politics.
449.98	We've got Maria das Neves
449.98	from São Tomé and Príncipe.
453.34	We've got Hillary Clinton.
454.98	I don't know if she's available.
457.06	We've got Jill Stein.
459.3	And we covered also the election
462.18	for the next Secretary-General
462.18	of the United Nations.
465.285	We've got the ex-prime minister
465.285	of New Zealand,
467.5	who would be a wonderful
467.5	member of the team.
469.62	So I think maybe those people,
471.14	the glorious loser's club,
471.14	could travel around the world
473.82	wherever there's an election
475.22	and remind people
475.22	of the necessity in our modern age
478.62	of thinking a little bit outwards
480.26	and thinking of
480.26	the international consequences.
484.26	So what comes next for the global vote?
486.18	Well, obviously,
487.98	the Donald and Hillary show
487.98	is a bit of a difficult one to follow,
492.46	but there are some other
492.46	really important elections coming up.
495.42	In fact, they seem to be multiplying.
497.26	There's something going on,
497.26	I'm sure you've noticed, in the world.
500.42	And the next row of elections
500.42	are all critically important.
505.1	In just a few day's time
506.62	we've got the rerun
506.62	of the Austrian presidential election,
509.7	with the prospect of Norbert Hofer
511.5	becoming what is commonly described
513.5	as the first far-right head of state
513.5	in Europe since the Second World War.
518.1	Next year we've got Germany,
519.54	we've got France,
520.78	we've got presidential elections in Iran
522.94	and a dozen others.
524.739	It doesn't get less important.
526.9	It gets more and more important.
530.22	Clearly, the global vote
530.22	is not a stand-alone project.
534.02	It's not just there on its own.
536.58	It has some background.
537.86	It's part of a project
537.86	which I launched back in 2014,
541.9	which I call the Good Country.
544.26	The idea of the Good Country
544.26	is basically very simple.
547.66	It's my simple diagnosis
547.66	of what's wrong with the world
551.14	and how we can fix it.
553.62	What's wrong with the world
553.62	I've already hinted at.
556.06	Basically, we face
556.06	an enormous and growing number
558.82	of gigantic, existential
558.82	global challenges:
562.02	climate change, human rights abuses,
564.7	mass migration, terrorism,
564.7	economic chaos, weapons proliferation.
569.9	All of these problems
569.9	which threaten to wipe us out
573.1	are by their very nature
573.1	globalized problems.
575.26	No individual country has the capability
575.26	of tackling them on its own.
580.58	And so very obviously
582.34	we have to cooperate
582.34	and we have to collaborate as nations
585.98	if we're going to solve these problems.
588.38	It's so obvious, and yet we don't.
591.7	We don't do it nearly often enough.
594.46	Most of the time,
594.46	countries still persist in behaving
598.06	as if they were warring, selfish tribes
598.06	battling against each other,
602.74	much as they have done
602.74	since the nation-state was invented
605.5	hundreds of years ago.
607.1	And this has got to change.
609.26	This is not a change in political systems
609.26	or a change in ideology.
612.62	This is a change in culture.
614.58	We, all of us, have to understand
617.46	that thinking inwards is not the solution
617.46	to the world's problems.
621.5	We have to learn how to cooperate
621.5	and collaborate a great deal more
625.5	and compete just a tiny bit less.
629.02	Otherwise things
629.02	are going to carry on getting bad
631.42	and they're going to get much worse,
631.42	much sooner than we anticipate.
635.58	This change will only happen
637.5	if we ordinary people
639.26	tell our politicians
639.26	that things have changed.
642.1	We have to tell them
642.1	that the culture has changed.
644.66	We have to tell them
644.66	that they've got a new mandate.
647.26	The old mandate
647.26	was very simple and very single:
650.18	if you're in a position
650.18	of power or authority,
652.38	you're responsible for your own people
652.38	and your own tiny slice of territory,
656.02	and that's it.
657.26	And if in order to do
657.26	the best thing for your own people,
659.98	you screw over everybody else
659.98	on the planet, that's even better.
663.06	That's considered to be a bit macho.
664.82	Today, I think everybody
664.82	in a position of power and responsibility
668.22	has got a dual mandate,
669.86	which says if you're in a position
669.86	of power and responsibility,
672.86	you're responsible for your own people
674.74	and for every single man, woman,
674.74	child and animal on the planet.
679.1	You're responsible
679.1	for your own slice of territory
681.5	and for every single square mile
681.5	of the earth's surface
685.22	and the atmosphere above it.
686.62	And if you don't like that responsibility,
686.62	you should not be in power.
689.98	That for me is the rule of the modern age,
692.06	and that's the message that we've got
692.06	to get across to our politicians,
695.46	and show them that that's the way
695.46	things are done these days.
698.78	Otherwise, we're all screwed.
701.86	I don't have a problem, actually,
703.5	with Donald Trump's credo
703.5	"of ""America first."""
706.46	It seems to me that that's
706.46	a pretty banal statement
708.9	of what politicians have always done
708.9	and probably should always do.
712.1	Of course they're elected to represent
712.1	the interests of their own people.
716.3	But what I find so boring
716.3	and so old-fashioned
719.3	and so unimaginative
719.3	about his take on that
722.06	is that America first
722.06	means everyone else last,
726.1	that making America great again
726.1	means making everybody else small again,
730.3	and it's just not true.
732.46	In my job as a policy advisor
732.46	over the last 20 years or so,
735.38	I've seen so many hundreds
735.38	of examples of policies
739.02	that harmonize the international
739.02	and the domestic needs,
742.58	and they make better policy.
744.58	I'm not asking nations
744.58	to be altruistic or self-sacrificing.
748.18	That would be ridiculous.
749.54	No nation would ever do that.
751.66	I'm asking them to wake up and understand
751.66	that we need a new form of governance,
755.5	which is possible
757.46	and which harmonizes those two needs,
759.3	those good for our own people
759.3	and those good for everybody else.
763.34	Since the US election and since Brexit
765.58	it's become more and more obvious to me
767.98	that those old distinctions
767.98	of left wing and right wing
770.62	no longer make sense.
771.94	They really don't fit the pattern.
774.58	What does seem to matter today
776.9	is very simple,
778.54	whether your view of the world is
780.74	that you take comfort
780.74	from looking inwards and backwards,
784.46	or whether, like me, you find hope
784.46	in looking forwards and outwards.
790.06	That's the new politics.
791.58	That's the new division that is
791.58	splitting the world right down the middle.
796.62	Now, that may sound judgmental,
796.62	but it's not meant to be.
799.54	I don't at all misunderstand
801.5	why so many people find their comfort
801.5	in looking inwards and backwards.
806.38	When times are difficult,
806.38	when you're short of money,
808.9	when you're feeling
808.9	insecure and vulnerable,
811.02	it's almost a natural
811.02	human tendency to turn inwards,
813.54	to think of your own needs
815.58	and to discard everybody else's,
817.7	and perhaps to start to imagine
817.7	that the past was somehow better
821.46	than the present or the future
821.46	could ever be.
824.54	But I happen to believe
824.54	that that's a dead end.
827.02	History shows us that it's a dead end.
829.3	When people turn inwards
829.3	and turn backwards,
831.46	human progress becomes reversed
833.26	and things get worse for everybody
833.26	very quickly indeed.
838.54	If you're like me
839.98	and you believe in forwards and outwards,
842.7	and you believe that the best thing
842.7	about humanity is its diversity,
847.42	and the best thing about globalization
850.22	is the way that it stirs up
850.22	that diversity, that cultural mixture
854.54	to make something more creative,
854.54	more exciting, more productive
857.58	than there's ever been before
857.58	in human history,
860.54	then, my friends,
860.54	we've got a job on our hands,
863.98	because the inwards and backwards brigade
866.9	are uniting as never before,
869.46	and that creed of inwards and backwards,
871.42	that fear, that anxiety,
874.86	playing on the simplest instincts,
876.7	is sweeping across the world.
879.26	Those of us who believe,
881.22	as I believe, in forwards and outwards,
883.98	we have to get ourselves organized,
886.9	because time is running out
886.9	very, very quickly.
892.06	Thank you.
893.3	(Applause)
