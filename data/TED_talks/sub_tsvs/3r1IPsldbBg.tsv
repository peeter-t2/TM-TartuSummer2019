12.071	Have you ever asked yourselves why it is that
15.117	companies, the really cool companies,
17.197	the innovative ones, the creative,
18.709	new economy-type companies --
20.511	Apple, Google, Facebook --
23.885	are coming out of one particular country,
26.573	the United States of America?
28.304	"Usually when I say this, someone says, ""Spotify!"
30.262	"That's Europe."" But, yeah."
31.74	It has not had the impact that these other companies have had.
35.424	Now what I do is I'm an economist,
37.392	and I actually study the relationship
38.88	between innovation and economic growth
40.925	at the level of the company, the industry and the nation,
43.824	and I work with policymakers worldwide,
45.939	especially in the European Commission,
47.41	but recently also in interesting places like China,
50.721	and I can tell you that that question
52.596	is on the tip of all of their tongues:
55.196	Where are the European Googles?
57.415	What is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model,
61.16	which they understand is different
63.168	from this old economy growth model?
66.049	And what is interesting is that often,
68.728	even if we're in the 21st century,
70.307	we kind of come down in the end to these ideas
72.69	of market versus state.
74.663	It's talked about in these modern ways,
76.715	but the idea is that somehow, behind places like Silicon Valley,
80.478	the secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms,
84.264	the private initiative, whether this be about
87.536	a dynamic venture capital sector
89.75	that's actually able to provide that high-risk finance
92.096	to these innovative companies,
93.769	the gazelles as we often call them,
95.894	which traditional banks are scared of,
97.889	or different types of really successful
99.921	commercialization policies which actually allow these companies
102.927	to bring these great inventions, their products,
105.182	to the market and actually get over this
107.205	really scary Death Valley period
109.456	in which many companies instead fail.
112.022	But what really interests me, especially nowadays
114.798	and because of what's happening politically around the world,
117.759	is the language that's used, the narrative,
121.012	the discourse, the images, the actual words.
124.171	So we often are presented
126.476	with the kind of words like that the private sector
129.449	is also much more innovative because it's able to
131.719	think out of the box.
133.319	They are more dynamic.
135.572	Think of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech
138.326	to the 2005 graduating class at Stanford,
141.464	where he said to be innovative,
143.556	you've got to stay hungry, stay foolish.
146.326	Right? So these guys are kind of the hungry
147.861	and foolish and colorful guys, right?
150.012	And in places like Europe,
151.965	it might be more equitable,
153.55	we might even be a bit better dressed
155.112	and eat better than the U.S.,
157.378	but the problem is this damn public sector.
161.41	It's a bit too big, and it hasn't actually allowed
165.403	these things like dynamic venture capital
168.168	and commercialization to actually be able to really
170.902	be as fruitful as it could.
172.606	And even really respectable newspapers,
174.558	some that I'm actually subscribed to,
176.645	the words they use are, you know,
178.598	the state as this Leviathan. Right?
181.701	This monster with big tentacles.
183.834	They're very explicit in these editorials.
185.738	"They say, ""You know, the state, it's necessary"
188.267	to fix these little market failures
190.193	when you have public goods
191.952	or different types of negative externalities like pollution,
194.784	but you know what, what is the next big revolution
197.839	going to be after the Internet?
199.257	We all hope it might be something green,
201.191	"or all of this nanotech stuff, and in order for that stuff to happen,"" they say --"
205.4	this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution --
208.266	"they say, ""the state, just stick to the basics, right?"
210.921	Fund the infrastructure. Fund the schools.
213.409	Even fund the basic research, because this is
215.432	popularly recognized, in fact, as a big public good
218.101	which private companies don't want to invest in,
220.259	do that, but you know what?
221.82	"Leave the rest to the revolutionaries."""
224.6	Those colorful, out-of-the-box kind of thinkers.
227.897	They're often called garage tinkerers,
229.524	because some of them actually did some things in garages,
231.554	even though that's partly a myth.
234.129	And so what I want to do with you in, oh God,
236.423	only 10 minutes,
237.607	is to really think again this juxtaposition,
240.597	because it actually has massive, massive implications
243.456	beyond innovation policy,
244.95	which just happens to be the area
246.71	that I often talk with with policymakers.
249.59	It has huge implications, even with this whole notion
253.308	that we have on where, when and why
256.508	we should actually be cutting back on public spending
259.581	and different types of public services which,
261.626	of course, as we know, are increasingly being
263.383	outsourced because of this juxtaposition.
265.445	Right? I mean, the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools
268.908	is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened
272.77	by this heavy hand of the state curriculum, or something.
275.521	So these kind of words are constantly,
277.504	these juxtapositions come up everywhere,
279.368	not just with innovation policy.
282.216	And so to think again,
283.887	there's no reason that you should believe me,
286.293	so just think of some of the smartest
287.755	revolutionary things that you have in your pockets
290.026	and do not turn it on, but you might want to take it out, your iPhone.
292.968	Ask who actually funded the really cool,
295.614	revolutionary thinking-out-of-the-box
297.746	things in the iPhone.
299.533	What actually makes your phone
301.276	a smartphone, basically, instead of a stupid phone?
303.195	So the Internet, which you can surf the web
305.286	anywhere you are in the world;
306.994	GPS, where you can actually know where you are
309.578	anywhere in the world;
310.911	the touchscreen display, which makes it also
313.044	a really easy-to-use phone for anybody.
315.509	These are the very smart, revolutionary bits about the iPhone,
319.226	and they're all government-funded.
323.627	And the point is that the Internet
326.216	was funded by DARPA, U.S. Department of Defense.
328.46	GPS was funded by the military's Navstar program.
332.355	Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA.
335.113	The touchscreen display was funded
337.052	by two public grants by the CIA and the NSF
341.847	to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware.
346.302	"Now, you might be thinking, ""Well, she's just said"
348.52	"the word 'defense' and 'military' an awful lot,"""
350.855	but what's really interesting is that this is actually true
353.107	in sector after sector and department after department.
356.115	So the pharmaceutical industry, which I am personally
358.253	very interested in because I've actually had the fortune
360.182	to study it in quite some depth,
362.896	is wonderful to be asking this question
365.073	about the revolutionary versus non-revolutionary bits,
367.82	because each and every medicine can actually be
369.836	divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental.
373.807	So the new molecular entities with priority rating
376.58	are the revolutionary new drugs,
378.855	whereas the slight variations of existing drugs --
381.756	Viagra, different color, different dosage --
383.747	are the less revolutionary ones.
386.04	And it turns out that a full 75 percent
388.897	of the new molecular entities with priority rating
391.674	are actually funded in boring, Kafka-ian public sector labs.
396.785	This doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation.
399.468	They do. They spend on the marketing part.
401.519	They spend on the D part of R&amp;D.
403.667	They spend an awful lot on buying back their stock,
406.214	which is quite problematic.
408.115	In fact, companies like Pfizer and Amgen recently
410.332	have spent more money in buying back their shares
412.923	to boost their stock price than on R&amp;D,
414.959	but that's a whole different TED Talk which one day
417.287	I'd be fascinated to tell you about.
420.551	Now, what's interesting in all of this
422.554	is the state, in all these examples,
424.788	was doing so much more than just fixing market failures.
428.902	It was actually shaping and creating markets.
431.631	It was funding not only the basic research,
433.907	which again is a typical public good,
436.266	but even the applied research.
437.858	It was even, God forbid, being a venture capitalist.
441.534	So these SBIR and SDTR programs,
444.633	which give small companies early-stage finance
448.664	have not only been extremely important
450.879	compared to private venture capital,
452.976	but also have become increasingly important.
455.993	Why? Because, as many of us know,
458.869	V.C. is actually quite short-term.
460.736	They want their returns in three to five years.
462.525	Innovation takes a much longer time than that,
466.881	And so this whole notion -- I mean, this is the point, right?
469.268	Who's actually funding the hard stuff?
471.595	Of course, it's not just the state.
473.32	The private sector does a lot.
474.55	But the narrative that we've always been told
476.749	is the state is important for the basics,
479.632	but not really providing that sort of high-risk,
481.912	revolutionary thinking out of the box.
484.212	In all these sectors, from funding the Internet
486.544	to doing the spending, but also the envisioning,
489.449	the strategic vision, for these investments,
491.74	it was actually coming within the state.
493.328	The nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating
495.697	to study this, because the word itself, nanotechnology,
498.795	came from within government.
500.766	And so there's huge implications of this.
503.113	First of all, of course I'm not someone,
505.218	this old-fashioned person, market versus state.
507.22	What we all know in dynamic capitalism
509.745	is that what we actually need are public-private partnerships.
512.804	But the point is, by constantly depicting
515.543	the state part as necessary
517.668	but actually -- pffff -- a bit boring
520.549	and often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan,
523.598	I think we've actually really stunted the possibility
526.35	to build these public-private partnerships
527.922	in a really dynamic way.
529.468	"Even the words that we often use to justify the ""P"" part,"
532.662	the public part -- well, they're both P's --
534.89	with public-private partnerships
536.25	is in terms of de-risking.
538.305	What the public sector did in all these examples
540.766	I just gave you, and there's many more,
542.853	which myself and other colleagues have been looking at,
546.317	is doing much more than de-risking.
547.867	It's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on.
550.433	It's actually been the one thinking out of the box.
553.006	But also, I'm sure you all have had experience
555.717	with local, regional, national governments,
557.777	"and you're kind of like, ""You know what, that Kafka-ian bureaucrat, I've met him."""
560.924	That whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there.
564.368	Well, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
566.182	By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant,
568.348	boring, it's sometimes
570.675	that we actually create those organizations in that way.
572.887	So what we have to actually do is build
575.088	these entrepreneurial state organizations.
577.264	DARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri,
579.753	actually thought really hard about this,
581.338	how to welcome failure, because you will fail.
584.031	You will fail when you innovative.
585.956	One out of 10 experiments has any success.
589.828	And the V.C. guys know this,
591.566	and they're able to actually fund the other losses
593.438	from that one success.
595.292	And this brings me, actually, probably,
596.785	to the biggest implication,
599.38	and this has huge implications beyond innovation.
602.047	If the state is more than just a market fixer,
605.707	if it actually is a market shaper,
607.519	and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk,
610.487	what happened to the reward?
612.481	We all know, if you've ever taken a finance course,
614.855	the first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship,
618.261	and so some people are foolish enough
619.881	or probably smart enough if they have time to wait,
622.343	to actually invest in stocks, because they're higher risk
624.825	which over time will make a greater reward than bonds,
627.345	that whole risk-reward thing.
628.924	Well, where's the reward for the state
630.897	of having taken on these massive risks
633.353	and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet?
635.812	The Internet was crazy.
637.764	It really was. I mean, the probability of failure was massive.
640.916	You had to be completely nuts to do it,
643.526	and luckily, they were.
645.307	Now, we don't even get to this question about rewards
647.808	unless you actually depict the state as this risk-taker.
651.956	And the problem is that economists often think,
654.557	well, there is a reward back to the state. It's tax.
657.043	You know, the companies will pay tax,
658.592	the jobs they create will create growth
660.882	so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise
664.033	will come back to the state through the tax mechanism.
667.257	Well, unfortunately, that's not true.
669.247	Okay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad.
672.766	Globalization, and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic.
675.733	Let the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps.
677.94	I mean, one can take a position on that.
680.029	But also these companies
681.693	that have actually had this massive benefit from the state --
684.765	Apple's a great example.
686.626	They even got the first -- well, not the first,
688.675	but 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company,
693.243	through this SBIC program,
695.912	which predated the SBIR program,
697.96	as well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone.
701.278	And yet we know they legally,
703.768	as many other companies, pay very little tax back.
707.45	So what we really need to actually rethink
710.437	is should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism
714.696	that's much more direct than tax. Why not?
717.383	It could happen perhaps through equity.
719.953	This, by the way, in the countries
721.76	that are actually thinking about this strategically,
724.064	countries like Finland in Scandinavia,
726.195	but also in China and Brazil,
728.23	they're retaining equity in these investments.
730.56	Sitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money,
734.386	it's a public funding agency in Finland,
737.046	which then funded the next round of Nokias.
739.872	The Brazilian Development Bank,
741.881	which is providing huge amounts of funds today
744.676	to clean technology, they just announced
746.473	a $56 billion program for the future on this,
750.722	is retaining equity in these investments.
754.261	So to put it provocatively,
755.773	had the U.S. government thought about this,
758.712	and maybe just brought back
760.556	just something called an innovation fund,
762.981	you can bet that, you know, if even just .05 percent
766.113	of the profits from what the Internet produced
767.996	had come back to that innovation fund,
769.654	there would be so much more money
771.278	to spend today on green technology.
773.506	Instead, many of the state budgets
775	which in theory are trying to do that
777.598	are being constrained.
779.434	But perhaps even more important,
781.244	we heard before about the one percent,
783.111	the 99 percent.
784.686	If the state is thought about in this more strategic way,
788.431	as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism,
791.464	because that's what we're talking about, right?
793.285	Who are the different players in creating value
795.219	in the economy, and is the state's role,
797.514	has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player?
801.243	If we can actually have a broader theory
803.598	of value creation and allow us to actually admit
805.651	what the state has been doing and reap something back,
808.702	it might just be that in the next round,
811.521	and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution
814.087	will in fact be green,
815.728	that that period of growth
817.451	will not only be smart, innovation-led,
820.141	not only green, but also more inclusive,
823.327	so that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley
826.581	can actually also benefit from that growth,
829.321	because they have not.
830.92	Thank you.
832.173	(Applause)
