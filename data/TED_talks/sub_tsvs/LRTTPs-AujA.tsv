13.122	I am sorry I cannot show you my face,
17.119	because if I do, the bad guys will come for me.
22.205	My journey started 14 years ago.
26.293	I was a young reporter. I had just come out of college.
30.705	Then I got a scoop.
33.407	The scoop was quite a very simple story.
36.826	Police officers were taking bribes
39.43	from hawkers who were hawking on the streets.
42.966	As a young reporter, I thought that I should do it
45.768	in a different way, so that it has a maximum impact,
49.937	since everybody knew that it was happening,
51.825	and yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system.
55.394	So I decided to go there
57.629	and act as a seller.
61.594	As part of selling, I was able to document
64.847	the hard core evidence.
67.639	The impact was great.
70.161	It was fantastic.
72.722	This was what many call immersion journalism,
76.452	or undercover journalism.
79.021	I am an undercover journalist.
83.269	My journalism is hinged on three basic principles:
87.99	naming, shaming and jailing.
92.79	Journalism is about results.
94.66	It's about affecting your community or your society
98.399	in the most progressive way.
101.036	I have worked on this for over 14 years,
105.594	and I can tell you, the results are very good.
108.826	One story that comes to mind
111.057	in my undercover pieces
113.201	"is ""Spirit Child."""
115.412	It was about children who were born with deformities,
119.488	and their parents felt that once they were born
122.233	with those deformities,
123.922	they were not good enough to live in the society,
126.045	so they were given some concoction to take
129.153	and as a result they died.
131.73	So I built a prosthetic baby,
134.547	and I went into the village,
136.697	pretended as though this baby had been born
140.845	with a deformity, and here was the guys who do the killing.
144.932	They got themselves ready.
147.507	In their bids to kill, I got the police on standby,
151.093	and they came that fateful morning
153.633	to come and kill the child.
156.469	I recall how they were seriously boiling the concoction.
160.488	They put it on fire. It was boiling hot,
163.408	getting ready to give to the kids.
165.88	Whilst this was going on, the police I had alerted,
167.855	they were on standby,
170.528	and just as the concoction was ready,
173.764	and they were about to give it to the kids,
176.864	I phoned the police,
178.813	and fortunately they came and busted them.
182.982	As I speak now, they are before the courts.
185.934	Don't forget the key principles:
187.748	naming, shaming and jailing.
190.574	The court process is taking place,
192.587	and I'm very sure at the end of the day
194.67	we will find them, and we will put them
197.119	where they belong too.
199.862	Another key story that comes to mind,
202.55	which relates to this spirit child phenomenon,
206.897	"is ""The Spell of the Albinos."""
212.373	I'm sure most of you may have heard, in Tanzania,
215.864	children who are born with albinism
218.24	are sometimes considered as being unfit
222.293	to live in society.
224.992	Their bodies are chopped up with machetes
228.88	and are supposed to be used for some concoctions
232.208	or some potions for people to get money --
235.09	or so many, many stories people would tell about it.
238.885	It was time to go undercover again.
241.441	So I went undercover as a man who was interested
244.89	in this particular business, of course.
247.023	Again, a prosthetic arm was built.
249.593	For the first time, I filmed on hidden camera
253.172	the guys who do this, and they were ready to buy the arm
257.916	and they were ready to use it to prepare
260.066	those potions for people.
263.73	I am glad today the Tanzanian government has taken action,
267.306	but the key issue is that the Tanzanian government
270.448	could only take action because the evidence was available.
274.637	My journalism is about hard core evidence.
278.532	If I say you have stolen, I show you the evidence
280.931	that you have stolen.
282.434	I show you how you stole it
284.751	and when, or what you used
286.471	what you had stolen to do.
288.739	What is the essence of journalism if it doesn't benefit society?
293.309	My kind of journalism is a product
295.753	of my society.
299.17	I know that sometimes
302.348	people have their own criticisms
306.02	about undercover journalism.
309.508	(Video) Official: He brought out some money from his pockets
313.686	and put it on the table,
316.64	so that we should not be afraid.
319.955	He wants to bring the cocoa and send it to Cote d'Ivoire.
325.738	So with my hidden intention, I kept quiet.
329.426	I didn't utter a word.
331.816	But my colleagues didn't know.
333.674	So after collecting the money,
336.895	when he left, we were waiting for him to bring the goods.
340.023	Immediately after he left, I told my colleagues that
343.458	since I was the leader of the group,
344.975	I told my colleagues that if they come,
347.972	we will arrest them.
349.273	Second official: I don't even know the place called [unclear].
353.5	I've never stepped there before.
355.084	So I'm surprised.
356.051	You see a hand counting money just in front of me.
361.865	The next moment, you see the money in my hands,
365.209	counting, whereas I have not come into contact with anybody.
368.53	I have not done any business with anybody.
371.095	Reporter: When Metro News contacted investigative reporter
373.435	Anas Aremeyaw Anas for his reaction,
375.616	he just smiled and gave this video extract
378.49	he did not use in the documentary recently shown onscreen.
383.245	The officer who earlier denied involvement
385.594	pecks a calculator to compute the amount of money
388.656	they will charge on the cocoa to be smuggled.
393.248	Anas Aremeyaw Anas: This was another story on anticorruption.
395.858	And here was him, denying.
397.75	But you see, when you have the hard core evidence,
399.711	you are able to affect society.
403.071	Sometimes these are some of the headlines that come. (Music)

441.641	[Prez. Mills Storms Tema Harbour Over Anas Video]
445.406	"[""Late Prof. John Evans Atta Mills: Former president of Ghana""]"
449.121	John Evans Atta Mills: What Anas says
451.298	is not something which is unknown to many of us,
455.204	but please, those of you who are agents,
459.308	and who are leading the customs officers into temptation,
463.891	I'm telling you, Ghana is not going to say
468.244	any good things to you about this.
470.843	AAA: That was my president.
473.186	I thought that I couldn't come here
475.546	without giving you something special.
478.026	I have a piece, and I'm excited that
481.517	I'm sharing it for the first time with you here.
485.599	I have been undercover in the prisons.
489.705	I have been there for a long time.
493.891	And I can tell you, what I saw is not nice.
498.92	But again, I can only affect society
501.821	and affect government if I bring out the hard core evidence.
505.397	Many times, the prison authorities have denied
508.769	ever having issues of drug abuse,
511.317	issues of sodomy, so many issues they would deny
515.297	that it ever happens.
516.747	How can you obtain the hard core evidence?
520.111	"So I was in the prison. [""Nsawan Prison""]"
524.011	Now, what you are seeing is a pile of dead bodies.
528.197	Now, I happen to have followed one of my inmates,
531.267	one of my friends, from his sick bed till death,
535.823	and I can tell you it was not a nice thing at all.
539.464	There were issues of bad food being served
542.546	as I recall that some of the food I ate
547.456	is just not good for a human being.
551.717	Toilet facilities: very bad.
555.868	I mean, you had to queue to get proper toilets to attend --
560.292	and that's what I call proper,
563.008	when four of us are on a manhole.
566.417	It is something that if you narrate it to somebody,
570.157	the person wouldn't believe it.
571.991	The only way that you can let the person believe
574.197	is when you show hard core evidence.
576.309	Of course, drugs were abundant.
579.437	It was easier to get cannabis, heroin and cocaine,
582.182	faster even, in the prison than outside the prison.
585.885	Evil in the society is an extreme disease.
590.596	If you have extreme diseases,
592.518	you need to get extreme remedies.
595.445	My kind of journalism might not fit in other continents
598.179	or other countries,
599.861	but I can tell you, it works in my part of the continent
603.309	of Africa, because usually, when people talk
605.517	"about corruption, they ask, ""Where is the evidence?"
608.242	"Show me the evidence."""
609.423	"I say, ""This is the evidence."""
611.328	And that has aided in me putting a lot of people behind bars.
616.209	You see, we on the continent are able
619.729	to tell the story better because we face the conditions
622.313	and we see the conditions.
624.713	That is why I was particularly excited
626.5	"when we launched our ""Africa Investigates"" series"
628.88	where we investigated a lot of African countries.
632.081	"As a result of the success of the ""Africa Investigates"" series,"
635.732	we are moving on to World Investigates.
638.27	By the end of it, a lot more bad guys
640.913	on our continent will be put behind bars.
644.543	This will not stop.
646.17	I'm going to carry on with this kind of journalism,
649.097	because I know that when evil men destroy,
652.525	good men must build and bind.
654.513	Thank you very much.
655.786	(Applause)
665.323	Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.
667.021	I have some questions for you.
669.269	How did you end up in jail? This was just a few weeks ago, I believe, yeah?
673.499	AAA: Sure. You know, undercover is all about
675.714	setting the priorities right, so we got people
678.58	to take me to court.
680.418	So I went through the very legal process,
682.634	because at the end of the day, the prison authorities
684.858	want to check whether indeed you have been there or not,
687.474	and that's how I got in there.
689.488	CA: So someone sued you in court,
691.266	and they took you there, and you were in remand custody
694.073	for part of it, and you did that deliberately.
696.514	AAA: Yes, yes.
698.205	CA: Talk to me just about fear
701.368	and how you manage that,
703.177	because you're regularly putting your life at risk.
705.81	How do you do that?
707.373	AAA: You see, undercover is always a last resort.
710.563	Before we go undercover, we follow the rules.
712.777	And I'm only comfortable and I'm purged of fear
715.847	whenever I am sure that all the steps
718.327	have been taken. I don't do it alone. I have a backup team
721.535	who help ensure that the safety and all the systems
724.9	are put in place, but you've got to take
726.845	very intelligent decisions whenever they are happening.
729.596	If you don't, you will end up losing your life.
732.212	So yes, when the backup systems are put in place,
734.716	I'm okay, I go in. Risky, yes,
736.804	but it's a hazard of a profession.
739.46	I mean, everybody has their hazard.
741.013	And once you say that is yours,
742.946	you've got to take it, as and when it comes.
745.254	CA: Well, you're an amazing human and you've done amazing work
747.945	and you've taught us a story
749.215	like no story I think any of us have heard before.
752.462	And we're appreciative. We salute you. Thank you so much, Anas.
756.306	AAA: Thank you.
757.43	CA: Thank you. Stay safe. (Applause)
