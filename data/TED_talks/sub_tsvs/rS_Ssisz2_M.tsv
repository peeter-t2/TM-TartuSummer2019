12.537	I want to tell you
14.159	how 20,000 remarkable young people
18.85	from over 100 countries
20.706	ended up in Cuba
22.518	and are transforming health in their communities.
26.321	Ninety percent of them would never
28.401	have left home at all
29.973	if it weren't for a scholarship
29.973	to study medicine in Cuba
33.317	and a commitment to go back
35.128	to places like the ones they'd come from —
38.756	remote farmlands, mountains, ghettos —
42.203	to become doctors for people like themselves,
45.689	to walk the walk.
47.781	Havana's Latin American Medical School:
50.447	It's the largest medical school in the world,
53.372	graduating 23,000 young doctors
56.274	since its first class of 2005,
59.002	with nearly 10,000 more in the pipeline.
62.611	Its mission, to train physicians for the people
66.432	who need them the most:
68.483	the over one billion
70.419	who have never seen a doctor,
72.682	the people who live and die
76.515	under every poverty line ever invented.
80.009	Its students defy all norms.
82.259	They're the school's biggest risk
84.53	and also its best bet.
86.99	They're recruited from the poorest,
89.505	most broken places on our planet
92.076	by a school that believes they can become
94.35	not just the good
95.857	but the excellent physicians
97.792	their communities desperately need,
100.545	that they will practice where most doctors don't,
104.197	in places not only poor
106.623	but oftentimes dangerous,
109.176	carrying venom antidotes in their backpacks
112.202	or navigating neighborhoods
114.821	riddled by drugs, gangs and bullets,
118.142	their home ground.
120.842	The hope is that they will help
122.168	transform access to care,
124.768	the health picture in impoverished areas,
127.187	and even the way medicine itself
129.346	is learned and practiced,
131.889	and that they will become pioneers in our global reach
136.14	for universal health coverage,
138.66	surely a tall order.
141.378	"Two big storms and this notion of ""walk the walk"""
145.504	prompted creation of ELAM back in 1998.
149.588	The Hurricanes Georges and Mitch
152.591	had ripped through the Caribbean
154.143	and Central America,
156.348	leaving 30,000 dead
158.727	and two and a half million homeless.
161.61	Hundreds of Cuban doctors
161.61	volunteered for disaster response,
165.303	but when they got there,
167.148	they found a bigger disaster:
169.231	whole communities with no healthcare,
172.427	doors bolted shut on rural hospitals
174.751	for lack of staff,
176.63	and just too many babies dying
179.301	before their first birthday.
182.236	What would happen when these Cuban doctors left?
186.07	New doctors were needed to make care sustainable,
188.784	but where would they come from?
190.096	Where would they train?
192.901	In Havana, the campus of a former naval academy
197.344	was turned over to the Cuban Health Ministry
200.269	to become the Latin American Medical School,
203.62	ELAM.
205.633	Tuition, room and board, and a small stipend
208.107	were offered to hundreds of students
210.018	from the countries hardest hit by the storms.
213.051	As a journalist in Havana,
215.33	I watched the first 97 Nicaraguans arrive
218.047	in March 1999,
220.589	settling into dorms barely refurbished
223.305	and helping their professors not
223.305	only sweep out the classrooms
226.984	but move in the desks and the
226.984	chairs and the microscopes.
231.663	Over the next few years,
233.542	governments throughout the Americas
235.454	requested scholarships for their own students,
238.627	and the Congressional Black Caucus
240.505	asked for and received hundreds of scholarships
243.88	for young people from the USA.
247.12	Today, among the 23,000
250.832	are graduates from 83 countries
253.847	in the Americas, Africa and Asia,
256.851	and enrollment has grown to 123 nations.
262.454	More than half the students are young women.
264.658	They come from 100 ethnic groups,
266.05	speak 50 different languages.
268.075	WHO Director Margaret Chan said,
271.216	"""For once, if you are poor, female,"
275.254	or from an indigenous population,
277.516	you have a distinct advantage,
279.221	"an ethic that makes this medical school unique."""
283.95	Luther Castillo comes from San Pedro de Tocamacho
288.1	on the Atlantic coast of Honduras.
290.97	There's no running water,
292.882	no electricity there,
294.682	and to reach the village, you have to walk for hours
298.282	or take your chances in a pickup truck like I did
301.195	skirting the waves of the Atlantic.
304.49	Luther was one of 40 Tocamacho children
309.131	who started grammar school,
311.134	the sons and daughters of a black indigenous people
313.878	known as the Garífuna,
319.21	The nearest healthcare was fatal miles away.
324.363	Luther had to walk three hours every day
327.85	to middle school.
329.751	Only 17 made that trip.
331.832	Only five went on to high school,
333.936	and only one to university:
336.1	Luther, to ELAM,
338.121	among the first crop of Garífuna graduates.
342.13	Just two Garífuna doctors had preceded them
345	in all of Honduran history.
348.044	Now there are 69, thanks to ELAM.
353.945	Big problems need big solutions,
357.145	sparked by big ideas, imagination and audacity,
360.937	but also solutions that work.
363.94	ELAM's faculty had no handy evidence base
367.27	to guide them, so they learned the hard way,
370.79	by doing and correcting course as they went.
374.479	Even the brightest students
376.741	from these poor communities
378.654	weren't academically prepared
380.33	for six years of medical training,
383.023	so a bridging course was set up in sciences.
386.68	Then came language:
388.255	these were Mapuche, Quechuas, Guaraní, Garífuna,
391.416	indigenous peoples
393.193	who learned Spanish as a second language,
395.393	or Haitians who spoke Creole.
398.19	So Spanish became part
400.127	of the pre-pre-med curriculum.
404.285	Even so, in Cuba,
407.227	the music, the food, the smells,
410.461	just about everything was different,
413.15	so faculty became family, ELAM home.
418.155	Religions ranged from indigenous beliefs
420.968	to Yoruba, Muslim and Christian evangelical.
425	Embracing diversity became a way of life.
429.484	Why have so many countries
431.474	asked for these scholarships?
433.949	First, they just don't have enough doctors,
437.201	and where they do, their distribution
438.967	is skewed against the poor,
441.409	because our global health crisis
443.871	is fed by a crisis in human resources.
446.836	We are short four to seven million health workers
450.688	just to meet basic needs,
453.152	and the problem is everywhere.
455.01	Doctors are concentrated in the cities,
457.562	where only half the world's people live,
460.172	and within cities,
461.96	not in the shantytowns or South L.A.
466.139	Here in the United States,
467.905	where we have healthcare reform,
470.406	we don't have the professionals we need.
472.954	By 2020, we will be short
479.608	And we're also part of the problem.
481.765	The United States is the number one importer
484.232	of doctors from developing countries.
488.596	The second reasons students flock to Cuba
491.465	is the island's own health report card,
493.692	relying on strong primary care.
496.662	A commission from The Lancet
498.484	rates Cuba among the best performing
500.99	middle-income countries in health.
503.839	Save the Children ranks Cuba
505.785	the best country in Latin
505.785	America to become a mother.
510.421	Cuba has similar life expectancy
513.41	and lower infant mortality than the United States,
516.642	with fewer disparities,
518.823	while spending per person
520.623	one 20th of what we do on health
523.638	here in the USA.
525.787	Academically, ELAM is tough,
528.779	but 80 percent of its students graduate.
532.41	The subjects are familiar —
533.756	basic and clinical sciences —
536.23	but there are major differences.
538.656	First, training has moved out of the ivory tower
542.267	and into clinic classrooms and neighborhoods,
545.169	the kinds of places most of these grads will practice.
548.533	Sure, they have lectures and hospital rotations too,
552.627	but community-based learning starts on day one.
557.657	Second, students treat the whole patient,
561.423	mind and body,
563.337	in the context of their 
563.337	families, their communities
565.843	and their culture.
567.99	Third, they learn public health:
570.89	to assess their patients' drinking water, housing,
573.99	social and economic conditions.
577.286	Fourth, they are taught
579.817	that a good patient interview
582.584	and a thorough clinical exam
584.688	provide most of the clues for diagnosis,
587.523	saving costly technology for confirmation.
591.426	And finally, they're taught over and over again
594.976	the importance of prevention,
597.02	especially as chronic diseases
599.42	cripple health systems worldwide.
603.58	Such an in-service learning
606.77	also comes with a team approach,
609.37	as much how to work in teams
612.237	as how to lead them,
614.183	with a dose of humility.
616.31	Upon graduation, these doctors share
619.11	their knowledge with nurse's aids, midwives,
621.82	community health workers,
623.79	to help them become better at what they do,
626.176	not to replace them,
628.121	to work with shamans and traditional healers.
633.311	ELAM's graduates:
635.87	Are they proving this audacious experiment right?
640.527	Dozens of projects give us an inkling
642.822	of what they're capable of doing.
645.39	Take the Garífuna grads.
647.153	They not only went to work back home,
649.343	but they organized their communities to build
651.75	Honduras' first indigenous hospital.
655.151	With an architect's help,
657.3	residents literally raised it from the ground up.
661.777	The first patients walked through the doors
663.959	in December 2007,
666.299	and since then, the hospital has received
668.808	nearly one million patient visits.
671.958	And government is paying attention,
674.119	upholding the hospital as a model
676.64	of rural public health for Honduras.
681.819	ELAM's graduates are smart,
685.467	strong and also dedicated.
688.92	Haiti, January 2010.
693.274	The pain.
695.109	People buried under 30 million tons of rubble.
699.112	Overwhelming.
701.261	Three hundred forty Cuban doctors
703.139	were already on the ground long term.
705.58	More were on their way. Many more were needed.
707.983	At ELAM, students worked round the clock
711.227	to contact 2,000 graduates.
714.445	As a result, hundreds arrived in Haiti,
721.926	to St. Lucia, Bolivia, Chile and the USA.
726.414	They spoke easily to each other in Spanish
729.71	and listened to their patients in Creole
732.399	thanks to Haitian medical students
734.525	flown in from ELAM in Cuba.
736.752	Many stayed for months,
738.44	even through the cholera epidemic.
741.218	Hundreds of Haitian graduates
743.558	had to pick up the pieces,
746.28	overcome their own heartbreak,
748.294	and then pick up the burden
750.16	of building a new public health system for Haiti.
753.728	Today, with aid of organizations and governments
756.225	from Norway to Cuba to Brazil,
758.778	dozens of new health centers have been built,
761.004	staffed, and in 35 cases, headed
764.575	by ELAM graduates.
768.497	Yet the Haitian story
770.365	also illustrates some of the bigger problems
772.424	faced in many countries.
774.64	Take a look:
782.166	nearly half working in the public health sector
785.912	but one quarter unemployed,
787.983	and 110 had left Haiti altogether.
794.093	So in the best case scenarios,
796.861	these graduates are staffing
798.731	and thus strengthening public health systems,
801.98	where often they're the only doctors around.
805.159	In the worst cases, there are simply not enough jobs
807.95	in the public health sector,
809.592	where most poor people are treated,
812.158	not enough political will, not enough resources,
814.957	not enough anything —
817.163	just too many patients with no care.
820.616	The grads face pressure from their families too,
823.6	desperate to make ends meet,
825.903	so when there are no public sector jobs,
828.479	these new MDs decamp into private practice,
831.1	or go abroad to send money home.
835.115	Worst of all, in some countries,
838.3	medical societies influence accreditation bodies
841.236	not to honor the ELAM degree,
844.251	fearful these grads will take their jobs
846.568	or reduce their patient loads and income.
850.123	It's not a question of competencies.
853.104	Here in the USA, the California Medical Board
855.612	accredited the school after rigorous inspection,
859.212	and the new physicians are making good
861.26	on Cuba's big bet,
863.451	passing their boards and accepted
865.262	into highly respected residencies
867.647	from New York to Chicago to New Mexico.
871.738	Two hundred strong, they're coming
874.363	back to the United States energized,
876.748	and also dissatisfied.
879.335	As one grad put it,
880.966	"in Cuba, ""We are trained to provide quality care"
884.42	with minimal resources,
886.422	so when I see all the resources we have here,
888.998	and you tell me that's not possible,
891.16	I know it's not true.
893.33	"Not only have I seen it work, I've done the work."""
898.949	ELAM's graduates,
900.91	some from right here in D.C. and Baltimore,
904.427	have come from the poorest of the poor
907.595	to offer health, education
909.928	and a voice to their communities.
912.844	They've done the heavy lifting.
915.496	Now we need to do our part
917.51	to support the 23,000 and counting,
921.127	All of us —
922.481	foundations, residency directors, press,
926.115	entrepreneurs, policymakers, people —
929.299	need to step up.
931.452	We need to do much more globally
933.443	to give these new doctors the opportunity
936.382	to prove their mettle.
938.775	They need to be able
939.778	to take their countries' licensing exams.
942.982	They need jobs in the public health sector
945.93	or in nonprofit health centers
947.685	to put their training and commitment to work.
951.532	They need the chance to be
953.815	the doctors their patients need.
958.674	To move forward,
960.531	we may have to find our way back
963.523	to that pediatrician who would
965.706	knock on my family's door
967.393	on the South Side of Chicago when I was a kid,
970.579	who made house calls,
972.489	who was a public servant.
975.38	These aren't such new ideas
977.203	of what medicine should be.
979.565	What's new is the scaling up
982.29	and the faces of the doctors themselves:
985.673	an ELAM graduate is more likely to be a she
989.13	than a he;
991.06	In the Amazon, Peru or Guatemala,
993.987	an indigenous doctor;
996.338	in the USA, a doctor of color
999.352	who speaks fluent Spanish.
1001.748	She is well trained, can be counted on,
1005.427	and shares the face and culture of her patients,
1009.071	and she deserves our support surely,
1012.48	because whether by subway, mule, or canoe,
1016.946	she is teaching us to walk the walk.
1019.944	Thank you. (Applause)
