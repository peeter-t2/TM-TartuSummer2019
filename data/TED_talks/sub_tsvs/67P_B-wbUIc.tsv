12.16	Hello everyone.
13.16	And so the two of us are here to give you an example of creation.
17.16	And I'm going to be folding one of Robert Lang's models.
21.16	And this is the piece of paper it will be made from,
24.16	and you can see all of the folds that are needed for it.
27.16	And Rufus is going to be doing some improvisation
32.16	on his custom, five-string electric cello,
35.16	and it's very exciting to listen to him.
40.16	Are you ready to go? OK.
43.16	Just to make it a little bit more exciting.
45.16	All right. Take it away, Rufus.
47.16	(Music)
160.16	All right. There you go.
163.16	(Laughter)
164.16	(Applause)
