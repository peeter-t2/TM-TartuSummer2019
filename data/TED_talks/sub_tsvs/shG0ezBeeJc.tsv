12.776	What are you doing on this stage
17.21	in front of all these people?
20.352	(Laughter)
21.75	Run!
22.925	(Laughter)
23.952	Run now.
26.554	That's the voice of my anxiety talking.
30.359	Even when there's absolutely
30.359	nothing wrong,
33.319	I sometimes get
33.319	this overwhelming sense of doom,
37.302	like danger is lurking
37.302	just around the corner.
40.877	You see, a few years ago,
43.017	I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety
45.538	and depression --
47.109	two conditions that often go hand in hand.
49.893	Now, there was a time
49.893	I wouldn't have told anybody,
54.182	especially not in front of a big audience.
56.666	As a black woman,
58.217	I've had to develop
58.217	extraordinary resilience to succeed.
61.881	And like most people in my community,
63.884	I had the misconception that depression
63.884	was a sign of weakness,
67.716	a character flaw.
69.276	But I wasn't weak;
70.874	I was a high achiever.
72.745	I'd earned a Master's degree
72.745	in Media Studies
74.972	and had a string of high-profile jobs
74.972	in the film and television industries.
79.554	I'd even won two Emmy Awards
79.554	for my hard work.
83.256	Sure, I was totally spent,
86.296	I lacked interest in things
86.296	I used to enjoy,
88.99	barely ate,
90.312	struggled with insomnia
92.239	and felt isolated and depleted.
95.382	But depressed?
96.758	No, not me.
99.741	It took weeks before I could admit it,
101.971	but the doctor was right:
103.424	I was depressed.
105.231	Still, I didn't tell anybody
105.231	about my diagnosis.
109.342	I was too ashamed.
110.979	I didn't think I had the right
110.979	to be depressed.
114.238	I had a privileged life
115.892	with a loving family
115.892	and a successful career.
119.528	And when I thought about
119.528	the unspeakable horrors
122.144	that my ancestors
122.144	had been through in this country
124.656	so that I could have it better,
126.648	my shame grew even deeper.
128.8	I was standing on their shoulders.
130.917	How could I let them down?
133.202	I would hold my head up,
135.279	put a smile on my face
137.663	and never tell a soul.
142.286	On July 4, 2013,
146.299	my world came crashing in on me.
149.219	That was the day I got
149.219	a phone call from my mom
152.144	telling me that my 22-year-old nephew,
152.144	Paul, had ended his life,
156.358	after years of battling
156.358	depression and anxiety.
160.488	There are no words that can describe
160.488	the devastation I felt.
164.487	Paul and I were very close,
165.805	but I had no idea he was in so much pain.
168.516	Neither one of us had ever talked
168.516	to the other about our struggles.
172.098	The shame and stigma kept us both silent.
175.981	Now, my way of dealing with adversity
175.981	is to face it head on,
180.008	so I spent the next two years
180.008	researching depression and anxiety,
183.19	and what I found was mind-blowing.
186.584	The World Health Organization reports
188.582	that depression is the leading cause
188.582	of sickness and disability
193.83	in the world.
195.859	While the exact cause
195.859	of depression isn't clear,
198.874	research suggests
198.874	that most mental disorders develop,
201.996	at least in part,
203.747	because of a chemical
203.747	imbalance in the brain,
206.426	and/or an underlying
206.426	genetic predisposition.
210.861	So you can't just shake it off.
214.727	For black Americans,
216.482	stressors like racism
216.482	and socioeconomic disparities
220.562	put them at a 20 percent greater risk
220.562	of developing a mental disorder,
225.626	yet they seek mental health services
228.062	at about half the rate of white Americans.
231.364	One reason is the stigma,
234.238	with 63 percent of black Americans
234.238	mistaking depression for a weakness.
241.423	Sadly, the suicide rate
241.423	among black children
245.705	has doubled in the past 20 years.
249.663	Now, here's the good news:
252.423	seventy percent of people
252.423	struggling with depression will improve
256.729	with therapy, treatment and medication.
261.278	Armed with this information,
262.964	I made a decision:
264.695	I wasn't going to be silent anymore.
268.56	With my family's blessing,
270.387	I would share our story
272.304	in hopes of sparking
272.304	a national conversation.
275.96	A friend, Kelly Pierre-Louis, said,
278.755	"""Being strong is killing us."""
282.563	She's right.
284.006	We have got to retire
284.006	those tired, old narratives
288.052	of the strong black woman
289.631	and the super-masculine black man,
291.865	who, no matter how many times
291.865	they get knocked down,
294.809	just shake it off and soldier on.
297.59	Having feelings isn't a sign of weakness.
302.341	Feelings mean we're human.
304.67	And when we deny our humanity,
306.713	it leaves us feeling empty inside,
308.853	searching for ways to self-medicate
308.853	in order to fill the void.
312.405	My drug was high achievement.
316.191	These days, I share my story openly,
319.516	and I ask others to share theirs, too.
322.226	I believe that's what it takes
323.698	to help people who may
323.698	be suffering in silence
326.317	to know that they are not alone
328.55	and to know that with help,
330.259	they can heal.
331.624	Now, I still have my struggles,
333.813	particularly with the anxiety,
336.125	but I'm able to manage it
337.752	through daily mediation,
337.752	yoga and a relatively healthy diet.
342.65	(Laughter)
343.742	If I feel like things
343.742	are starting to spiral,
345.988	I make an appointment to see my therapist,
348.056	a dynamic black woman
348.056	named Dawn Armstrong,
351.143	who has a great sense of humor
353.14	and a familiarity that I find comforting.
356.946	I will always regret
359.21	that I couldn't be there for my nephew.
362.046	But my sincerest hope
364.515	is that I can inspire others
364.515	with the lesson that I've learned.
371.002	Life is beautiful.
374.466	Sometimes it's messy,
376.052	and it's always unpredictable.
378.854	But it will all be OK
380.081	when you have your support system
380.081	to help you through it.
383.333	I hope that if your burden gets too heavy,
385.778	you'll ask for a hand, too.
387.508	Thank you.
388.699	(Applause)
