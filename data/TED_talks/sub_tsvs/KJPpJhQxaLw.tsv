13.447	Do you ever think about how important
13.447	the oceans are in our daily lives?
19.65	The oceans cover two-thirds of our planet.
23.01	They provide half the oxygen we breathe.
25.856	They moderate our climate.
27.875	And they provide jobs
27.875	and medicine and food
32.001	including 20 percent of protein
32.001	to feed the entire world population.
38.151	People used to think
38.151	that the oceans were so vast
40.692	that they wouldn't be affected
40.692	by human activities.
44.025	Well today I'm going to tell you
44.025	about a serious reality
47.336	that is changing our oceans
47.336	called ocean acidification,
52.183	or the evil twin of climate change.
55.72	Did you know that the oceans have absorbed
61.167	that we have emitted to the atmosphere?
63.79	Now this is just another great service
63.79	provided by the oceans
67.453	since carbon dioxide
67.453	is one of the greenhouse gases
70.347	that's causing climate change.
73.13	But as we keep pumping
73.13	more and more and more
77.192	carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
79.85	more is dissolving into the oceans.
82.623	And this is what's changing
82.623	our ocean chemistry.
87.17	When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater,
89.583	it undergoes a number
89.583	of chemical reactions.
92.24	Now lucky for you,
93.43	I don't have time to get into
93.43	the details of the chemistry for today.
97.208	But I'll tell you as more
97.208	carbon dioxide enters the ocean,
100.557	the seawater pH goes down.
103.55	And this basically means that there
103.55	is an increase in ocean acidity.
108.168	And this whole process
108.168	is called ocean acidification.
112.724	And it's happening
112.724	alongside climate change.
116.176	Scientists have been monitoring
116.176	ocean acidification for over two decades.
120.818	This figure is an important
120.818	time series in Hawaii,
123.516	and the top line shows steadily increasing
123.516	concentrations of carbon dioxide,
128.436	or CO2 gas, in the atmosphere.
131.062	And this is directly as a result
131.062	of human activities.
135.16	The line underneath shows the increasing
135.16	concentrations of carbon dioxide
139.216	that is dissolved
139.216	in the surface of the ocean
142.398	which you can see is increasing
142.398	at the same rate
145.382	as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
145.382	since measurements began.
148.747	The line on the bottom shows
148.747	then shows the change in chemistry.
151.779	As more carbon dioxide
151.779	has entered the ocean,
154.63	the seawater pH has gone down,
157.371	which basically means there has been
157.371	an increase in ocean acidity.
163.005	Now in Ireland, scientists are also
163.005	monitoring ocean acidification --
167.1	scientists at the Marine
167.1	Institute and NUI Galway.
170.044	And we, too, are seeing
170.044	acidification at the same rate
174.218	as these main ocean time-series
174.218	sites around the world.
177.686	So it's happening right at our doorstep.
181.39	Now I'd like to give you an example
181.39	of just how we collect our data
184.573	to monitor a changing ocean.
187.009	Firstly we collect a lot of our samples
187.009	in the middle of winter.
190.089	So as you can imagine,
190.089	in the North Atlantic
192.253	we get hit with some seriously
192.253	stormy conditions --
194.969	so not for any of you
194.969	who get a little motion sickness,
197.627	but we are collecting
197.627	some very valuable data.
200.412	So we lower this instrument
200.412	over the side of the ship,
203.316	and there are sensors
203.316	that are mounted on the bottom
205.777	that can tell us information about
205.777	the surrounding water,
208.475	such as temperature
208.475	or dissolved oxygen.
211.27	And then we can collect our seawater
211.27	samples in these large bottles.
215.252	So we start at the bottom,
215.252	which can be over four kilometers deep
218.529	just off our continental shelf,
220.632	and we take samples at regular intervals
220.632	right up to the surface.
224.695	We take the seawater back on the deck,
227.091	and then we can either
227.091	analyze them on the ship
229.495	or back in the laboratory
229.495	for the different chemicals parameters.
232.987	But why should we care?
234.471	How is ocean acidification
234.471	going to affect all of us?
240.574	Well, here are the worrying facts.
244.597	There has already been an increase
244.597	in ocean acidity of 26 percent
250.424	since pre-industrial times,
250.424	which is directly due to human activities.
255.471	Unless we can start slowing down
255.471	our carbon dioxide emissions,
259.851	we're expecting an increase
259.851	in ocean acidity of 170 percent
266.208	by the end of this century.
269.533	I mean this is within
269.533	our children's lifetime.
273.325	This rate of acidification
273.325	is 10 times faster
278.968	than any acidification in our oceans
278.968	for over 55 million years.
285.88	So our marine life have never,
285.88	ever experienced
290.276	such a fast rate of change before.
293.371	So we literally could not know
293.371	how they're going to cope.
298.855	Now there was a natural acidification
298.855	event millions of years ago,
303.466	which was much slower
303.466	than what we're seeing today.
306.6	And this coincided with a mass extinction
306.6	of many marine species.
312.711	So is that what we're headed for?
315.09	Well, maybe.
316.851	Studies are showing
316.851	some species are actually doing quite well
320.368	but many are showing a negative response.
324.906	One of the big concerns is
324.906	as ocean acidity increases,
329.247	the concentration of carbonate
329.247	ions in seawater decrease.
334.31	Now these ions are basically
334.31	the building blocks
337.246	for many marine species
337.246	to make their shells,
340.579	for example crabs or mussels, oysters.
345.594	Another example are corals.
347.752	They also need these carbonate
347.752	ions in seawater
350.958	to make their coral structure
350.958	in order to build coral reefs.
356.187	As ocean acidity increases
358.599	and the concentration
358.599	of carbonate ions decrease,
362.282	these species first find it more difficult
362.282	to make their shells.
367.051	And at even even lower levels,
367.051	they can actually begin to dissolve.
372.035	This here is a pteropod,
372.035	it's called a sea butterfly.
375.336	And it's an important food source
375.336	in the ocean for many species,
378.772	from krill to salmon right up to whales.
383.208	The shell of the pteropod
383.208	was placed into seawater
386.747	at a pH that we're expecting
386.747	by the end of this century.
391.024	After only 45 days
391.024	at this very realistic pH,
396.86	you can see the shell
396.86	has almost completely dissolved.
401.375	So ocean acidification could affect
401.375	right up through the food chain --
405.644	and right onto our dinner plates.
408.294	I mean who here
408.294	likes shellfish? Or salmon?
412.502	Or many other fish species
414.155	whose food source
414.155	in the ocean could be affected?
417.946	These are cold-water corals.
419.932	And did you know we actually have
419.932	cold-water corals in Irish waters,
423.49	just off our continental shelf?
425.843	And they support rich biodiversity,
425.843	including some very important fisheries.
430.676	It's projected that
430.676	by the end of this century,
	in the entire ocean
440.397	will be surrounded by seawater
440.397	that is dissolving their coral structure.
448.67	The last example I have
448.67	are these healthy tropical corals.
452.892	They were placed in seawater at a pH
452.892	we're expecting by the year 2100.
459.304	After six months, the coral
459.304	has almost completely dissolved.
465.99	Now coral reefs support
	in the entire ocean.
475.69	All marine life.
477.888	So you can see: ocean
477.888	acidification is a global threat.
482.858	I have an eight-month-old baby boy.
485.8	Unless we start now to slow this down,
489.823	I dread to think what our oceans
489.823	will look like when he's a grown man.
495.52	We will see acidification.
497.65	We have already put too much
497.65	carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
502.85	But we can slow this down.
505.916	We can prevent the worst-case scenario.
510.57	The only way of doing that
512.833	is by reducing our
512.833	carbon dioxide emissions.
516.83	This is important for both you and I,
516.83	for industry, for governments.
521.42	We need to work together,
521.42	slow down global warming
525.32	slow down ocean acidification
527.9	and help to maintain a healthy ocean
527.9	and a healthy planet
532.659	for our generation
532.659	and for generations to come.
