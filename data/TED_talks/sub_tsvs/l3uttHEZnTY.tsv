146.779	Pep Rosenfeld: Folks,
146.779	you've just met Claron McFadden.
149.811	She is a world-class soprano singer
152.422	who studied in Rochester, New York.
154.938	Her celebrated operatic roles
154.938	are numerous and varied.
158.649	In August 2007, Claron was awarded
158.649	the Amsterdam Prize for the Arts,
164.244	winning praise for her brilliance,
166.083	her amazing and extensively
166.083	wide repertoire
169.513	and her vivid stage personality.
171.704	Please welcome Claron McFadden.
173.674	(Applause)
184.66	Claron McFadden: The human voice:
187.334	mysterious, spontaneous, primal.
193.053	For me, the human voice is the vessel
193.053	on which all emotions travel --
198.014	except, perhaps, jealousy.
201.84	And the breath,
203.339	the breath is the captain of that vessel.
207.591	A child is born,
210.558	takes its first breath --
212.863	(Inhales)
218.01	Whah!
220.531	And we behold the wondrous beauty
224.954	of vocal expression --
227.188	mysterious, spontaneous
230.899	and primal.
233.923	A few years ago, I did
233.923	a meditation retreat in Thailand.
237.089	I wanted a place
239.279	where I would have total silence
239.279	and total solitude.
243.988	I spent two weeks at this retreat
246.619	in my own little hut --
248.357	no music, no nothing -- sounds of nature,
252.214	trying to find the essence
252.214	of concentration,
255.777	being in the moment.
257.937	On my last day,
259.818	the woman who looked after the place,
262.675	she came and we spoke for a minute,
264.875	and then she said to me,
267.581	"""Would you sing something for me?"""
269.915	And I thought, but this is a place
269.915	of total quiet and silence.
273.216	I can't make noise.
275.81	"She said, ""Please, sing for me."""
279.553	So I closed my eyes,
282.18	I took breath
285.1	and the first thing that came up and out
288.465	"was ""Summertime,"""
291.037	Porgy and Bess.
292.259	(Singing) Summertime
292.259	and the livin' is easy.
297.632	Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high.
300.798	Oh, your daddy's rich
300.798	and your ma is good-lookin'.
304.807	So hush little baby,
306.421	don't you cry.
310.103	And I opened my eyes,
312.473	and I saw that she had her eyes closed.
316.001	And after a moment, she opened her eyes
318.128	and she looked at me and she said,
321.025	"""It's like meditation."""
323.765	And in that moment I understood
326.011	that everything I had gone
326.011	to Thailand to look for,
329.447	to search for,
331.057	I had it already in my singing --
334.866	the calm, but alertness,
338.66	the focus, but awareness,
341.804	and being totally in the moment.
346.295	When you're totally in the moment --
348.065	when I'm totally in the moment,
349.588	the vessel of expression is open.
351.817	The emotions can flow from me
354.413	to you
355.61	and back.
357.817	It's an extremely profound experience.
362.047	There's a piece by a composer,
364.421	an American composer called John Cage.
367.043	"It's called ""Aria."""
368.647	It was written for an amazing singer
368.647	called Cathy Berberian.
373.752	And the thing about this piece
373.752	that's so special --
376.942	if you see it behind me --
379.267	it's not notated in any way.
382.669	No notes, no flats, no sharps.
386.058	But it's a kind of structure.
388.431	And the singer, within this structure,
390.915	has total freedom
390.915	to be creative, spontaneous.
395.538	For example,
397.832	there are different colors
399.403	and each color gets
399.403	a different type of singing --
403.379	pop, country and western, opera, jazz --
407.292	and you just have
407.292	to be consistent with that color.
411.61	You see there are different lines.
413.998	You choose in your own tempo
413.998	in your own way
416.229	to follow the line,
417.506	but you must respect it,
419.726	more or less.
421.391	And these little dots,
423.906	these represent a sort of sound
428.459	that's not a vocal, not a lyrical way
431.26	of expressing the voice.
433.491	Using the body -- it could be sneezing,
435.576	it could be coughing, animals --
437.179	(Audience member coughs)
438.798	Exactly. (Laughter)
440.114	Clapping, whatever.
443.138	And there's different text.
445.129	There's Armenian, Russian,
445.129	French, English, Italian.
449.459	So within this structure, one is free.
452.945	To me, this piece is an ode to the voice,
456.992	because it's mysterious, as we can see.
461.413	It's quite spontaneous.
465.811	And it's primal.
467.765	So I would like to share
467.765	this piece with you,
469.979	"It's ""Aria,"" of John Cage."
