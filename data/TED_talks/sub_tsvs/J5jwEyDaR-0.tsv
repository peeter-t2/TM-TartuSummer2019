18.042	This is a kindergarten
18.042	we designed in 2007.
22.111	We made this kindergarten 
22.111	to be a circle.
26.036	It's a kind of endless circulation
26.036	on top of the roof.
29.179	If you are a parent,
31.699	you know that kids love
31.699	to keep making circles.
36.793	This is how the rooftop looks.
39.6	And why did we design this?
41.858	The principal of this kindergarten said,
44.675	"""No, I don't want a handrail."""
47.254	"I said, ""It's impossible."""
49.483	"But he insisted: ""How about having a net"
49.483	sticking out from the edge of the roof?
55.777	So that it can catch
55.777	"the children falling off?"""
57.986	(Laughter)
59.433	"I said, ""It's impossible."""
61.97	And of course,
61.97	the government official said,
64.889	"""Of course you have to have a handrail."""
70.324	But we could keep 
70.324	that idea around the trees.
73.843	There are three trees popping through.
77.12	And we were allowed to call 
77.12	this rope as a handrail.
82.745	But of course, rope has nothing
82.745	to do with them.
86.017	They fall into the net.
89.304	And you get more,
92.355	and more,
95.292	more.
96.502	(Laughter)
97.653	Sometimes 40 children 
97.653	are around a tree.
103.733	The boy on the branch,
104.981	he loves the tree
104.981	so he is eating the tree.
107.464	(Laughter)
110.984	And at the time of an event,
112.785	they sit on the edge.
116.191	It looks so nice from underneath.
118.563	Monkeys in the zoo.
120.652	(Laughter)
124.552	Feeding time.
126.318	(Laughter) 
126.318	(Applause)
132.784	And we made the roof as low as possible,
135.313	because we wanted to see
135.313	children on top of the roof,
139.757	not only underneath the roof.
142.438	And if the roof is too high,
142.438	you see only the ceiling.
147.699	And the leg washing place --
147.699	there are many kinds of water taps.
152.656	You see with the flexible tubes,
154.434	you want to spray water
154.434	to your friends,
157.329	and the shower,
159.044	and the one in front is quite normal.
161.541	But if you look at this,
163.087	the boy is not washing his boots,
164.917	he's putting water into his boots.
166.591	(Laughter)
173.423	This kindergarten is completely
173.423	open, most of the year.
179.699	And there is no boundary
179.699	between inside and outside.
183.339	So it means basically
183.339	this architecture is a roof.
187.978	And also there is no boundary
187.978	between classrooms.
191.267	So there is no acoustic barrier at all.
195.59	When you put many children in a quiet box,
201.415	some of them get really nervous.
204.733	But in this kindergarten,
206.985	there is no reason they get nervous.
210.415	Because there is no boundary.
213.225	And the principal says
215.422	if the boy in the corner
215.422	doesn't want to stay in the room,
219.425	we let him go.
221.12	He will come back eventually,
221.12	because it's a circle, it comes back.
224.279	(Laughter)
228.561	But the point is,
228.561	in that kind of occasion,
231.556	usually children try to hide somewhere.
234.407	But here, just they leave and come back.
238.986	It's a natural process.
240.836	And secondly, we consider
240.836	noise very important.
247.711	You know that children
247.711	sleep better in noise.
254.142	They don't sleep in a quiet space.
257.986	And in this kindergarten,
260.236	these children show
260.236	amazing concentration in class.
267.193	And you know, our kind grew up
267.193	in the jungle with noise.
273.66	They need noise.
275.663	And you know, you can talk
275.663	to your friends in a noisy bar.
279.967	You are not supposed to be in silence.
283.928	And you know, these days
286.095	we are trying to make
286.095	everything under control.
292.219	You know, it's completely open.
294.021	And you should know that
297.033	we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter.
302.818	In summer you go swimming.
305.922	The sand is 50 degrees.
308.636	And also, you should know
308.636	that you are waterproof.
312.029	You never melt in rain.
315.181	So, children are supposed to be outside.
319.05	So that is how we should treat them.
322.251	This is how they divide classrooms.
324.923	They are supposed to help teachers.
327.426	They don't.
329.731	(Laughter)
335.226	I didn't put him in.
339.522	A classroom.
342.196	And a washbasin.
344.655	They talk to each other around the well.
349.082	And there are always 
349.082	some trees in the classroom.
355.969	A monkey trying to fish
355.969	another monkey from above.
359.377	(Laughter)
361.225	Monkeys.
362.829	(Laughter)
364.283	And each classroom has
364.283	at least one skylight.
369.468	And this is where Santa Claus
369.468	comes down at the time of Christmas.
379.255	This is the annex building,
381.682	right next to that
381.682	oval-shaped kindergarten.
386.151	The building is only
386.151	five meters tall with seven floors.
391.81	And of course,
391.81	the ceiling height is very low.
393.971	So you have to consider safety.
398.036	So, we put our children,
398.036	a daughter and a son.
403.707	They tried to go in.
407.731	He hit his head.
411.343	He's okay. His skull is quite strong.
415.312	He is resilient. It's my son.
418.4	(Laughter)
421.038	And he is trying to see
421.038	if it is safe to jump off.
425.038	And then we put other children.
432.835	The traffic jam is awful
432.835	in Tokyo, as you know.
435.376	(Laughter)
436.528	The driver in front,
436.528	she needs to learn how to drive.
441.379	Now these days,
443.91	kids need a small dosage of danger.
450.97	And in this kind of occasion,
453.375	they learn to help each other.
457.3	This is society. This is the kind of
457.3	opportunity we are losing these days.
468.065	Now, this drawing is showing
468.065	the movement of a boy
474.976	between 9:10 and 9:30.
481.3	And the circumference
481.3	of this building is 183 meters.
487.501	So it's not exactly small at all.
491.353	And this boy did 6,000 meters
491.353	in the morning.
495.959	But the surprise is yet to come.
499.551	The children in this kindergarten
499.551	do 4,000 meters on average.
507.455	And these children have
507.455	the highest athletic abilities
514.435	among many kindergartens.
523.39	The principal says,
525.016	"""I don't train them."
525.016	We leave them on top of the roof.
531.353	"Just like sheep."""
532.972	(Laughter)
534.401	They keep running.
536.23	(Laughter)
538.779	My point is don't control them,
543.838	don't protect them too much,
547.06	and they need to tumble sometimes.
550.687	They need to get some injury.
554.473	And that makes them learn
557.892	how to live in this world.
563.848	I think architecture is capable
563.848	of changing this world,
571.057	and people's lives.
573.909	And this is one of the attempts
573.909	to change the lives of children.
580.481	Thank you very much.
582.158	(Applause)
