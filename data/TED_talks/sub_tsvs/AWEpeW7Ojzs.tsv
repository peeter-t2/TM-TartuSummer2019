15.816	It's a great time to be a molecular biologist. (Laughter)
19.254	Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier
22.136	and cheaper.
23.668	By the end of this year, we'll be able to sequence
25.838	the three million bits of information
27.542	in your genome in less than a day
30.512	and for less than 1,000 euros.
32.922	Biotech is probably the most powerful
35.752	and the fastest-growing technology sector.
38.776	It has the power, potentially,
42.078	to replace our fossil fuels,
44.295	to revolutionize medicine,
46.512	and to touch every aspect of our daily lives.
50.723	So who gets to do it?
54.555	I think we'd all be pretty comfortable with
57.05	this guy doing it.
60.322	But what about
62.237	that guy? (Laughter)
65.109	(Laughter)
66.979	In 2009, I first heard about DIYbio.
72.453	It's a movement that -- it advocates making biotechnology
76.566	accessible to everyone,
78.647	not just scientists and people in government labs.
82.286	The idea is that if you open up the science
85.826	and you allow diverse groups to participate,
88.629	it could really stimulate innovation.
90.322	Putting technology in the hands of the end user
93.128	is usually a good idea because they've got the best idea
96.317	of what their needs are.
98.42	And here's this really sophisticated technology
101.557	coming down the road, all these associated
104.301	social, moral, ethical questions,
106.998	and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public
110.389	just exactly what it is we're doing in those labs.
114.271	So wouldn't it be nice
116.999	if there was a place in your local neighborhood
119.435	where you could go and learn about this stuff,
122.015	do it hands-on?
124.338	I thought so.
125.853	So, three years ago, I got together
127.733	with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations
131.27	and we founded Genspace.
133.405	It's a nonprofit, a community biotech lab
136.861	in Brooklyn, New York,
138.215	and the idea was people could come,
139.984	they could take classes and putter around in the lab
143.957	in a very open, friendly atmosphere.
148.069	None of my previous experience prepared me
150.71	for what came next. Can you guess?
154.055	The press started calling us.
156.783	And the more we talked about how great it was to increase
159.901	science literacy, the more they wanted to talk
162.573	about us creating the next Frankenstein,
165.701	and as a result, for the next six months,
168.706	when you Googled my name,
170.483	instead of getting my scientific papers, you got this.
174.536	"[""Am I a biohazard?""]"
176.114	(Laughter)
178.247	It was pretty depressing.
180.038	The only thing that got us through that period
182.998	was that we knew that all over the world,
184.859	there were other people that were trying to do
186.445	the same thing that we were.
188.381	They were opening biohacker spaces, and some of them
190.885	were facing much greater challenges than we did,
193.526	more regulations, less resources.
197.643	But now, three years later, here's where we stand.
201.842	It's a vibrant, global community of hackerspaces,
206.26	and this is just the beginning.
208.162	These are some of the biggest ones,
210.223	and there are others opening every day.
212.287	There's one probably going to open up in Moscow,
215.158	one in South Korea,
216.457	and the cool thing is they each have their own
218.783	individual flavor
220.566	that grew out of the community they came out of.
222.89	Let me take you on a little tour.
226.029	Biohackers work alone.
228.477	We work in groups,
231.037	in big cities — (Laughter) —
235.422	and in small villages.
238.092	We reverse engineer lab equipment.
240.86	We genetically engineer bacteria.
243.396	We hack hardware,
245.623	software,
247.868	wetware,
250.292	and, of course, the code of life.
253.228	We like to build things.
256.163	Then we like to take things apart.
262.55	We make things grow.
264.666	We make things glow.
266.468	And we make cells dance.
270.435	The spirit of these labs, it's open, it's positive,
274.226	but, you know, sometimes when people think of us,
276.667	the first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety,
280.694	bio-security, all the dark side stuff.
283.771	I'm not going to minimize those concerns.
286.379	Any powerful technology is inherently dual use,
290.176	and, you know, you get something like
291.393	synthetic biology, nanobiotechnology,
295.243	it really compels you, you have to look at both
297.867	the amateur groups but also the professional groups,
301.28	because they have better infrastructure,
303.731	they have better facilities,
305.279	and they have access to pathogens.
307.778	So the United Nations did just that, and they recently
311.058	issued a report on this whole area,
313.666	and what they concluded was the power of this technology
316.738	for positive was much greater than the risk for negative,
320.59	and they even looked specifically at the DIYbio community,
324.119	and they noted, not surprisingly, that the press
327.664	had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities
331.688	and underestimate our ethics.
334.223	As a matter of fact, DIY people from all over the world,
337.752	America, Europe, got together last year,
340.482	and we hammered out a common code of ethics.
343.031	That's a lot more than conventional science has done.
346.391	Now, we follow state and local regulations.
350.039	We dispose of our waste properly, we follow
352.035	safety procedures, we don't work with pathogens.
355.376	You know, if you're working with a pathogen,
358.079	you're not part of the biohacker community,
360.623	you're part of the bioterrorist community, I'm sorry.
363.776	And sometimes people ask me,
365.699	"""Well, what about an accident?"""
367.586	Well, working with the safe organisms that we normally
371.144	work with, the chance of an accident happening
374.503	with somebody accidentally creating, like,
376.831	some sort of superbug,
378.477	that's literally about as probable as a snowstorm
382.727	in the middle of the Sahara Desert.
384.799	Now, it could happen,
386.153	but I'm not going to plan my life around it.
390.309	I've actually chosen to take a different kind of risk.
393.239	I signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project.
396.351	It's a study at Harvard where, at the end of the study,
398.823	they're going to take my entire genomic sequence,
401.591	all of my medical information, and my identity,
405.263	and they're going to post it online for everyone to see.
409.405	There were a lot of risks involved that they talked about
412.335	during the informed consent portion.
414.111	The one I liked the best is,
415.994	someone could download my sequence, go back to the lab,
419.839	synthesize some fake Ellen DNA,
422.133	and plant it at a crime scene. (Laughter)
426.207	But like DIYbio, the positive outcomes and
430.737	the potential for good for a study like that
433.883	far outweighs the risk.
435.935	Now, you might be asking yourself,
438.336	"""Well, you know, what would I do in a biolab?"""
441.773	"Well, it wasn't that long ago we were asking, ""Well,"
445.102	"what would anyone do with a personal computer?"""
448.167	So this stuff is just beginning.
450.131	We're only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg.
454.007	Let me show you what you could do right now.
457.092	A biohacker in Germany, a journalist, wanted to know
460.927	whose dog was leaving little presents on his street?
464.161	(Laughter) (Applause)
467.071	Yep, you guessed it. He threw tennis balls
469.777	to all the neighborhood dogs, analyzed the saliva,
473.039	identified the dog, and confronted the dog owner.
476.933	(Laughter) (Applause)
483.209	I discovered an invasive species in my own backyard.
486.513	Looked like a ladybug, right?
488.453	It actually is a Japanese beetle.
490.501	And the same kind of technology --
492.412	it's called DNA barcoding, it's really cool --
494.496	You can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga,
499.362	if that sushi is really tuna, or if that goat cheese
502.595	that you paid so much for is really goat's.
506.009	In a biohacker space, you can analyze your genome
509.91	for mutations.
511.202	You can analyze your breakfast cereal for GMO's,
514.426	and you can explore your ancestry.
517.344	You can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere,
519.701	collect microbes, see what's up there.
523.323	You can make a biocensor out of yeast
525.754	to detect pollutants in water.
527.941	You can make some sort of a biofuel cell.
531.573	You can do a lot of things.
533.866	You can also do an art science project. Some of these
537.256	are really spectacular, and they look at social,
540.897	ecological problems from a completely different perspective.
543.583	It's really cool.
545.145	Some people ask me, well, why am I involved?
548.163	I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science.
552.258	The thing is, there's something in these labs
554.786	that they have to offer society that you can't find
557.445	anywhere else.
559.412	There's something sacred about a space where
562.09	you can work on a project, and you don't have to justify
564.602	to anyone that it's going to make a lot of money,
567.476	that it's going to save mankind, or even that it's feasible.
570.731	It just has to follow safety guidelines.
573.658	If you had spaces like this all over the world,
576.514	it could really change the perception
578.746	of who's allowed to do biotech.
581.278	It's spaces like these that spawned personal computing.
584.97	Why not personal biotech?
587.386	If everyone in this room got involved,
589.763	who knows what we could do?
591.511	This is such a new area, and as we say back in Brooklyn,
595.271	you ain't seen nothin' yet. (Laughter)
598.551	(Applause)
