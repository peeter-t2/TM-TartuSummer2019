12.378	Hi.
13.645	Today I'm going to share
13.645	my personal journey
16.837	with female genital mutilation, FGM.
21.838	Feel free to cry, laugh, cross your legs,
25.557	or do anything your body feels like doing.
27.828	I'm not going to name
27.828	the things your body does.
31.086	I was born in Sierra Leone.
33.302	"Did anybody watch ""Blood Diamond""?"
36.993	If you have any thoughts --
38.888	I don't have any diamonds 
38.888	on me, by the way.
42.096	If you have heard of Ebola,
42.096	well, that's in Sierra Leone as well.
45.355	I don't have Ebola. You're all safe.
47.113	Don't rush to the door.
48.527	Be seated. You're fine.
48.527	I was checked before I got here.
53.397	My grandfather had three wives.
56.246	Don't ask me why a man
56.246	needs more than one wife.
58.575	Men, do you need more than one wife?
60.584	I don't think so. There you go.
62.292	He was looking for a heart attack,
62.292	that's what I say.
65.926	Oh yeah, he was.
68.329	When I was three, war broke out
68.329	in Sierra Leone in 1991.
72.452	I remember literally going to bed
72.452	one night, everything was good.
76.428	The next day, I woke up,
78.14	bombs were dropping everywhere,
80.081	and people were trying
80.081	to kill me and my family.
82.662	We escaped the war and ended up
82.662	in Gambia, in West Africa.
87.465	Ebola is there as well. Stay away from it.
91.315	While we were there as refugees,
92.868	we didn't know what
92.868	was going to become of us.
96.684	My mom applied for refugee status.
98.573	She's a wonderful, smart woman, that one,
101.304	and we were lucky.
102.583	Australia said, we will take you in.
105.393	Good job, Aussies.
108.089	Before we were meant to travel,
111.35	my mom came home one day, and said,
113.192	"""We're going on "
113.192	"a little holiday, a little trip."""
116.37	She put us in a car,
117.668	and we drove for hours
117.668	and ended up in a bush
121.273	in a remote area in Gambia.
125.568	In this bush, we found two huts.
128.447	An old lady came towards us.
131.899	She was ethnic-looking, very old.
134.646	She had a chat with my mom, and went back.
137.68	Then she came back and walked
137.68	away from us into a second hut.
142.188	I'm standing there thinking,
143.552	"""This is very confusing."
143.552	"I don't know what's going on."""
146.221	The next thing I knew,
148.023	my mom took me into this hut.
151.329	She took my clothes off,
153.065	and then she pinned me down on the floor.
157.347	I struggled and tried
157.347	to get her off me, but I couldn't.
160.935	Then the old lady came towards me
160.935	with a rusty-looking knife,
164.53	one of the sharp knives,
166.41	orange-looking, has never seen
166.41	water or sunlight before.
170.613	I thought she was going to slaughter me,
172.317	but she didn't.
174.344	She slowly slid down my body
177.486	and ended up where my vagina is.
181.703	She took hold of what I now know
181.703	to be my clitoris,
186.969	she took that rusty knife,
186.969	and started cutting away, inch by inch.
194.729	I screamed, I cried,
199.056	and asked my mom to get off me
199.056	so this pain will stop,
203.747	"but all she did was say, ""Be quiet."""
206.928	This old lady sawed away at my flesh
206.928	for what felt like forever,
212.956	and then when she was done,
215.019	she threw that piece of flesh
215.019	across the floor
218.834	as if it was the most disgusting thing
218.834	she's ever touched.
223.46	They both got off me,
223.46	and left me there bleeding,
226.966	crying, and confused
226.966	as to what just happened.
233.703	We never talked about this again.
235.805	Very soon, we found
235.805	that we were coming to Australia,
239.28	and this is when you had
239.28	the Sydney Olympics at the time,
242.015	and people said we were going
242.015	to the end of the world,
244.572	there was nowhere else
244.572	to go after Australia.
246.669	Yeah, that comforted us a bit.
249.294	It took us three days to get here.
251.607	We went to Senegal, then France,
251.607	and then Singapore.
256.335	We went to the bathroom to wash our hands.
259.144	We spent 15 minutes
259.144	opening the tap like this.
263.864	Then somebody came in,
265.651	slid their hand under and water came out,
267.748	and we thought, is this what we're in for?
270.255	Like, seriously.
272.833	We got to Adelaide, small place,
275.641	where literally they dumped us
275.641	in Adelaide, that's what I would say.
278.968	They dumped us there.
280.407	We were very grateful.
282.015	We settled and we liked it.
283.678	"We were like, ""We're home, we're here."""
285.937	Then somebody took us to Rundle Mall.
288.571	Adelaide has only one mall.
289.88	It's this small place.
293.106	And we saw a lot of Asian people.
295.028	My mom said all of a sudden, panicking,
297.23	"""You brought us to the wrong place."
297.23	"You must take us back to Australia."""
303.73	Yeah. It had to be explained to her that 
303.73	there were a lot of Asians in Australia
308.851	and we were in the right place.
310.509	So fine, it's all good.
313.321	My mom then had this brilliant idea
315.166	that I should go to a girls school
315.166	because they were less racist.
318.482	I don't know where she read 
318.482	that publication. (Laughter)
321.693	Never found evidence of it to this day.
325.29	Six hundred white kids, 
325.29	and I was the only black child there.
329.046	No, I was the only person
329.046	with a bit of a color on me.
332.112	Let me say that. Chocolate color.
335.444	There were no Asians, no indigenous.
338.055	All we had was some tan girls,
339.782	girls who felt the need
339.782	to be under the sun.
341.899	It wasn't the same as my chocolate,
341.899	though. Not the same.
345.684	Settling in Australia was quite hard,
348.382	but it became harder when I started
348.382	volunteering for an organization
351.7	called Women's Health Statewide,
355.552	and I joined their
355.552	female genital mutilation program
358.411	without any awareness of what
358.411	this program was actually about,
362.161	or that it related to me in any way.
364.616	I spent months educating
364.616	nurses and doctors
367.566	about what female genital mutilation was
370.103	and where it was practiced:
371.592	Africa, the Middle East, Asia,
371.592	and now, Australia and London and America,
376.879	because, as we all know,
376.879	we live in a multicultural society,
380.362	and people who come from those backgrounds
380.362	come with their culture,
384.765	and sometimes they have cultural practices
384.765	that we may not agree with,
390.47	but they continue to practice them.
393.741	One day, I was looking at the chart
395.662	of the different types
395.662	of female genital mutilation,
398.984	FGM, I will just say FGM for short.
401.441	Type I is when they cut off the hood.
404.609	Type II is when
404.609	they cut off the whole clitoris
407.877	and some of your labia majora,
407.877	or your outer lips,
412.002	and Type III is when they 
412.002	cut off the whole clitoris
414.739	and then they sew you up
416.584	so you only have a little hole
416.584	to pee and have your period.
420.694	My eyes went onto Type II.
423.016	Before all of this,
423.016	I pretty much had amnesia.
425.306	I was in so much shock 
425.306	and traumatized by what had happened,
428.733	I didn't remember any of it.
430.864	Yes, I was aware something bad
430.864	happened to me,
433.139	but I had no recollection
433.139	of what had happened.
435.351	I knew I had a scar down there,
437.312	but I thought everybody
437.312	had a scar down there.
439.455	This had happened to everybody else.
441.188	But when I looked at Type II,
441.188	it all came back to me.
445.397	I remembered what was done to me.
447.733	I remembered being in that hut
449.74	with that old lady and my mom
449.74	holding me down.
454.809	Words cannot express the pain I felt,
459.214	the confusion that I felt,
462.191	because now I realized that 
462.191	what was done to me was a terrible thing
466.993	that in this society was called barbaric,
469.977	it was called mutilation.
471.944	My mother had said
471.944	it was called circumcision,
474.107	but here it was mutilation.
476.327	I was thinking, I'm mutilated?
476.327	I'm a mutilated person.
479.384	Oh my God.
481.114	And then the anger came.
483.002	I was a black angry woman.
483.002	(Laughter)
487.002	Oh yeah.
488.379	A little one, but angry nevertheless.
491.994	I went home and said to my mom,
495.72	"""You did something."""
497.665	This is not the African thing to do,
497.665	pointing at your mother,
500.551	but hey, I was ready for any consequences.
502.762	"""You did something to me."""
504.892	"She's like, ""What are you"
504.892	"talking about, Khadija?"""
507.25	She's used to me mouthing off.
508.936	"I'm like, ""Those years ago,"
508.936	You circumcised me.
513.111	You cut away something
513.111	"that belonged to me."""
516.594	"She said, ""Yes, I did."
518.414	I did it for your own good.
523.144	It was in your best interest.
525.232	Your grandmother did it to me,
525.232	and I did it to you.
528.417	"It's made you a woman."""
530.368	"I'm like, ""How?"""
532.12	"She said, ""You're empowered, Khadija."
534.206	"Do you get itchy down there?"""
536.023	"I'm like, ""No, why would I"
536.023	"get itchy down there?"""
538.341	"She said, ""Well,"
538.341	if you were not circumcised,
541.02	you would get itchy down there.
543.179	Women who are not circumcised
543.179	get itchy all the time.
546.314	Then they sleep around with everybody.
549.373	You are not going
549.373	"to sleep around with anybody."""
552.185	And I thought,
553.919	her definition of empowerment
553.919	was very strange. (Laughter)
560.827	That was the end
560.827	of our first conversation.
563.078	I went back to school.
564.389	These were the days when we had 
564.389	Dolly and Girlfriend magazines.
567.885	There was always the sealed section.
567.885	Anybody remember those sealed sections?
572.152	The naughty bits, you know?
574.226	Oh yeah, I love those.
574.226	(Laughter)
577.101	Anyway, there was always
577.101	an article about pleasure
580.694	and relationships and, of course, sex.
583.96	But it always assumed
583.96	that you had a clitoris, though,
587.966	and I thought, this doesn't fit me.
591.649	This doesn't talk about people like me.
594.467	I don't have a clitoris.
596.12	I watched TV and those women
596.12	"would moan like, ""Oh! Oh!"""
600.272	I was like, these people
600.272	and their damned clitoris.
603.275	(Laughter)
604.958	What is a woman without a clitoris
604.958	supposed to do with her life?
608.991	That's what I want to know.
610.524	I want to do that too --
610.524	"""Oh! Oh!"" and all of that."
614.394	Didn't happen.
616.072	So I came home once again
616.072	and said to my mom,
619.157	"""Dolly and Girlfriend said"
619.157	I deserve pleasure,
623.653	that I should be having orgasms,
625.603	and that white men should figure out
625.603	"how to find the clitoris."""
630.248	Apparently, white men
630.248	have a problem finding the clitoris.
633.504	(Laughter)
635.41	Just saying, it wasn't me.
635.41	It was Dolly that said that.
640.017	And I thought to myself,
640.017	I had an inner joke in my head
643.608	"that said, ""I will marry a white man."
646.719	"He won't have that problem with me."""
646.719	(Laughter)
650.3	So I said to my mom,
651.836	"""Dolly and Girlfriend said"
651.836	I deserve pleasure, and do you know
658.935	what you have taken away from me,
658.935	what you have denied me?
662.72	You have invaded me
662.72	in the most sacred way.
665.893	I want pleasure.
667.446	"I want to get horny, dammit, as well."""
670.751	And she said to me,
670.751	"""Who is Dolly and Girlfriend?"
673.469	"Are they your new friends, Khadija?"""
675.929	"I was like, ""No, they're not."
675.929	"That's a magazine, mom, a magazine."""
679.784	She didn't get it.
681.399	We came from two different worlds.
683.507	When she was growing up,
683.507	not having a clitoris was the norm.
687.112	It was celebrated.
689.786	I was an African Australian girl.
692.153	I lived in a society
692.153	that was very clitoris-centric.
695.962	It was all about the damn clitoris!
700.193	And I didn't have one!
701.912	That pissed me off.
705.466	So once I went through
705.466	this strange phase of anger
709.27	and pain and confusion,
710.976	I remember booking
710.976	an appointment with my therapist.
713.56	Yes, I'm an African 
713.56	who has a therapist. There you go.
716.585	And I said to her,
719.566	"""I was 13. I was a child."
722.001	I was settling in a new country,
723.524	I was dealing with racism
723.524	and discrimination,
726.569	English is my third language,
726.569	"and then there it was."""
729.463	"I said to her, ""I feel like"
729.463	I'm not a woman
732.35	because of what was done to me.
734.774	I feel incomplete.
737.53	"Am I going to be asexual?"""
740.901	Because from what I knew about FGM,
743.704	the whole aim of it was to control
743.704	the sexuality of women.
747.386	It's so that we don't have
747.386	any sexual desire.
750.53	"And I said, ""Am I asexual now?"
752.317	Will I just live the rest of my life
752.317	not feeling like having sex,
755.678	"not enjoying sex?"""
758.19	She couldn't answer my questions,
760.81	so they went unanswered.
763.463	When I started having my period
763.463	around the age of 14,
766.092	I realized I didn't have 
766.092	normal periods because of FGM.
769.973	My periods were heavy, they were long,
769.973	and they were very painful.
775.726	Then they told me I had fibroids.
777.709	They're like these little balls
777.709	sitting there.
780.336	One was covering one of my ovaries.
783.08	And there came then the big news.
786.165	"""We don't think you can"
786.165	"have children, Khadija."""
789.416	And once again, I was
789.416	an angry black woman.
794.138	I went home and I said to my mom,
797.313	"""Your act, your action,"
797.313	"no matter what your may defense may be"" --"
801.807	because she thought she did it out love --
804.401	"""what you did out of love "
804.401	is harming me, and it's hurting me.
809.029	"What do you have to say for that?"""
812.851	"She said, ""I did what I had to do"
812.851	"as a mother."""
816.035	I'm still waiting
816.035	for an apology, by the way.
820.124	Then I got married.
823.811	And once again --
825.949	FGM is like the gift that keeps giving.
828.177	You figure that out very soon.
830.862	Sex was very painful.
833.888	It hurt all the time.
836.138	And of course I realized, they said,
836.138	"""You can't have kids."""
839.836	"I thought, ""Wow, is this my existence?"
839.836	"Is this what life is all about?"""
848.843	I'm proud to tell you,
851.045	five months ago,
852.921	I was told I was pregnant.
855.435	(Applause)
864.027	I am the lucky girl.
865.842	There are so many women out there
865.842	who have gone through FGM
868.652	who have infertility.
870.283	I know a nine-year-old girl who has
870.283	incontinence, constant infections, pain.
877.513	It's that gift. It doesn't stop giving.
880.14	It affects every area of your life,
883.286	and this happened to me
883.286	because I was born a girl
886.572	in the wrong place.
888.301	That's why it happened to me.
890.845	I channel all that anger, 
890.845	all that pain, into advocacy
895.121	because I needed my pain
895.121	to be worth something.
898.587	So I'm the director of an organization
898.587	called No FGM Australia.
902.663	You heard me right.
904.107	Why No FGM Australia?
905.775	FGM is in Australia.
908.941	Two days ago, I had to call
908.941	Child Protective Services,
912.606	because somewhere in Australia,
915.401	there's a four-year old
917.547	there's a four-year-old whose mom 
917.547	is planning on performing FGM on her.
922.277	That child is in kindy.
922.277	I'll let that sink in: four years old.
931.432	A couple of months ago, I met a lady
931.432	who is married to a Malaysian man.
935.763	Her husband came home one day and said
935.763	he was going to take their daughters
939.334	back to Malaysia
939.334	to cut off their clitoris.
941.709	"And she said, ""Why?"""
941.709	He said they were dirty.
945.91	"And she said, ""Well, you married me."""
947.728	"He said, ""Oh, this is my cultural belief."""
951.278	They then went into a whole discussion
951.278	where she said to him,
954.163	"""Over my dead body"
954.163	"will you do that to my daughters."""
957.255	But imagine if this woman
957.255	wasn't aware of what FGM was,
961.004	if they never had that conversation?
963.161	Her children would have been
963.161	flown over to Malaysia
966.399	and they would have come back
966.399	changed for the rest of their lives.
969.709	Do you know the millions of dollars
971.416	it would take us to deal
971.416	with an issue like that?
973.802	[Three children per day] in Australia
976.561	are at risk of having FGM
976.561	performed on them.
979.76	This is an Australian problem, people.
982.261	It's not an African problem.
982.261	It's not a Middle Eastern problem.
985.268	It's not white, it's not black,
985.268	it has no color, it's everybody's problem.
990.411	FGM is child abuse.
993.844	It's violence against women.
995.754	It's saying that women don't have
995.754	a right to sexual pleasure.
999.769	It says we don't have
999.769	a right to our bodies.
1002.804	Well, I say no to that,
1002.804	and you know what? Bullshit.
1006.613	That's what I have to say to that.
1008.719	(Applause)
1014.999	I am proud to say that
1014.999	I'm doing my part in ending FGM.
1020.514	What are you going to do?
1022.646	There may be a child in your classroom
1022.646	who is at risk of FGM.
1027.297	There may be a patient
1027.297	who comes to your hospital
1030.393	who is at risk of FGM.
1032.026	But this is the reality,
1034.385	that even in our beloved Australia,
1036.465	the most wonderful place in the world,
1038.567	children are being abused
1038.567	because of a culture.
1042.653	Culture should not be
1042.653	a defense for child abuse.
1045.612	I want ever single one of you
1045.612	to see FGM as an issue for you.
1050.655	Make it personal.
1052.141	It could be your daughter,
1052.141	your sister, your cousin.
1055.23	I can't fight FGM alone.
1058.321	I could try, but I can't.
1060.928	So my appeal to you is, please join me.
1063.733	Sign my petition on Change.org
1065.846	and type in Khadija, my name,
1065.846	and it'll come up, and sign it.
1069.833	The aim of that is to get support
1069.833	for FGM victims in Australia
1073.425	and to protect little girls
1073.425	growing up here
1075.688	to not have this evil done to them,
1078.826	because every child
1078.826	has a right to pleasure.
1082.509	Every child has a right
1082.509	to their bodies being left intact,
1085.97	and dammit, ever child
1085.97	has a right to a clitoris.
1090.687	So please join me in ending this act.
1094.352	My favorite quote is,
1096.501	"""All it takes for evil to prevail"
1098.349	is for a few good men
1098.349	"and women to do nothing."""
1101.783	Are you going to let this evil
1101.783	of female genital mutilation
1106.652	to prevail in Australia?
1108.884	I don't think so,
1110.172	so please join me in ensuring
1110.172	that it ends in my generation.
1114.198	Thank you.
1116.269	(Applause)
