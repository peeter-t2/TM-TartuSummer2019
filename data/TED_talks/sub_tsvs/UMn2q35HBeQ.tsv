12.502	You may want to take a closer look.
14.708	There's more to this painting than meets the eye.
17.942	And yes, it's an acrylic painting of a man,
21.932	but I didn't paint it on canvas.
24.364	I painted it directly on top of the man.
27.652	What I do in my art is I skip the canvas altogether,
30.386	and if I want to paint your portrait,
32.252	I'm painting it on you, physically on you.
35.892	That also means you're probably going to end up
37.645	with an earful of paint,
39.553	because I need to paint your ear on your ear.
43.636	Everything in this scene, the person, the clothes,
46.252	chairs, wall, gets covered in a mask of paint
49.925	that mimics what's directly below it,
52.686	and in this way, I'm able to take a three-dimensional scene
56.4	and make it look like a two-dimensional painting.
59.621	I can photograph it from any angle,
61.819	and it will still look 2D.
64.842	There's no Photoshop here.
67.855	This is just a photo
69.617	of one of my three-dimensional paintings.
73.288	You might be wondering how I came up with this idea
75.408	of turning people into paintings.
77.672	But originally, this had nothing to do
80.466	with either people or paint.
82.68	It was about shadows.
85.072	I was fascinated with the absence of light,
87.692	and I wanted to find a way that I could give it materiality
91.143	and pin it down before it changed.
93.876	I came up with the idea of painting shadows.
96.401	I loved that I could hide within this shadow
98.592	my own painted version,
100.696	and it would be almost invisible
103.133	until the light changed, and all of a sudden
105.656	my shadow would be brought to the light.
108.817	I wanted to think about what else I could put shadows on,
111.88	and I thought of my friend Bernie.
114.16	But I didn't just want to paint the shadows.
117.39	I also wanted to paint the highlights
119.296	and create a mapping on his body in greyscale.
122.586	I had a very specific vision of what this would look like,
126.307	and as I was painting him,
128.48	I made sure to follow that very closely.
130.999	But something kept on flickering before my eyes.
133.88	I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at.
135.96	And then when I took that moment to take a step back,
139.566	magic.
141.242	I had turned my friend into a painting.
144.952	I couldn't have foreseen that
145.94	when I wanted to paint a shadow,
148.495	I would pull out this whole other dimension,
150.389	that I would collapse it,
151.747	that I would take a painting and make it my friend
156.272	and then bring him back to a painting.
159.706	I was a little conflicted though,
161.798	because I was so excited about what I'd found,
165.12	but I was just about to graduate from college
167.424	with a degree in political science,
169.2	and I'd always had this dream
171.734	of going to Washington, D.C.,
173.96	and sitting at a desk
176.202	and working in government.
178.92	(Laughter)
180.968	Why did this have to get in the way of all that?
184.168	I made the tough decision
185.746	of going home after graduation
189.158	and not going up to Capitol Hill,
192.258	but going down to my parents' basement
194.4	and making it my job to learn how to paint.
197.87	I had no idea where to begin.
201.182	The last time I'd painted,
202.727	I was 16 years old at summer camp,
205.166	and I didn't want to teach myself how to paint
207.614	by copying the old masters
209.853	or stretching a canvas
211.199	and practicing over and over again on that surface,
214.576	because that's not what this project was about for me.
217.38	It was about space and light.
220.482	My early canvases ended up being
223.325	things that you wouldn't expect to be used as canvas,
226.602	like fried food.
228.76	It's nearly impossible
230.884	to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg.
233.67	(Laughter)
235.746	Even harder was getting paint to stick
238.228	to the acid in a grapefruit.
240.494	It just would erase my brush strokes
243.606	like invisible ink.
245.037	I'd put something down, and instantly it would be gone.
248.681	And if I wanted to paint on people,
250.783	well, I was a little bit embarrassed
253.519	to bring people down into my studio
255.327	and show them that I spent my days in a basement
258.387	putting paint on toast.
261.523	It just seemed like it made more sense
263.382	to practice by painting on myself.
266.611	One of my favorite models actually ended up being
269.537	a retired old man
271.321	who not only didn't mind sitting still
273.6	and getting the paint in his ears,
276.149	but he also didn't really have much embarrassment
278.798	about being taken out into very public places
280.789	for exhibition,
282.401	like the Metro.
285.72	I was having so much fun with this process.
289.447	I was teaching myself how to paint in all these different styles,
293.691	and I wanted to see what else I could do with it.
296.856	I came together with a collaborator, Sheila Vand,
299.813	and we had the idea of creating paintings
302.121	in a more unusual surface,
304.838	and that was milk.
307.795	We got a pool. We filled it with milk.
310.214	We filled it with Sheila. And I began painting.
313.19	And the images were always
315.199	completely unexpected in the end,
317.383	because I could have a very specific image
320.127	about how it would turn out,
321.45	I could paint it to match that,
323.706	but the moment that Sheila laid back into the milk,
326.272	everything would change.
328.118	It was in constant flux,
330.134	and we had to, rather than fight it, embrace it,
333.401	see where the milk would take us
334.645	and compensate to make it even better.
338.789	Sometimes, when Sheila would lay down in the milk,
342.047	it would wash all the paint off of her arms,
344.641	and it might seem a little bit clumsy,
347.795	but our solution would be, okay, hide your arms.
350.865	And one time, she got so much milk in her hair
353.923	that it just smeared all the paint off of her face.
356.801	All right, well, hide your face.
359.076	And we ended up with something far more elegant
362.487	than we could have imagined,
364.332	even though this is essentially the same solution
366.547	that a frustrated kid uses when he can't draw hands,
369.918	just hiding them in the pockets.
373.075	When we started out on the milk project,
375.609	and when I started out,
377.139	I couldn't have foreseen that I would go
380.043	from pursuing my dream in politics
382.444	and working at a desk
384.145	to tripping over a shadow
385.911	and then turning people into paintings
388.979	and painting on people in a pool of milk.
392.259	But then again, I guess it's also not unforeseeable
395.667	that you can find the strange in the familiar,
398.691	as long as you're willing to look beyond
400.196	what's already been brought to light,
401.767	that you can see what's below the surface,
404.014	hiding in the shadows,
406.005	and recognize that there can be more there
408.699	than meets the eye.
410.571	Thank you.
411.944	(Applause)
