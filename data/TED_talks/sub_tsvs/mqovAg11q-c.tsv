12.601	I'm an artist and I cut books.
14.61	This is one of my first book works.
16.316	"It's called ""Alternate"
16.316	"Route to Knowledge."""
18.34	I wanted to create a stack of books so
18.34	that somebody could come into the gallery
22.132	and think they're just looking
22.132	at a regular stack of books,
24.952	but then as they got closer they would
24.952	see this rough hole carved into it,
28.441	and wonder what was happening,
28.441	wonder why,
30.417	and think about the material of the book.
32.453	So I'm interested in the texture,
34.543	but I'm more interested in the text
34.543	and the images that we find within books.
39.623	In most of my work, what I do is I seal
39.623	the edges of a book with a thick varnish
43.524	so it's creating sort of a skin
43.524	on the outside of the book
46.334	so it becomes a solid material,
46.334	but then the pages inside are still loose,
50.202	and then I carve
50.202	into the surface of the book,
52.352	and I'm not moving or adding anything.
54.883	I'm just carving around
54.883	whatever I find interesting.
57.762	So everything you see
57.762	within the finished piece
60.223	is exactly where it was
60.223	in the book before I began.
64.666	I think of my work as sort of
64.666	a remix, in a way,
67.014	because I'm working with
67.014	somebody else's material
69.345	in the same way that a D.J. might be
69.345	working with somebody else's music.
72.973	This was a book of Raphael paintings,
72.973	the Renaissance artist,
76.918	and by taking his work
76.918	and remixing it, carving into it,
81.353	I'm sort of making it into something
81.353	that's more new and more contemporary.
85.915	I'm thinking also about breaking out
85.915	of the box of the traditional book
89.781	and pushing that linear format,
91.917	and try to push the structure
91.917	of the book itself
95.9	so that the book can become
95.9	fully sculptural.
101.303	I'm using clamps and ropes
101.303	and all sorts of materials, weights,
105.068	in order to hold things 
105.068	in place before I varnish
108.04	so that I can push the form 
108.04	before I begin,
110.6	so that something like this
110.6	can become a piece like this,
115.242	which is just made
115.242	from a single dictionary.
118.13	Or something like this
118.13	can become a piece like this.
126.768	Or something like this,
128.244	which who knows what that's going to be
128.244	or why that's in my studio,
132.255	will become a piece like this.
136.997	So I think one of the reasons
136.997	people are disturbed by destroying books,
140.685	people don't want to rip books
142.228	and nobody really wants
142.228	to throw away a book,
144.359	is that we think about books
144.359	as living things,
146.552	we think about them as a body,
148.223	and they're created
148.223	to relate to our body, as far as scale,
151.313	but they also have the potential
151.313	to continue to grow
153.741	and to continue to become new things.
155.731	So books really are alive.
158.458	So I think of the book as a body,
160.988	and I think of the book as a technology.
163.692	I think of the book as a tool.
168.111	And I also think of the book as a machine.
172.435	I also think of the book as a landscape.
174.809	This is a full set of encyclopedias
174.809	that's been connected and sanded together,
179.081	and as I carve through it,
181.334	I'm deciding what I want to choose.
183.275	So with encyclopedias,
183.275	I could have chosen anything,
185.863	but I specifically chose
185.863	images of landscapes.
190.03	And with the material itself,
190.03	I'm using sandpaper
192.966	and sanding the edges
192.966	so not only the images suggest landscape,
196.658	but the material itself
196.658	suggests a landscape as well.
201.456	So one of the things I do
201.456	is when I'm carving through the book,
204.889	I'm thinking about images,
204.889	but I'm also thinking about text,
208.57	and I think about them
208.57	in a very similar way,
210.775	because what's interesting
210.775	is that when we're reading text,
213.647	when we're reading a book,
215.146	it puts images in our head,
216.615	so we're sort of filling that piece.
218.638	We're sort of creating images
218.638	when we're reading text,
222.039	and when we're looking at an image,
222.039	we actually use language
224.916	in order to understand
224.916	what we're looking at.
227.632	So there's sort of
227.632	a yin-yang that happens,
229.861	sort of a flip flop.
231.138	So I'm creating a piece
231.138	that the viewer is completing themselves.
237.477	And I think of my work
237.477	as almost an archaeology.
240.96	I'm excavating and I'm trying
240.96	to maximize the potential
243.979	and discover as much as I possibly can
246.068	and exposing it within my own work.
250.219	But at the same time,
251.896	I'm thinking about this idea of erasure,
253.87	and what's happening now that most
253.87	of our information is intangible,
258.351	and this idea of loss,
261.393	and this idea that not only is the format
261.393	constantly shifting within computers,
265.711	but the information itself,
268.033	now that we don't have a physical backup,
270.262	has to be constantly updated
270.262	in order to not lose it.
275.843	And I have several dictionaries
275.843	in my own studio,
278.623	and I do use a computer every day,
281.14	and if I need to look up a word,
281.14	I'll go on the computer,
283.933	because I can go directly
283.933	and instantly to what I'm looking up.
287.259	I think that the book was never really
289.209	the right format
289.209	for nonlinear information,
292.204	which is why we're seeing reference books
294.278	becoming the first to be 
294.278	endangered or extinct.
301.743	So I don't think that the book
301.743	will ever really die.
304.51	People think that now that we have
304.51	digital technology,
308.806	the book is going to die,
310.178	and we are seeing things shifting
310.178	and things evolving.
313.381	I think that the book will evolve,
315.505	and just like people said
315.505	painting would die
318.767	when photography and printmaking
318.767	became everyday materials,
323.167	but what it really allowed painting to do
325.154	was it allowed painting
325.154	to quit its day job.
327.706	It allowed painting to not have to have
327.706	that everyday chore of telling the story,
334.022	and painting became free
334.022	and was allowed to tell its own story,
337.435	and that's when we saw Modernism emerge,
339.512	and we saw painting
339.512	go into different branches.
341.754	And I think that's what's
341.754	happening with books now,
344.238	now that most of our technology,
344.238	most of our information,
346.933	most of our personal and cultural 
346.933	records are in digital form,
351.127	I think it's really allowing the book
351.127	to become something new.
354.079	So I think it's a very exciting time
354.079	for an artist like me,
356.869	and it's very exciting to see what
356.869	will happen with the book in the future.
360.439	Thank you.
361.768	(Applause)
