12.378	I came here to show you
14.544	the Fotokite.
15.829	It's a tethered, flying camera.
17.931	But before I do that, I want to tell you a bit about
20.17	where it came from, what motivated it.
22.344	So I was born in Russia,
23.839	and three years ago, in 2011,
26.948	there were the Russian federal elections.
29.734	There were massive irregularities reported,
31.819	and people came out to protest,
33.476	which was very unlikely for Russia.
37.17	And no one really knew
38.755	how significant these protests were,
40.839	because, for whatever reason,
42.253	the world media largely ignored it.
44.237	Now, there was a group of photographers
46.319	who kind of flew flying cameras as a hobby —
49.637	usually photographing things like the Sphinx,
52.55	the Pyramids — who happened to be
55.318	right around the corner, and they flew a camera
57.973	and they took some snapshots,
59.749	some panoramas of this demonstration.
62.326	Just completely independent entity,
64.159	completely random occurrence,
66.218	and the image, when I saw it, it really struck me.
69.886	Here's one of the panoramas.
71.46	So in a single image,
72.975	you can really see the scale of this event —
76.77	just the number of people,
79.838	the colors, the banners.
82.525	You just can't consider this insignificant.
86.366	All in a single image, which was really cool to me.
89.368	And I think, in the future,
91.427	journalism and many other professions,
93.913	there are flying cameras already
93.913	quite commonly out there,
96.432	but I think, you wait a few months, a few years,
99.873	and for many professions, it's really going to be
101.91	a requirement.
103.755	And it make sense. It's 
103.755	such a unique perspective.
105.994	Nothing really communicates 
105.994	this scale, for example,
109.483	in context, in a way that this does.
112.507	But there are a few hurdles, 
112.507	and they are quite basic
114.925	and quite fundamental.
116.962	One is piloting.
118.211	So for this image, they flew a camera,
122.136	a five kilogram device with an SLR under it.
126.962	It's quite heavy, lots of 
126.962	spinning, sharp things.
131.438	It's a bit uncomfortable to fly,
133.868	probably also for the operator.
135.345	In fact, you can see that on the 
135.345	back of the pilot's shirt, it says,
138.907	"""No questions until landing"""
140.966	in Russian and in English,
142.85	because people are curious, and they'll go tap you,
145.224	and then you lose your focus and things happen.
147.732	And these guys are great. They're professionals;
149.947	they're really careful in what they do.
152.94	So in the protests, maybe you noticed,
155.549	they flew over the river so it was quite safe.
158.407	But this doesn't necessarily apply to
161.411	all people and all conditions,
163.12	so we really have to make piloting easier.
165.517	The other problem is regulations,
167.799	or rather, the lack of good regulation.
170.825	For many good reasons, it's just difficult
172.738	to come up with common sense laws
174.86	to regulate flying cameras.
176.911	So we already have cameras.
179.239	Everyone here, I'm sure, has a
179.239	smartphone with a camera, right?
181.815	There are more and more of them.
183.447	You hear about people with
183.447	Google Glass being attacked.
185.621	You hear about, actually, a drone pilot,
188.321	a hobbyist, was attacked two weeks ago
190.222	because he was flying near a beach.
192.348	Here's some personal input I didn't expect.
194.575	Just yesterday, I was attacked by a guy
197.267	who claimed that I was filming him.
199.818	I was checking my email right here —
202.517	easy way to get input for your talk.
206.16	But I think there are better solutions.
207.939	I think we have to defuse the situation.
209.908	We have to come up with responsible solutions
213.249	that address the privacy issues
214.926	and the safety, accountability issues
217.726	but still give us that perspective.
221.539	And this is one potential solution.
224.722	So this is the Fotokite.
227.643	Well, let me see, it's a quadrocopter,
229.526	but what's kind of special 
229.526	about it is there's a leash.
233.834	It's literally a dog leash. It's very convenient.
236.928	And the neat thing about it is,
239.155	to fly it, there's no joysticks, nothing like this.
241.539	You just turn it on
243.877	and you point in the direction that you want to fly.
246.511	You give it a little twist.
247.85	That's kind of the way you communicate.
253.787	And there it goes.
255.969	(Applause)
265.396	So the interaction is super simple.
267.377	It's like a personal flying pet.
269.333	It just always maintains a certain angle to you,
271.594	and if I move around with it,
273.67	it'll actually follow me naturally.
276.316	And of course, we can build on top of this.
278.455	So this leash has some additional electronics.
281.025	You can turn it on.
282.859	And now, it's like telling your dog to fly lower,
288.08	if you have such a dog. So, I can press a button
290.638	and manipulate it rather easily.
293.281	So I just shifted its position.
295.97	And it's really safe.
297.747	I don't know about you guys in the front row —
300.43	(Laughter) — but at least in principle,
302.674	you have to agree that you feel safer
304.789	because there is a physical connection.
306.837	Live demos are hard, right?
308.355	Things go wrong all the time.
309.907	But no matter what,
311.347	this thing will actually prevent this thing
313.216	from going into you.
314.882	What's more, it tells you immediately that
316.97	I am the one responsible for this device.
318.998	You don't have to look for someone controlling it.
321.518	Now, I can tell you that it's easy a lot,
324.285	but I think a really good way to prove that
327.3	is to grab a second one
330.359	and launch it.
334.364	And if I can do this on stage live,
337.647	then I can show each and every one of you
339.91	in five minutes how to 
339.91	operate one of these devices.
352.659	So now we have two eyes in the sky. (Applause)
354.666	And now the trick is getting them back.
359.746	(Laughter)
363.841	So my question now to you is,
366.255	well, it's a nice solution,
368	it's very accessible, it's safe.
370.13	What would you use it for?
371.671	What would you use such a camera for in your life?
375.42	Thank you.
377.734	(Applause)
