15.26	Humans in the developed world
17.26	spend more than 90 percent of their lives indoors,
20.26	where they breathe in and come into contact
23.26	with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye:
26.26	microorganisms.
28.26	Buildings are complex ecosystems
30.26	that are an important source
32.26	of microbes that are good for us,
34.26	and some that are bad for us.
36.26	What determines the types and distributions
39.26	of microbes indoors?
41.26	Buildings are colonized by airborne microbes
44.26	that enter through windows
46.26	and through mechanical ventilation systems.
49.26	And they are brought inside
51.26	by humans and other creatures.
54.26	The fate of microbes indoors
56.26	depends on complex interactions
58.26	with humans,
60.26	and with the human-built environment.
62.26	And today, architects and biologists
64.26	are working together
66.26	to explore smart building design
69.26	that will create
71.26	healthy buildings for us.
74.26	We spend an extraordinary amount of time
76.26	in buildings
78.26	that are extremely controlled environments,
81.26	like this building here --
83.26	environments that have mechanical ventilation systems
86.26	that include filtering,
88.26	heating and air conditioning.
90.26	Given the amount of time that we spend indoors,
92.26	it's important to understand
94.26	how this affects our health.
96.26	At the Biology and the Built Environment Center,
99.26	we carried out a study in a hospital
102.26	where we sampled air
104.26	and pulled the DNA
106.26	out of microbes in the air.
108.26	And we looked at three different types of rooms.
111.26	We looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated,
113.26	which are the data points in the blue.
115.26	We looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated,
118.26	where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation
120.26	in a wing of the building
122.26	and pry open the windows
124.26	that were no longer operable,
126.26	but they made them operable for our study.
128.26	And we also sampled the outdoor air.
130.26	If you look at the x-axis of this graph,
133.26	you'll see that what we commonly want to do --
136.26	which is keeping the outdoors out --
138.26	we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation.
141.26	So if you look at the green data points,
143.26	which is air that's outside,
145.26	you'll see that there's a large amount of microbial diversity,
148.26	or variety of microbial types.
150.26	But if you look at the blue data points,
152.26	which is mechanically ventilated air,
154.26	it's not as diverse.
157.26	But being less diverse
159.26	is not necessarily good for our health.
161.26	If you look at the y-axis of this graph,
164.26	you'll see that, in the mechanically ventilated air,
167.26	you have a higher probability
169.26	of encountering a potential pathogen,
171.26	or germ,
173.26	than if you're outdoors.
175.26	So to understand why this was the case,
178.26	we took our data
180.26	and put it into an ordination diagram,
182.26	which is a statistical map
184.26	that tells you something
186.26	about how related the microbial communities are
188.26	in the different samples.
190.26	The data points that are closer together
192.26	have microbial communities that are more similar
195.26	than data points that are far apart.
197.26	And the first things that you can see from this graph
199.26	is, if you look at the blue data points,
201.26	which are the mechanically ventilated air,
204.26	they're not simply a subset of the green data points,
207.26	which are the outdoor air.
209.26	What we've found is that mechanically ventilated air
212.26	looks like humans.
214.26	It has microbes on it
216.26	that are commonly associated with our skin
219.26	and with our mouth, our spit.
221.26	And this is because
223.26	we're all constantly shedding microbes.
225.26	So all of you right now
227.26	are sharing your microbes with one another.
229.26	And when you're outdoors,
231.26	that type of air has microbes
233.26	that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt.
236.26	Why does this matter?
238.26	It matters because the health care industry
240.26	is the second most energy intensive industry
243.26	in the United States.
245.26	Hospitals use two and a half times
247.26	the amount of energy as office buildings.
250.26	And the model that we're working with
252.26	in hospitals,
254.26	and also with many, many different buildings,
256.26	is to keep the outdoors out.
258.26	And this model
260.26	may not necessarily be the best for our health.
263.26	And given the extraordinary amount
265.26	of nosocomial infections,
267.26	or hospital-acquired infections,
270.26	this is a clue that it's a good time
272.26	to reconsider our current practices.
275.26	So just as we manage national parks,
278.26	where we promote the growth of some species
280.26	and we inhibit the growth of others,
283.26	we're working towards thinking about buildings
286.26	using an ecosystem framework
288.26	where we can promote the kinds of microbes
291.26	that we want to have indoors.
295.26	I've heard somebody say
297.26	that you're as healthy as your gut.
299.26	And for this reason, many people eat probiotic yogurt
302.26	so they can promote a healthy gut flora.
305.26	And what we ultimately want to do
307.26	is to be able to use this concept
310.26	to promote a healthy group
312.26	of microorganisms inside.
314.26	Thank you.
