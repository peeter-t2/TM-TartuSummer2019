12.621	Could I protect my father
13.993	from the Armed Islamic Group with a paring knife?
17.168	That was the question I faced
18.729	one Tuesday morning in June of 1993,
21.497	when I was a law student.
23.339	I woke up early that morning
25.277	in Dad's apartment
26.397	on the outskirts of Algiers, Algeria,
28.695	to an unrelenting pounding on the front door.
31.969	It was a season as described by a local paper
34.729	when every Tuesday a scholar fell
37.585	to the bullets of fundamentalist assassins.
40.768	My father's university teaching of Darwin
43.13	had already provoked a classroom visit
45.13	from the head of the so-called
45.13	Islamic Salvation Front,
48.601	who denounced Dad as an advocate of biologism
51.657	before Dad had ejected the man,
54.323	and now whoever was outside
55.81	would neither identify himself nor go away.
58.91	So my father tried to get the police on the phone,
61.882	but perhaps terrified by the rising tide
63.98	of armed extremism that had already claimed
66.404	the lives of so many Algerian officers,
68.937	they didn't even answer.
71.063	And that was when I went to the kitchen,
73.402	got out a paring knife,
74.777	and took up a position inside the entryway.
77.755	It was a ridiculous thing to do, really,
79.302	but I couldn't think of anything else,
81.151	and so there I stood.
83.74	When I look back now, I think
83.74	that that was the moment
86.247	that set me on the path was to writing a book
88.761	"called ""Your Fatwa Does Not Apply Here:"
91.413	Untold Stories from the Fight
91.413	"Against Muslim Fundamentalism."""
95.45	The title comes from a Pakistani play.
98.416	I think it was actually that moment
101.266	that sent me on the journey
103.01	to interview 300 people of Muslim heritage
105.96	from nearly 30 countries,
107.494	from Afghanistan to Mali,
109.91	to find out how they fought fundamentalism
112.251	peacefully like my father did,
114.479	and how they coped with the attendant risks.
118.214	Luckily, back in June of 1993,
120.431	our unidentified visitor went away,
123.263	but other families were so much less lucky,
126.308	and that was the thought
126.308	that motivated my research.
130.161	In any case, someone would return
131.691	a few months later and leave a note
133.275	on Dad's kitchen table,
134.727	"which simply said, ""Consider yourself dead."""
138.857	Subsequently, Algeria's
138.857	fundamentalist armed groups
141.845	would murder as many as 200,000 civilians
144.908	in what came to be known
146.26	as the dark decade of the 1990s,
149.138	including every single one
151.01	of the women that you see here.
154.257	In its harsh counterterrorist response,
157.13	the state resorted to torture
159.127	and to forced disappearances,
160.838	and as terrible as all of these events became,
164.2	the international community largely ignored them.
167.835	Finally, my father, an Algerian
167.835	peasant's son turned professor,
171.558	was forced to stop teaching at the university
173.661	and to flee his apartment,
175.85	but what I will never forget
177.223	about Mahfoud Bennoune, my dad,
179.458	was that like so many other Algerian intellectuals,
182.167	he refused to leave the country
183.941	and he continued to publish pointed criticisms,
186.999	both of the fundamentalists
188.949	and sometimes of the government they battled.
191.919	For example, in a November 1994 series
195.041	in the newspaper El Watan
197.195	"entitled ""How Fundamentalism"
198.704	"Produced a Terrorism without Precedent,"""
202.246	he denounced what he called
203.483	the terrorists' radical break with the true Islam
206.816	as it was lived by our ancestors.
209.684	These were words that could get you killed.
212.515	My father's country taught me
213.992	in that dark decade of the 1990s that
216.546	the popular struggle against Muslim fundamentalism
219.954	is one of the most important
221.642	and overlooked human rights struggles
224.173	in the world.
225.928	This remains true today, nearly 20 years later.
229.539	You see, in every country
231.12	where you hear about armed jihadis
232.97	targeting civilians,
234.726	there are also unarmed people
236.401	defying those militants that you don't hear about,
239.248	and those people need our support to succeed.
243.83	In the West, it's often assumed
245.648	that Muslims generally condone terrorism.
248.685	Some on the right think this because they view
250.687	Muslim culture as inherently violent,
252.95	and some on the left imagine this
254.535	because they view Muslim violence,
256.323	fundamentalist violence,
257.674	solely as a product of legitimate grievances.
261.307	But both views are dead wrong.
263.804	In fact, many people of Muslim heritage
265.619	around the world are staunch opponents
268.383	both of fundamentalism and of terrorism,
271.644	and often for very good reason.
274.11	You see, they're much more likely to be victims
276.15	of this violence than its perpetrators.
279.305	Let me just give you one example.
281.322	According to a 2009 survey
284.165	of Arabic language media resources,
286.505	between 2004 and 2008,
289.756	no more than 15 percent of al Qaeda's victims
292.88	were Westerners.
294.461	That's a terrible toll, but the vast majority
297.406	were people of Muslim heritage,
299.175	killed by Muslim fundamentalists.
301.991	Now I've been talking for the last five minutes
304.819	about fundamentalism, and you have a right to know
307.302	exactly what I mean.
308.996	I cite the definition given by the Algerian sociologist
312.901	Marieme Helie Lucas,
314.94	and she says that fundamentalisms,
317.336	"note the ""s,"" so within all of the world's"
319.834	great religious traditions,
321.656	"""fundamentalisms are political"
321.656	movements of the extreme right
325.627	which in a context of globalization
327.79	manipulate religion in order to achieve
330.284	"their political aims."""
331.933	Sadia Abbas has called this the radical politicization
335.616	of theology.
337.127	Now I want to avoid projecting the notion
339.542	that there's sort of a monolith out there
341.328	called Muslim fundamentalism
341.328	that is the same everywhere,
344.541	because these movements
344.541	also have their diversities.
347.257	Some use and advocate violence.
349.72	Some do not, though they're often interrelated.
352.35	They take different forms.
353.92	Some may be non-governmental organizations,
356.544	even here in Britain like Cageprisoners.
359.076	Some may become political parties,
361.169	like the Muslim Brotherhood,
362.74	and some may be openly armed groups
364.458	like the Taliban.
366.183	But in any case, these are all radical projects.
369.504	They're not conservative or traditional approaches.
372.733	They're most often about changing
372.733	people's relationship with Islam
375.946	rather than preserving it.
377.501	What I am talking about is the Muslim extreme right,
380.891	and the fact that its adherents are
382.89	or purport to be Muslim
384.73	makes them no less offensive
386.14	than the extreme right anywhere else.
388.631	So in my view, if we consider ourselves
390.498	liberal or left-wing,
392.248	human rights-loving or feminist,
394.708	we must oppose these movements
396.909	and support their grassroots opponents.
399.754	Now let me be clear
401.37	that I support an effective struggle
403.372	against fundamentalism,
405.317	but also a struggle that must itself
407.597	respect international law,
409.535	so nothing I am saying should be taken
411.964	as a justification for refusals
413.809	to democratize,
415.274	and here I send out a shout-out of support
417.949	to the pro-democracy movement 
417.949	in Algeria today, Barakat.
422	Nor should anything I say be taken
424.282	as a justification of violations of human rights,
427.149	like the mass death sentences
428.555	handed out in Egypt earlier this week.
431.475	But what I am saying
432.998	is that we must challenge these
432.998	Muslim fundamentalist movements
436.305	because they threaten human rights
438.123	across Muslim-majority contexts,
440.706	and they do this in a range of ways,
443.087	most obviously with the direct attacks on civilians
446.05	by the armed groups that carry those out.
448.289	But that violence is just the tip of the iceberg.
451.336	These movements as a whole purvey discrimination
454.127	against religious minorities and sexual minorities.
457.448	They seek to curtail the freedom of religion
459.528	of everyone who either practices in a different way
462.427	or chooses not to practice.
464.391	And most definingly, they lead an all-out war
467.815	on the rights of women.
469.896	Now, faced with these movements
471.692	in recent years, Western discourse
473.264	has most often offered
474.899	two flawed responses.
477.156	The first that one sometimes finds on the right
479.719	suggests that most Muslims are fundamentalist
482.261	or something about Islam is
482.261	inherently fundamentalist,
485.607	and this is just offensive and wrong,
488.898	but unfortunately on the left
488.898	one sometimes encounters
491.306	a discourse that is too politically correct
493.488	to acknowledge the problem of
493.488	Muslim fundamentalism at all
497.29	or, even worse, apologizes for it,
499.651	and this is unacceptable as well.
502.199	So what I'm seeking is a new way
504.261	of talking about this all together,
506.382	which is grounded in the lived experiences
509.11	and the hope of the people on the front lines.
512.059	I'm painfully aware that there has been
514.01	an increase in discrimination
514.01	against Muslims in recent years
517.191	in countries like the U.K. and the U.S.,
519.662	and that too is a matter of grave concern,
522.716	but I firmly believe
523.855	that telling these counter-stereotypical stories
526.816	of people of Muslim heritage
528.142	who have confronted the fundamentalists
530.314	and been their primary victims
532.329	is also a great way of countering that discrimination.
536.906	So now let me introduce you
538.686	to four people whose stories
540.342	I had the great honor of telling.
543.558	Faizan Peerzada and the Rafi Peer Theatre
545.791	workshop named for his father
547.793	have for years promoted the performing arts
549.931	in Pakistan.
551.663	With the rise of jihadist violence,
553.124	they began to receive threats
554.7	to call off their events, which they refused to heed.
557.95	And so a bomber struck their 2008
561.22	eighth world performing arts festival in Lahore,
564.104	producing rain of glass
565.792	that fell into the venue
567.457	injuring nine people,
569.392	and later that same night,
570.96	the Peerzadas made a very difficult decision:
573.711	they announced that their festival
575.58	would continue as planned the next day.
578.987	As Faizan said at the time,
580.438	if we bow down to the Islamists,
582.38	we'll just be sitting in a dark corner.
585.491	But they didn't know what would happen.
587.149	Would anyone come?
589.586	In fact, thousands of people came out the next day
592.475	to support the performing arts in Lahore,
594.877	and this simultaneously thrilled
596.722	and terrified Faizan,
598.544	and he ran up to a woman
599.997	who had come in with her two small children,
602.214	"and he said, ""You do know there"
602.214	was a bomb here yesterday,
605.408	"and you do know there's a threat here today."""
607.735	"And she said, ""I know that,"
609.618	but I came to your festival
611.182	with my mother when I was their age,
613.612	and I still have those images in my mind.
616.66	"We have to be here."""
618.798	With stalwart audiences like this,
620.655	the Peerzadas were able to conclude
622.309	their festival on schedule.
624.769	And then the next year,
626.006	they lost all of their sponsors
627.889	due to the security risk.
630.258	So when I met them in 2010,
632.558	they were in the middle of the first subsequent event
634.844	that they were able to have in the same venue,
637.91	and this was the ninth youth performing arts festival
641.174	held in Lahore in a year when that city
644.149	had already experienced 44 terror attacks.
648.219	This was a time when the Pakistani Taliban
650.322	had commenced their systematic targeting
652.139	of girls' schools that would culminate
654.347	in the attack on Malala Yousafzai.
657.106	What did the Peerzadas do in that environment?
661.501	They staged girls' school theater.
664.674	"So I had the privilege of watching ""Naang Wal,"""
667.486	which was a musical in the Punjabi language,
670.118	and the girls of Lahore Grammar School
671.88	played all the parts.
673.606	They sang and danced,
674.84	they played the mice and the water buffalo,
677.498	and I held my breath, wondering,
679.962	would we get to the end
681.229	of this amazing show?
683.515	And when we did, the whole audience
686.071	collectively exhaled,
687.809	and a few people actually wept,
690.073	and then they filled the auditorium
692.596	with the peaceful boom of their applause.
695.435	And I remember thinking in that moment
698.422	that the bombers made headlines here
700.853	two years before
702.516	but this night and these people
704.88	are as important a story.
710.488	Maria Bashir is the first and only
712.968	woman chief prosecutor in Afghanistan.
716.092	She's been in the post since 2008
718.306	and actually opened an office to investigate
720.492	cases of violence against women,
722.318	which she says is the most important area
724.576	in her mandate.
726.31	When I meet her in her office in Herat,
729.375	she enters surrounded by
731.12	four large men with four huge guns.
734.486	In fact, she now has 23 bodyguards,
737.45	because she has weathered bomb attacks
738.87	that nearly killed her kids,
740.548	and it took the leg off of one of her guards.
743.899	Why does she continue?
746.009	She says with a smile that that is the question
748.663	that everyone asks—
750.71	"as she puts it, ""Why you risk not living?"""
754.535	And it is simply that for her,
756.174	a better future for all the Maria Bashirs to come
759.643	is worth the risk,
761.127	and she knows that if people like her
762.837	do not take the risk,
764.752	there will be no better future.
767.049	Later on in our interview,
768.776	Prosecutor Bashir tells me how worried she is
771.139	about the possible outcome
772.658	of government negotiations with the Taliban,
775.157	the people who have been trying to kill her.
777.551	"""If we give them a place in the government,"""
779.303	"she asks, ""Who will protect women's rights?"""
782.52	And she urges the international community
784.886	not to forget its promise about women
787.518	because now they want peace with Taliban.
791.345	A few weeks after I leave Afghanistan,
793.55	I see a headline on the Internet.
796.425	An Afghan prosecutor has been assassinated.
800.03	I google desperately,
802.166	and thankfully that day I find out
803.84	that Maria was not the victim,
805.926	though sadly, another Afghan prosecutor
808.149	was gunned down on his way to work.
810.18	And when I hear headlines like that now,
813.175	I think that as international troops
815.473	leave Afghanistan this year and beyond,
818.521	we must continue to care
820.427	about what happens to people there,
821.86	to all of the Maria Bashirs.
824.886	Sometimes I still hear her voice in my head
827.499	saying, with no bravado whatsoever,
830.58	"""The situation of the women of Afghanistan"
833.185	will be better someday.
835.091	We should prepare the ground for this,
837.326	"even if we are killed."""
841.854	There are no words adequate
843.502	to denounce the al Shabaab terrorists
845.478	who attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi
847.74	on the same day as a children's cooking competition
851.202	in September of 2013.
853.62	They killed 67, including poets and pregnant women.
858.119	Far away in the American Midwest,
860.218	I had the good fortune of meeting Somali-Americans
862.565	who were working to counter
862.565	the efforts of al Shabaab
865.413	to recruit a small number of young people
867.637	from their city of Minneapolis
869.581	to take part in atrocities like Westgate.
873.279	Abdirizak Bihi's studious
878.128	was recruited here in 2008,
880.776	spirited to Somalia,
882.536	and then killed when he tried to come home.
885.906	Since that time, Mr. Bihi,
887.5	who directs the no-budget Somali
887.5	Education and Advocacy Center,
891.753	has been vocally denouncing the recruitment
894.204	and the failures of government
896.06	and Somali-American institutions
898.279	like the Abubakar As-Saddique Islamic Center
901.304	where he believes his nephew was radicalized
903.535	during a youth program.
905.641	But he doesn't just criticize the mosque.
907.794	He also takes on the government
909.373	for its failure to do more
911.158	to prevent poverty in his community.
913.656	Given his own lack of financial resources,
915.945	Mr. Bihi has had to be creative.
918.256	To counter the efforts of al Shabaab
920.15	to sway more disaffected youth,
922.535	in the wake of the group's 2010 attack
924.97	on World Cup viewers in Uganda,
927.564	he organized a Ramadan basketball tournament
930.904	in Minneapolis in response.
933.436	Scores of Somali-American kids came out
936.12	to embrace sport
937.508	despite the fatwa against it.
940	They played basketball
941.745	as Burhan Hassan never would again.
945.612	For his efforts, Mr. Bihi has been ostracized
948.262	by the leadership of the Abubakar
948.262	As-Saddique Islamic Center,
951.334	with which he used to have good relations.
953.899	"He told me, ""One day we saw the imam on TV"
956.285	calling us infidels and saying,
958.343	"'These families are trying to destroy the mosque.'"""
961.912	This is at complete odds
963.323	with how Abdirizak Bihi understands
965.856	what he is trying to do
967.656	by exposing al Shabaab recruitment,
970.062	which is to save the religion I love
972.484	from a small number of extremists.
976.938	Now I want to tell one last story,
979.499	that of a 22-year-old law student in Algeria
982.513	named Amel Zenoune-Zouani
984.459	who had the same dreams of a legal career
986.338	that I did back in the '90s.
989.04	She refused to give up her studies,
990.969	despite the fact that the fundamentalists
992.938	battling the Algerian state back then
995.468	threatened all who continued their education.
999.09	On January 26, 1997, Amel boarded the bus
1003.2	in Algiers where she was studying
1005.122	to go home and spend a Ramadan evening
1007.305	with her family,
1008.994	and would never finish law school.
1011.38	When the bus reached the outskirts
1012.84	of her hometown, it was stopped
1014.615	at a checkpoint manned by men
1016.757	from the Armed Islamic Group.
1019.051	Carrying her schoolbag,
1020.78	Amel was taken off the bus
1022.766	and killed in the street.
1025.355	The men who cut her throat
1026.491	then told everyone else,
1028.341	"""If you go to university,"
1030.235	the day will come when we will kill all of you
1032.789	"just like this."""
1036.02	Amel died at exactly 5:17 p.m.,
1038.72	which we know because when she fell in the street,
1041.568	her watch broke.
1043.345	Her mother showed me the watch
1044.574	with the second hand still aimed
1046.575	optimistically upward
1048.071	towards a 5:18 that would never come.
1051.507	Shortly before her death,
1052.656	Amel had said to her mother of herself
1054.511	and her sisters,
1056.398	"""Nothing will happen to us, Inshallah, God willing,"
1060.015	but if something happens,
1061.885	you must know that we are dead for knowledge.
1064.768	"You and father must keep your heads held high."""
1068.978	The loss of such a young woman is unfathomable,
1072.96	and so as I did my research
1074.515	I found myself searching for Amel's hope again
1077.769	"and her name even means ""hope"" in Arabic."
1080.706	I think I found it in two places.
1083.957	The first is in the strength of her family
1086.252	and all the other families to
1086.252	continue telling their stories
1089.518	and to go on with their lives despite the terrorism.
1092.583	In fact, Amel's sister Lamia overcame her grief,
1095.865	went to law school,
1097.236	and practices as a lawyer in Algiers today,
1099.99	something which is only possible
1101.591	because the armed fundamentalists
1102.78	were largely defeated in the country.
1105.658	And the second place I found Amel's hope
1108.505	was everywhere that women and men
1110.977	continue to defy the jihadis.
1113.672	We must support all of those in honor of Amel
1116.93	who continue this human rights struggle today,
1119.563	like the Network of Women
1119.563	Living Under Muslim Laws.
1123.56	It is not enough, as the victims rights advocate
1126.187	Cherifa Kheddar told me in Algiers,
1128.074	it is not enough just to battle terrorism.
1131.139	We must also challenge fundamentalism,
1133.683	because fundamentalism is the ideology
1136.12	that makes the bed of this terrorism.
1138.711	Why is it that people like her, like all of them
1142.15	are not more well known?
1143.844	Why is it that everyone knows
1143.844	who Osama bin Laden was
1147.121	and so few know of all of those
1149.054	standing up to the bin Ladens in their own contexts.
1152.747	We must change that, and so I ask you
1155.404	to please help share these stories
1157.172	through your networks.
1158.945	Look again at Amel Zenoune's watch,
1161.044	forever frozen,
1162.704	and now please look at your own watch
1165.066	and decide this is the moment that you commit
1168.09	to supporting people like Amel.
1169.998	We don't have the right to be silent about them
1172.379	because it is easier
1173.877	or because Western policy is flawed as well,
1176.738	because 5:17 is still coming
1179.074	to too many Amel Zenounes
1180.941	in places like northern Nigeria,
1182.911	where jihadis still kill students.
1185.487	The time to speak up in support of all of those
1188.568	who peacefully challenge fundamentalism
1190.876	and terrorism in their own communities
1193.84	is now.
1195.376	Thank you.
1197.659	(Applause)
