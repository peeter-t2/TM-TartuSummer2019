15.911	It was a Saturday afternoon in May,
19.09	and I suddenly realized
21.604	that the next day was Mother's Day,
25.058	and I hadn't gotten anything for my mom,
26.904	so I started thinking about
28.305	what should I get my mom for Mother's Day?
30.642	I thought, why don't I make her
32.486	an interactive Mother's Day card
35.535	using the Scratch software that I'd been developing
38.243	with my research group at the MIT Media Lab?
42.06	We developed it so that people could easily create
45.44	their own interactive stories and games and animations,
49.684	and then share their creations with one another.
53.453	So I thought, this would be an opportunity to use Scratch
57.321	to make an interactive card for my mom.
60.221	Before making my own Mother's Day card,
62.397	I thought I would take a look
64.382	at the Scratch website.
65.955	So over the last several years, kids around the world
69.313	ages 8 and up, have shared their projects,
72.507	and I thought, I wonder if, of those three million projects,
75.942	whether anyone else has thought to put up Mother's Day cards.
79.327	So in the search box I typed in
82.321	"""Mother's Day,"""
83.866	and I was surprised and delighted to see a list
86.869	of dozens and dozens of Mother's Day cards
89.573	that showed up on the Scratch website,
92.087	many of them just in the past 24 hours
94.405	by procrastinators just like myself.
97.611	So I started taking a look at them. (Music)
100.733	I saw one of them that featured a kitten
103.189	and her mom and wishing her mom a happy Mother's Day.
110.06	And the creator very considerately
112.591	offered a replay for her mom.
116.095	Another one was an interactive project where,
118.479	"when you moved the mouse over the letters of ""Happy Mom Day,"""
121.677	it reveals a special happy Mother's Day slogan.
126.597	(Music) In this one, the creator told a narrative
130.58	about how she had Googled to find out
133.239	when Mother's Day was happening.
136.356	(Typing) And then once she found out when Mother's Day was happening,
140.499	she delivered a special Mother's Day greeting
142.977	of how much she loved her mom.
146.604	So I really enjoyed looking at these projects
148.829	and interacting with these projects.
150.481	In fact, I liked it so much that, instead of making my own project,
154.322	I sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects. (Laughter)
159.076	And actually, she reacted exactly the way that I hoped that she would.
162.656	She wrote back to me and she said,
164.041	"""I'm so proud to have a son that created the software"
167.308	"that allowed these kids to make Mother's Day cards for their mothers."""
171.42	So my mom was happy, and that made me happy,
175.22	but actually I was even happier for another reason.
179.844	I was happy because these kids were using Scratch
183.803	just in the way that we had hoped that they would.
186.604	As they created their interactive Mother's Day cards,
189.415	you could see that they were really
191.696	becoming fluent with new technologies.
195.008	What do I mean by fluent?
196.471	I mean that they were able to start expressing themselves
200.503	and to start expressing their ideas.
203.28	When you become fluent with language,
205.934	it means you can write an entry in your journal
209.471	or tell a joke to someone or write a letter to a friend.
213.524	And it's similar with new technologies.
216.681	By writing, be creating these interactive Mother's Day cards,
220.863	these kids were showing that they were really fluent
223.393	with new technologies.
225.066	Now maybe you won't be so surprised by this,
227.831	because a lot of times people feel that
230.527	young people today can do all sorts of things with technology.
233.927	"I mean, all of us have heard young people referred to as ""digital natives."""
238.388	But actually I'm sort of skeptical about this term.
242.185	I'm not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives.
245.686	When you really look at it, how is it that young people
248.239	spend most of their time using new technologies?
251.775	You often see them in situations like this,
255.298	or like this,
257.492	and there's no doubt that young people
259.01	are very comfortable and familiar browsing
262.326	and chatting and texting and gaming.
266.848	But that doesn't really make you fluent.
270.047	So young people today have lots of experience
274.006	and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies,
277.801	but a lot less so of creating with new technologies
281.206	and expressing themselves with new technologies.
284.178	It's almost as if they can read
286.57	but not write with new technologies.
289.903	And I'm really interested in seeing, how can we help young people become fluent
293.801	so they can write with new technologies?
296.33	And that really means that they need to be able to
299.69	write their own computer programs, or code.
304.202	So, increasingly, people are starting to recognize
306.914	the importance of learning to code.
310.218	You know, in recent years, there have been
312.82	hundreds of new organizations and websites
315.712	that are helping young people learn to code.
319.006	You look online, you'll see places like Codecademy
322.597	and events like CoderDojo
324.968	and sites like Girls Who Code,
327.399	or Black Girls Code.
329.093	It seems that everybody is getting into the act.
332.201	You know, just at the beginning of this year,
334.784	at the turn of the new year,
336.149	New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg
338.809	made a New Year's resolution that he was going to learn
341.069	to code in 2012.
343.848	A few months later, the country of Estonia decided that
347.016	all of its first graders should learn to code.
350.672	And that triggered a debate in the U.K.
353.464	about whether all the children there should learn to code.
357.773	Now, for some of you, when you hear about this,
360.616	it might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code.
364.224	When many people think of coding, they think of it
367.374	as something that only a very narrow sub-community
370.95	of people are going to be doing,
373.608	and they think of coding looking like this.
376.53	And in fact, if this is what coding is like,
378.696	it will only be a narrow sub-community of people
381.191	with special mathematical skills and technological background
384.263	that can code.
386.529	But coding doesn't have to be like this.
389.029	Let me show you about what it's like to code in Scratch.
393.008	So in Scratch, to code, you just snap blocks together.
397.287	In this case, you take a move block,
399.202	snap it into a stack,
400.971	and the stacks of blocks control the behaviors
403.729	of the different characters in your game or your story,
407.247	in this case controlling the big fish.
409.548	"After you've created your program, you can click on ""share,"""
412.999	and then share your project with other people,
416.075	so that they can use the project
417.898	and start working on the project as well.
420.872	So, of course, making a fish game isn't the only thing
424.194	you can do with Scratch.
425.839	Of the millions of projects on the Scratch website,
427.819	there's everything from animated stories
430.643	to school science projects
433.059	to anime soap operas
435.123	to virtual construction kits
437.445	to recreations of classic video games
440.158	to political opinion polls
442.427	to trigonometry tutorials
445.067	to interactive artwork, and, yes,
447.987	interactive Mother's Day cards.
450.771	So I think there's so many different ways
453.807	that people can express themselves using this,
457.267	to be able to take their ideas and share their ideas with the world.
460.667	And it doesn't just stay on the screen.
463.229	You can also code to interact with the physical world around you.
466.996	Here's an example from Hong Kong,
469.475	where some kids made a game
470.882	and then built their own physical interface device
474.163	and had a light sensor, so the light sensor
477.055	detects the hole in the board,
478.998	so as they move the physical saw,
481.198	the light sensor detects the hole
483.438	and controls the virtual saw on the screen
486.394	and saws down the tree.
489.174	We're going to continue to look at new ways
491.283	of bringing together the physical world and the virtual world
494.339	and connecting to the world around us.
497.267	This is an example from a new version of Scratch
499.5	that we'll be releasing in the next few months,
503.123	and we're looking again to be able
505.173	to push you in new directions.
506.869	Here's an example.
509.133	It uses the webcam.
513.207	And as I move my hand, I can pop the balloons
518.063	or I can move the bug.
520.948	So it's a little bit like Microsoft Kinect,
523.513	where you interact with gestures in the world.
526.229	But instead of just playing someone else's game,
528.473	you get to create the games,
530.715	and if you see someone else's game,
532.098	"you can just say ""see inside,"""
534.738	and you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it.
537.632	So there's a new block that says how much video motion there is,
541.187	and then, if there's so much video motion,
544.308	it will then tell the balloon to pop.
547.687	The same way that this uses the camera
550.071	to get information into Scratch,
552.576	you can also use the microphone.
555.583	Here's an example of a project using the microphone.
559.567	So I'm going to let all of you control this game
561.967	using your voices.
564.213	(Crickets chirping) (Shouts) (Chomping)
580.669	(Laughter)
589.298	(Applause)
598.082	As kids are creating projects like this,
600.687	they're learning to code,
602.952	but even more importantly, they're coding to learn.
606.886	Because as they learn to code,
609.175	it enables them to learn many other things,
612.495	opens up many new opportunities for learning.
615.367	Again, it's useful to make an analogy to reading and writing.
619.751	When you learn to read and write, it opens up
622.691	opportunities for you to learn so many other things.
625.751	When you learn to read, you can then read to learn.
629.511	And it's the same thing with coding.
631.699	If you learn to code, you can code to learn.
634.246	Now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious.
636.8	You learn more about how computers work.
639.298	But that's just where it starts.
641.616	When you learn to code, it opens up for you to learn
644.211	many other things.
646.456	Let me show you an example.
648.802	Here's another project,
651.072	and I saw this when I was visiting
653.34	one of the computer clubhouses.
655.482	These are after-school learning centers that we helped start
658.502	that help young people from low-income communities
661.264	learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies.
665.343	And when I went to one of the clubhouses a couple years ago,
668.138	I saw a 13-year-old boy who was using our Scratch software
671.863	to create a game somewhat like this one,
674.759	and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game,
677.682	but also he wanted to do more.
680.647	He wanted to keep score.
682.951	So this was a game where the big fish eats the little fish,
686.027	but he wanted to keep score, so that each time
688.954	the big fish eats the little fish,
692.332	the score would go up and it would keep track,
694.871	and he didn't know how to do that.
697.383	So I showed him.
699.648	In Scratch, you can create something called a variable.
703.225	I'll call it score.
707.352	And that creates some new blocks for you,
710.183	and also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score,
714.849	"so each time I click on ""change score,"" it increments the score."
720.101	So I showed this to the clubhouse member --
722.626	let's call him Victor -- and Victor,
725.327	when he saw that this block would let him increment the score,
728.129	he knew exactly what to do.
729.945	He took the block
732.259	and he put it into the program
735.303	exactly where the big fish eats the little fish.
739.496	So then, each time the big fish eats the little fish,
744.519	he will increment the score, and the score will go up by one.
750.514	And it's in fact working.
752.211	And he saw this, and he was so excited,
754.465	he reached his hand out to me,
756.144	"and he said, ""Thank you, thank you, thank you."""
758.693	And what went through my mind was,
760.762	how often is it that teachers are thanked by their students
763.804	for teaching them variables? (Laughter)
767.207	It doesn't happen in most classrooms,
769.688	but that's because in most classrooms, when kids learn about variables,
772.647	they don't know why they're learning it.
775.155	It's nothing that, really, they can make use of.
778.026	When you learn ideas like this in Scratch,
780.188	you can learn it in a way that's really meaningful and motivating for you,
784.291	that you can understand the reason for learning variables,
787.281	and we see that kids learn it more deeply
789.323	and learn it better.
790.738	Victor had, I'm sure, been taught about variables in schools,
793.779	but he really didn't -- he wasn't paying attention.
795.967	Now he had a reason for learning variables.
798.25	So when you learn through coding, and coding to learn,
801.324	you're learning it in a meaningful context, and that's the best way of learning things.
806.208	So as kids like Victor are creating projects like this,
809.663	they're learning important concepts like variables,
812.447	but that's just the start.
814.575	As Victor worked on this project and created the scripts,
818.425	he was also learning about the process of design,
821.677	how to start with the glimmer of an idea
824.296	and turn it into a fully-fledged, functioning project
827.202	like you see here.
829.709	So he was learning many different core principles of design,
833.749	about how to experiment with new ideas,
836.991	how to take complex ideas and break them down into simpler parts,
841.696	how to collaborate with other people on your projects,
844.686	about how to find and fix bugs when things go wrong,
848.137	how to keep persistent and to persevere
851.191	in the face of frustrations when things aren't working well.
854.596	Now those are important skills
856.369	that aren't just relevant for coding.
859.237	They're relevant for all sorts of different activities.
862.064	Now, who knows if Victor is going to grow up and become
865.232	a programmer or a professional computer scientist?
868.156	It's probably not so likely,
869.968	but regardless of what he does,
871.756	he'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned.
875.46	Regardless of whether he grows up to be a marketing manager
878.044	or a mechanic or a community organizer,
881.164	that these ideas are useful for everybody.
883.62	Again, it's useful to think about this analogy with language.
887.542	When you become fluent with reading and writing,
891.898	it's not something that you're doing
894.339	just to become a professional writer.
896.299	Very few people become professional writers.
898.996	But it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write.
902.564	Again, the same thing with coding.
904.659	Most people won't grow up to become professional
906.881	computer scientists or programmers,
910.1	but those skills of thinking creatively,
912.438	reasoning systematically, working collaboratively --
914.952	skills you develop when you code in Scratch --
917.662	are things that people can use no matter what they're doing in their work lives.
922.484	And it's not just about your work life.
924.86	Coding can also enable you to
927.58	express your ideas and feelings in your personal life.
930.756	Let me end with just one more example.
933.429	So this is an example that came from
936.556	after I had sent the Mother's Day cards to my mom,
941.024	she decided that she wanted to learn Scratch.
944.125	So she made this project for my birthday
947.156	and sent me a happy birthday Scratch card.
950.732	Now this project is not going to win any prizes for design,
954.588	and you can rest assured that my 83-year-old mom
957.563	is not training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist.
961.8	But working on this project enabled her
964.772	to make a connection to someone that she cares about
967.438	and enabled her to keep on learning new things
970.246	and continuing to practice her creativity
972.678	and developing new ways of expressing herself.
975.853	So as we take a look and we see that
980.064	Michael Bloomberg is learning to code,
982.628	all of the children of Estonia learn to code,
985.278	even my mom has learned to code,
987.478	don't you think it's about time that you might be
989.25	thinking about learning to code?
991.162	If you're interested in giving it a try,
993.355	I'd encourage you to go to the Scratch website.
995.791	It's scratch.mit.edu,
997.816	and give a try at coding.
999.638	Thanks very much. (Applause)
