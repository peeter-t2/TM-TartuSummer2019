15.895	It is a dream of mankind
15.895	to fly like a bird.
20.166	Birds are very agile.
22.26	They fly, not with rotating components,
25.618	so they fly only by flapping their wings.
29.023	So we looked at the birds,
31.26	and we tried to make a model
31.26	that is powerful, ultralight,
37.627	and it must have excellent
37.627	aerodynamic qualities
41.665	that would fly by its own
41.665	and only by flapping its wings.
46.4	So what would be better than to use
46.4	the herring gull, in its freedom,
51.26	circling and swooping over the sea,
53.598	and to use this as a role model?
56.937	So we bring a team together.
58.921	There are generalists and also specialists
58.921	in the field of aerodynamics,
64.025	in the field of building gliders.
66.589	And the task was to build
66.589	an ultralight indoor-flying model
71.986	that is able to fly over your heads.
75.187	So be careful later on.
77.745	(Laughter)
80.077	And this was one issue:
81.545	to build it that lightweight
83.261	that no one would be hurt if it fell down.
88.648	So why do we do all this?
90.624	We are a company
90.624	in the field of automation,
93.571	and we'd like to do
93.571	very lightweight structures
96.26	because that's energy efficient,
99.023	and we'd like to learn more
99.023	about pneumatics and air flow phenomena.
105.111	So I now would like you
105.111	to put your seat belts on
109.562	and put your hats on.
111.799	So maybe we'll try it once --
114.899	to fly a SmartBird.
116.403	Thank you.
117.455	(Applause)
133.888	(Cheers)
135.158	(Applause)
149.328	(Applause ends)
171.268	(Applause)
187.705	So we can now look at the SmartBird.
193.084	So here is one without a skin.
195.59	We have a wingspan of about two meters.
198.825	The length is one meter and six,
201.26	and the weight is only 450 grams.
206.053	And it is all out of carbon fiber.
209.26	In the middle we have a motor,
211.743	and we also have a gear in it,
215.26	and we use the gear
215.26	to transfer the circulation of the motor.
220.899	So within the motor,
220.899	we have three Hall sensors,
224.109	so we know exactly where the wing is.
229.71	And if we now beat up and down --
232.735	(Mechanical sounds)
236.696	We have the possibility
236.696	to fly like a bird.
240.783	So if you go down, you have
240.783	the large area of propulsion,
244.425	and if you go up,
247.536	the wings are not that large,
250.26	and it is easier to get up.
255.129	So, the next thing we did,
258.2	or the challenges we did,
259.997	was to coordinate this movement.
263.037	We have to turn it, go up and go down.
266.25	We have a split wing.
267.81	With the split wing,
269.26	we get the lift at the upper wing,
272.26	and we get the propulsion
272.26	at the lower wing.
275.498	Also, we see how we measure
275.498	the aerodynamic efficiency.
280.74	We had knowledge
280.74	about the electromechanical efficiency
284.994	and then we can calculate
284.994	the aerodynamic efficiency.
288.976	So therefore, it rises up
288.976	from passive torsion to active torsion,
294.32	from 30 percent up to 80 percent.
297.581	Next thing we have to do,
299.464	we have to control and regulate
299.464	the whole structure.
303.589	Only if you control and regulate it,
306.184	you will get that aerodynamic efficiency.
309.501	So the overall consumption of energy
312.612	is about 25 watts at takeoff
315.84	and 16 to 18 watts in flight.
319.396	Thank you.
320.429	(Applause)
327.034	Bruno Giussani: Markus,
327.034	we should fly it once more.
329.606	Markus Fischer: Yeah, sure.
331.035	(Audience) Yeah!
332.127	(Laughter)
353.383	(Gasps)
362.069	(Cheers)
363.887	(Applause)
