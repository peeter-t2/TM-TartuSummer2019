15.26	Thank you.
17.26	It's a real pleasure to be here.
19.26	I last did a TED Talk
21.26	I think about seven years ago or so.
25.26	I talked about spaghetti sauce.
28.26	And so many people,
28.26	I guess, watch those videos.
31.26	People have been
31.26	coming up to me ever since
33.26	to ask me questions about spaghetti sauce,
35.26	which is a wonderful thing
35.26	in the short term --
38.26	(Laughter)
40.26	but it's proven to be less than ideal
42.26	over seven years.
44.26	And so I though I would come
46.26	and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me.
49.26	(Laughter)
51.26	The theme of this morning's
51.26	session is Things We Make.
54.26	And so I thought I would tell a story
56.26	about someone
58.26	who made one of the most precious objects
60.26	of his era.
62.26	And the man's name is Carl Norden.
65.26	Carl Norden was born in 1880.
67.26	And he was Swiss.
69.26	And of course, the Swiss can be divided
71.26	into two general categories:
73.26	those who make small, exquisite,
75.26	expensive objects
77.26	and those who handle the money
79.26	of those who buy small, exquisite,
82.26	expensive objects.
84.26	And Carl Norden is very
84.26	firmly in the former camp.
87.26	He's an engineer.
89.26	He goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich.
92.26	In fact, one of his classmates
92.26	is a young man named Lenin
95.26	who would go on
97.26	to break small, expensive,
97.26	exquisite objects.
101.26	And he's a Swiss engineer, Carl.
104.26	And I mean that in its
104.26	fullest sense of the word.
107.26	He wears three-piece suits;
109.26	and he has a very, very small,
109.26	important mustache;
114.26	and he is domineering
116.26	and narcissistic
118.26	and driven
120.26	and has an extraordinary ego;
122.26	and he works 16-hour days;
125.26	and he has very strong feelings
125.26	about alternating current;
128.26	and he feels like a suntan
128.26	is a sign of moral weakness;
132.26	and he drinks lots of coffee;
134.26	and he does his best work
136.26	sitting in his mother's kitchen
136.26	in Zurich for hours
138.26	in complete silence
140.26	with nothing but a slide rule.
142.26	In any case,
144.26	Carl Norden emigrates
144.26	to the United States
147.26	just before the First World War
149.26	and sets up shop on Lafayette Street
151.26	in downtown Manhattan.
153.26	And he becomes obsessed with the question
155.26	of how to drop bombs from an airplane.
158.26	Now if you think about it,
160.26	in the age before GPS and radar,
163.26	that was obviously
163.26	a really difficult problem.
165.26	It's a complicated physics problem.
167.26	You've got a plane that's
167.26	thousands of feet up in the air,
170.26	going at hundreds of miles an hour,
172.26	and you're trying to drop
172.26	an object, a bomb,
175.26	towards some stationary target
177.26	in the face of all kinds
177.26	of winds and cloud cover
180.26	and all kinds of other impediments.
182.26	And all sorts of people,
184.26	moving up to the First World War
184.26	and between the wars,
186.26	tried to solve this problem,
188.26	and nearly everybody came up short.
190.26	The bombsights that were available
192.26	were incredibly crude.
194.26	But Carl Norden is really
194.26	the one who cracks the code.
197.26	And he comes up with this
197.26	incredibly complicated device.
200.26	It weighs about 50 lbs.
202.26	It's called the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.
206.26	And it has all kinds of levers
206.26	and ball-bearings
208.26	and gadgets and gauges.
211.26	And he makes this complicated thing.
214.26	And what he allows people to do
216.26	is he makes the bombardier
216.26	take this particular object,
220.26	visually sight the target,
222.26	because they're in the Plexiglas
222.26	cone of the bomber,
226.26	and then they plug in
226.26	the altitude of the plane,
229.26	the speed of the plane,
229.26	the speed of the wind
232.26	and the coordinates
234.26	of the target.
236.26	And the bombsight will tell him
236.26	when to drop the bomb.
240.26	And as Norden famously says,
243.26	"""Before that bombsight came along,"
245.26	bombs would routinely miss their target
247.26	"by a mile or more."""
249.26	But he said, with the
249.26	Mark 15 Norden bombsight,
252.26	he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel
254.26	at 20,000 ft.
256.26	Now I cannot tell you
258.26	how incredibly excited
260.26	the U.S. military was
262.26	by the news of the Norden bombsight.
265.26	It was like manna from heaven.
267.26	Here was an army
269.26	that had just had experience
269.26	in the First World War,
271.26	where millions of men
273.26	fought each other in the trenches,
275.26	getting nowhere, making no progress,
277.26	and here someone had come up with a device
281.26	that allowed them to fly up in the skies
283.26	high above enemy territory
285.26	and destroy whatever they wanted
287.26	with pinpoint accuracy.
289.26	And the U.S. military
291.26	spends 1.5 billion dollars --
293.26	billion dollars in 1940 dollars --
296.26	developing the Norden bombsight.
298.26	And to put that in perspective,
301.26	the total cost of the Manhattan project
303.26	was three billion dollars.
305.26	Half as much money was spent
305.26	on this Norden bombsight
308.26	as was spent on the most famous
308.26	military-industrial project
312.26	of the modern era.
314.26	And there were people, strategists,
314.26	within the U.S. military
317.26	who genuinely thought
317.26	that this single device
319.26	was going to spell the difference
321.26	between defeat and victory
323.26	when it came to the
323.26	battle against the Nazis
325.26	and against the Japanese.
327.26	And for Norden as well,
329.26	this device had incredible
329.26	moral importance,
332.26	because Norden was a committed Christian.
334.26	In fact, he would always get upset
336.26	when people referred to the
336.26	bombsight as his invention,
339.26	because in his eyes,
341.26	only God could invent things.
343.26	He was simply
343.26	the instrument of God's will.
345.26	And what was God's will?
347.26	Well God's will was that
347.26	the amount of suffering in any kind of war
350.26	be reduced to as small
350.26	an amount as possible.
353.26	And what did the Norden bombsight do?
355.26	Well it allowed you to do that.
357.26	It allowed you to bomb only those things
359.26	that you absolutely needed
359.26	and wanted to bomb.
363.26	So in the years leading up to
363.26	the Second World War,
366.26	the U.S. military buys 90,000
369.26	of these Norden bombsights
371.26	at a cost of $14,000 each --
373.26	again, in 1940 dollars,
373.26	that's a lot of money.
376.26	And they trained 50,000 bombardiers
376.26	on how to use them --
379.26	long extensive, months-long
379.26	training sessions --
383.26	because these things are
383.26	essentially analog computers;
385.26	they're not easy to use.
387.26	And they make every one
387.26	of those bombardiers take an oath,
390.26	to swear that if they're ever captured,
393.26	they will not divulge a single detail
395.26	of this particular device to the enemy,
397.26	because it's imperative
397.26	the enemy not get their hands
400.26	on this absolutely essential
400.26	piece of technology.
402.26	And whenever the Norden bombsight
402.26	is taken onto a plane,
405.26	it's escorted there by
405.26	a series of armed guards.
408.26	And it's carried in a box
408.26	with a canvas shroud over it.
411.26	And the box is handcuffed
411.26	to one of the guards.
414.26	It's never allowed to be photographed.
416.26	And there's a little
416.26	incendiary device inside of it,
419.26	so that, if the plane ever crashes,
419.26	it will be destroyed
422.26	and there's no way the enemy
422.26	can ever get their hands on it.
425.26	The Norden bombsight
427.26	is the Holy Grail.
430.26	So what happens during
430.26	the Second World War?
433.26	Well, it turns out
433.26	it's not the Holy Grail.
436.26	In practice, the Norden bombsight
438.26	can drop a bomb into
438.26	a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft.,
441.26	but that's under perfect conditions.
443.26	And of course, in wartime,
445.26	conditions aren't perfect.
447.26	First of all, it's really hard to use --
447.26	really hard to use.
450.26	And not all of the people
452.26	who are of those 50,000 men
452.26	who are bombardiers
454.26	have the ability to properly
454.26	program an analog computer.
458.26	Secondly, it breaks down a lot.
460.26	It's full of all kinds
460.26	of gyroscopes and pulleys
462.26	and gadgets and ball-bearings,
464.26	and they don't work as well
464.26	as they ought to
466.26	in the heat of battle.
468.26	Thirdly, when Norden
468.26	was making his calculations,
471.26	he assumed that a plane would be flying
473.26	at a relatively slow speed
473.26	at low altitudes.
476.26	Well in a real war, you can't do that;
478.26	you'll get shot down.
480.26	So they started flying them
480.26	at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds.
483.26	And the Norden bombsight
483.26	doesn't work as well
485.26	under those conditions.
487.26	But most of all,
489.26	the Norden bombsight
489.26	required the bombardier
491.26	to make visual contact with the target.
494.26	But of course, what happens in real life?
496.26	There are clouds, right.
499.26	It needs cloudless sky
499.26	to be really accurate.
502.26	Well how many cloudless skies
504.26	do you think there
504.26	were above Central Europe
506.26	between 1940 and 1945?
509.26	Not a lot.
511.26	And then to give you a sense
513.26	of just how inaccurate
513.26	the Norden bombsight was,
515.26	there was a famous case in 1944
517.26	where the Allies bombed
517.26	a chemical plant in Leuna, Germany.
521.26	And the chemical plant comprised
525.26	And over the course
525.26	of 22 bombing missions,
528.26	the Allies dropped 85,000 bombs
533.26	on this 757 acre chemical plant,
537.26	using the Norden bombsight.
540.26	Well what percentage of those bombs
542.26	do you think actually landed
544.26	inside the 700-acre
544.26	perimeter of the plant?
550.26	And of those 10 percent that landed,
	they were duds.
555.26	The Leuna chemical plant,
557.26	after one of the most extensive
557.26	bombings in the history of the war,
560.26	was up and running within weeks.
563.26	And by the way, all those precautions
565.26	to keep the Norden bombsight
565.26	out of the hands of the Nazis?
568.26	Well it turns out
570.26	that Carl Norden, as a proper Swiss,
572.26	was very enamored of German engineers.
575.26	So in the 1930s,
575.26	he hired a whole bunch of them,
577.26	including a man named Hermann Long
579.26	who, in 1938,
581.26	gave a complete set of the plans
581.26	for the Norden bombsight to the Nazis.
584.26	So they had their own Norden bombsight
584.26	throughout the entire war --
587.26	which also, by the way,
587.26	didn't work very well.
590.26	(Laughter)
592.26	So why do we talk about
592.26	the Norden bombsight?
595.26	Well because we live in an age
597.26	where there are lots and lots
599.26	of Norden bombsights.
601.26	We live in a time
601.26	where there are all kinds
603.26	of really, really smart people
605.26	running around, saying
605.26	that they've invented gadgets
607.26	that will forever change our world.
609.26	They've invented websites
609.26	that will allow people to be free.
612.26	They've invented some kind of this thing,
612.26	or this thing, or this thing
616.26	that will make our world forever better.
619.26	If you go into the military,
621.26	you'll find lots of Carl Nordens as well.
623.26	If you go to the Pentagon, they will say,
625.26	"""You know what, now we really can"
627.26	put a bomb inside a pickle barrel
629.26	"at 20,000 ft."""
631.26	And you know what, it's true;
631.26	they actually can do that now.
634.26	But we need to be very clear
636.26	about how little that means.
639.26	In the Iraq War, at the beginning
639.26	of the first Iraq War,
642.26	the U.S. military, the air force,
644.26	sent two squadrons
644.26	of F-15E Fighter Eagles
647.26	to the Iraqi desert
649.26	equipped with these
649.26	five million dollar cameras
651.26	that allowed them to see
651.26	the entire desert floor.
654.26	And their mission was
654.26	to find and to destroy --
657.26	remember the Scud missile launchers,
659.26	those surface-to-air missiles
661.26	that the Iraqis were launching
661.26	at the Israelis?
663.26	The mission of the two squadrons
665.26	was to get rid of all the
665.26	Scud missile launchers.
668.26	And so they flew missions day and night,
670.26	and they dropped thousands of bombs,
672.26	and they fired thousands of missiles
675.26	in an attempt to get rid
675.26	of this particular scourge.
678.26	And after the war was over,
678.26	there was an audit done --
680.26	as the army always does,
680.26	the air force always does --
682.26	and they asked the question:
684.26	how many Scuds did we actually destroy?
686.26	You know what the answer was?
688.26	Zero, not a single one.
690.26	Now why is that?
692.26	Is it because their weapons
692.26	weren't accurate?
694.26	Oh no, they were brilliantly accurate.
697.26	They could have destroyed
697.26	this little thing right here
699.26	from 25,000 ft.
701.26	The issue was they didn't know
701.26	where the Scud launchers were.
705.26	The problem with bombs and pickle barrels
708.26	is not getting the bomb
708.26	inside the pickle barrel,
710.26	it's knowing how to
710.26	find the pickle barrel.
713.26	That's always been the harder problem
715.26	when it comes to fighting wars.
717.26	Or take the battle in Afghanistan.
720.26	What is the signature weapon
722.26	of the CIA's war in Northwest Pakistan?
724.26	It's the drone. What is the drone?
727.26	Well it is the grandson
727.26	of the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.
731.26	It is this weapon of devastating
731.26	accuracy and precision.
735.26	And over the course of the last six years
737.26	in Northwest Pakistan,
740.26	the CIA has flown hundreds
740.26	of drone missiles,
743.26	and it's used those drones
745.26	to kill 2,000 suspected
747.26	Pakistani and Taliban militants.
751.26	Now what is the accuracy of those drones?
754.26	Well it's extraordinary.
756.26	We think we're now at 95 percent accuracy
759.26	when it comes to drone strikes.
	we kill need to be killed, right?
764.26	That is one of the most
764.26	extraordinary records
766.26	in the history of modern warfare.
768.26	But do you know what the crucial thing is?
770.26	In that exact same period
772.26	that we've been using these drones
774.26	with devastating accuracy,
776.26	the number of attacks, of suicide attacks
776.26	and terrorist attacks,
779.26	against American forces in Afghanistan
781.26	has increased tenfold.
784.26	As we have gotten more and more efficient
786.26	in killing them,
788.26	they have become angrier and angrier
791.26	and more and more motivated to kill us.
794.26	I have not described
794.26	to you a success story.
797.26	I've described to you
799.26	the opposite of a success story.
801.26	And this is the problem
803.26	with our infatuation
803.26	with the things we make.
805.26	We think the things
805.26	we make can solve our problems,
808.26	but our problems are much
808.26	more complex than that.
811.26	The issue isn't the accuracy
811.26	of the bombs you have,
814.26	it's how you use the bombs you have,
816.26	and more importantly,
818.26	whether you ought to use bombs at all.
822.26	There's a postscript
824.26	to the Norden story
826.26	of Carl Norden and his fabulous bombsight.
829.26	And that is, on August 6, 1945,
832.26	a B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay
835.26	flew over Japan
837.26	and, using a Norden bombsight,
839.26	dropped a very large thermonuclear device
842.26	on the city of Hiroshima.
845.26	And as was typical
845.26	with the Norden bombsight,
848.26	the bomb actually
848.26	missed its target by 800 ft.
851.26	But of course, it didn't matter.
854.26	And that's the greatest irony of all
856.26	when it comes to the Norden bombsight.
859.26	the air force's 1.5 billion
859.26	dollar bombsight
863.26	was used to drop
863.26	its three billion dollar bomb,
867.26	which didn't need a bombsight at all.
870.26	Meanwhile, back in New York,
872.26	no one told Carl Norden
874.26	that his bombsight was used
874.26	over Hiroshima.
877.26	He was a committed Christian.
879.26	He thought he had designed something
881.26	that would reduce the toll
881.26	of suffering in war.
884.26	It would have broken his heart.
887.26	(Applause)
