12.832	Cybercrime is out of control.
18.006	It's everywhere.
19.395	We hear about it every single day.
24.591	This year,
25.829	over two billion records lost or stolen.
31.87	And last year, 100 million of us,
31.87	mostly Americans,
37.529	lost our health insurance data
37.529	to thieves -- myself included.
44.123	What's particularly concerning about this
44.123	is that in most cases,
49.595	it was months before anyone even
49.595	reported that these records were stolen.
56.984	So if you watch the evening news,
60.051	you would think that most of this
60.051	is espionage or nation-state activity.
65.813	And, well, some of it is.
68.514	Espionage, you see, is an accepted
68.514	international practice.
73.613	But in this case,
75.12	it is only a small portion
75.12	of the problem that we're dealing with.
81.459	How often do we hear about a breach
84.818	"followed by, ""... it was the result"
84.818	"of a sophisticated nation-state attack?"""
90.481	Well, often that is companies
90.481	not being willing to own up
95.366	to their own lackluster
95.366	security practices.
98.885	There is also a widely held belief
102.175	that by blaming an attack
102.175	on a nation-state,
106.05	you are putting regulators at bay --
108.755	at least for a period of time.
111.657	So where is all of this coming from?
116.817	The United Nations estimates
116.817	that 80 percent of it
122.334	is from highly organized
122.334	and ultrasophisticated criminal gangs.
129.074	To date,
130.817	this represents one of the largest
130.817	illegal economies in the world,
137.441	topping out at, now get this,
145.359	Let me put that in perspective
145.359	for all of you:
154.423	of 160 nations,
157.113	including Ireland, Finland,
157.113	Denmark and Portugal,
161.682	to name a few.
164.113	So how does this work?
166.141	How do these criminals operate?
168.521	Well, let me tell you a little story.
172.351	About a year ago,
173.569	our security researchers were tracking
176.903	a somewhat ordinary but sophisticated
176.903	banking Trojan called the Dyre Wolf.
183.745	The Dyre Wolf would get on your computer
185.99	via you clicking on a link
185.99	in a phishing email
189.014	that you probably shouldn't have.
190.99	It would then sit and wait.
193.575	It would wait until you logged
193.575	into your bank account.
197.119	And when you did,
197.119	the bad guys would reach in,
200.486	steal your credentials,
202.163	and then use that to steal your money.
204.843	This sounds terrible,
206.787	but the reality is,
206.787	in the security industry,
209.604	this form of attack
209.604	is somewhat commonplace.
215.822	However, the Dyre Wolf had
215.822	two distinctly different personalities --
222.479	one for these small transactions,
224.844	but it took on an entirely
224.844	different persona
227.908	if you were in the business of moving
227.908	large-scale wire transfers.
231.747	Here's what would happen.
233.47	You start the process
233.47	of issuing a wire transfer,
236.294	and up in your browser would pop
236.294	a screen from your bank,
239.326	indicating that there's a problem
239.326	with your account,
241.947	and that you need to call
241.947	the bank immediately,
245.162	along with the number
245.162	to the bank's fraud department.
248.655	So you pick up the phone and you call.
250.849	And after going through
250.849	the normal voice prompts,
253.884	you're met with
253.884	an English-speaking operator.
256.025	"""Hello, Altoro Mutual Bank."
256.025	"How can I help you?"""
259.853	And you go through the process
259.853	like you do every time you call your bank,
263.53	of giving them your name
263.53	and your account number,
266.345	going through the security checks
266.345	to verify you are who you said you are.
271.629	Most of us may not know this,
273.141	but in many large-scale wire transfers,
275.394	it requires two people to sign off
275.394	on the wire transfer,
278.529	so the operator then asks you
278.529	to get the second person on the line,
281.752	and goes through the same set
281.752	of verifications and checks.
285.78	Sounds normal, right?
287.729	Only one problem:
289.195	you're not talking to the bank.
291.044	You're talking to the criminals.
292.654	They had built
292.654	an English-speaking help desk,
294.876	fake overlays to the banking website.
296.965	And this was so flawlessly executed
300.089	that they were moving
300.089	between a half a million
302.256	and a million and a half
302.256	dollars per attempt
305.367	into their criminal coffers.
307.96	These criminal organizations operate
310.599	like highly regimented,
310.599	legitimate businesses.
314.165	Their employees work
314.165	Monday through Friday.
317.129	They take the weekends off.
318.689	How do we know this?
320.096	We know this because
320.096	our security researchers see
323.253	repeated spikes of malware
323.253	on a Friday afternoon.
327.074	The bad guys, after a long weekend
327.074	with the wife and kids,
330.313	come back in to see how well things went.
335.521	The Dark Web is where
335.521	they spend their time.
339.115	That is a term used to describe
339.115	the anonymous underbelly of the internet,
344.928	where thieves can operate with anonymity
347.877	and without detection.
350.029	Here they peddle their attack software
353.08	and share information
353.08	on new attack techniques.
357.391	You can buy everything there,
359.265	from a base-level attack
359.265	to a much more advanced version.
363.662	In fact, in many cases, you even see
365.978	gold, silver and bronze levels of service.
369.723	You can check references.
371.797	You can even buy attacks
374.381	that come with a money-back guarantee --
377.733	(Laughter)
378.802	if you're not successful.
381.751	Now, these environments,
381.751	these marketplaces --
384.866	they look like an Amazon or an eBay.
388.237	You see products, prices,
388.237	ratings and reviews.
392.217	Of course, if you're going
392.217	to buy an attack,
394.495	you're going to buy from a reputable
394.495	criminal with good ratings, right?
397.968	(Laughter)
398.996	This isn't any different
400.221	than checking on Yelp or TripAdvisor
400.221	before going to a new restaurant.
406.323	So, here is an example.
408.44	This is an actual screenshot
408.44	of a vendor selling malware.
413.885	Notice they're a vendor level four,
415.724	they have a trust level of six.
417.589	They've had 400 positive reviews
417.589	in the last year,
419.948	and only two negative reviews
419.948	in the last month.
422.892	We even see things like licensing terms.
426.582	Here's an example of a site you can go to
428.61	if you want to change your identity.
430.391	They will sell you a fake ID,
432.272	fake passports.
434.423	But note the legally binding terms
434.423	for purchasing your fake ID.
440.338	Give me a break.
441.883	What are they going to do --
441.883	sue you if you violate them?
444.765	(Laughter)
447.278	This occurred a couple of months ago.
449.725	One of our security
449.725	researchers was looking
453.364	at a new Android malware application
453.364	that we had discovered.
458.386	It was called Bilal Bot.
461.334	In a blog post,
463.284	she positioned Bilal Bot
463.284	as a new, inexpensive and beta alternative
470.69	to the much more advanced GM Bot
474.052	that was commonplace
474.052	in the criminal underground.
478.478	This review did not sit well
478.478	with the authors of Bilal Bot.
483.057	So they wrote her this very email,
486.848	pleading their case
486.848	and making the argument
489.629	that they felt she had evaluated
489.629	an older version.
496.018	They asked her to please update
496.018	her blog with more accurate information
500.751	and even offered to do an interview
504.187	to describe to her in detail
506.432	how their attack software was now
506.432	far better than the competition.
512.185	So look,
513.534	you don't have to like what they do,
517.422	but you do have to respect
517.422	the entrepreneurial nature
522.365	of their endeavors.
523.596	(Laughter)
526.296	So how are we going to stop this?
531.534	It's not like we're going to be able
531.534	to identify who's responsible --
537.122	remember, they operate with anonymity
540.108	and outside the reach of the law.
543.037	We're certainly not going to be able
543.037	to prosecute the offenders.
546.976	I would propose that we need
546.976	a completely new approach.
553.583	And that approach needs
553.583	to be centered on the idea
557.513	that we need to change
557.513	the economics for the bad guys.
562.065	And to give you a perspective
562.065	on how this can work,
565.19	let's think of the response we see
565.19	to a healthcare pandemic:
570.202	SARS, Ebola, bird flu, Zika.
573.856	What is the top priority?
575.801	It's knowing who is infected
575.801	and how the disease is spreading.
583.835	Now, governments, private institutions,
583.835	hospitals, physicians --
590.881	everyone responds openly and quickly.
595.154	This is a collective and altruistic effort
599.149	to stop the spread in its tracks
603.073	and to inform anyone not infected
605.974	how to protect or inoculate themselves.
610.72	Unfortunately, this is not at all
610.72	what we see in response to a cyber attack.
617.67	Organizations are far more likely
617.67	to keep information on that attack
622.145	to themselves.
624.902	Why?
626.082	Because they're worried
626.082	about competitive advantage,
629.863	litigation
631.458	or regulation.
633.647	We need to effectively democratize
633.647	threat intelligence data.
639.795	We need to get all of these organizations
639.795	to open up and share
645.295	what is in their private arsenal
645.295	of information.
650.83	The bad guys are moving fast;
653.648	we've got to move faster.
656.57	And the best way to do that is to open up
660.316	and share data on what's happening.
663.124	Let's think about this in the construct
663.124	of security professionals.
667.984	Remember, they're programmed right
667.984	into their DNA to keep secrets.
672.984	We've got to turn
672.984	that thinking on its head.
676.032	We've got to get governments,
676.032	private institutions
679.337	and security companies
680.804	willing to share information at speed.
683.559	And here's why:
685.259	because if you share the information,
687.16	it's equivalent to inoculation.
690.483	And if you're not sharing,
692.054	you're actually part of the problem,
694.179	because you're increasing the odds
694.179	that other people could be impacted
699.971	by the same attack techniques.
703.806	But there's an even bigger benefit.
707.018	By destroying criminals' devices
707.018	closer to real time,
711.788	we break their plans.
715.282	We inform the people they aim to hurt
718.546	far sooner than they had ever anticipated.
722.34	We ruin their reputations,
724.565	we crush their ratings and reviews.
728.125	We make cybercrime not pay.
732.751	We change the economics for the bad guys.
738.135	But to do this,
738.135	a first mover was required --
742.131	someone to change the thinking
742.131	in the security industry overall.
747.887	About a year ago,
749.181	my colleagues and I had a radical idea.
752.444	What if IBM were to take our data --
757.807	we had one of the largest threat
757.807	intelligence databases in the world --
761.819	and open it up?
763.577	It had information not just
763.577	on what had happened in the past,
767.062	but what was happening in near-real time.
769.561	What if we were to publish it all
769.561	openly on the internet?
774.283	As you can imagine,
774.283	this got quite a reaction.
776.801	First came the lawyers:
778.189	What are the legal
778.189	implications of doing that?
781.205	Then came the business:
782.564	What are the business
782.564	implications of doing that?
785.442	And this was also met with a good dose
787.639	of a lot of people just asking
787.639	if we were completely crazy.
791.748	But there was one conversation
791.748	that kept floating to the surface
795.558	in every dialogue that we would have:
798.22	the realization that if we didn't do this,
801.791	then we were part of the problem.
805.334	So we did something unheard of
805.334	in the security industry.
808.865	We started publishing.
810.562	Over 700 terabytes of actionable
810.562	threat intelligence data,
814.996	including information on real-time attacks
818.025	that can be used to stop
818.025	cybercrime in its tracks.
821.633	And to date,
823.027	over 4,000 organizations
823.027	are leveraging this data,
827.095	including half of the Fortune 100.
830.419	And our hope as a next step
830.419	is to get all of those organizations
834.46	to join us in the fight,
836.445	and do the same thing
838.02	and share their information
840.132	on when and how
840.132	they're being attacked as well.
843.372	We all have the opportunity to stop it,
846.414	and we already all know how.
849.192	All we have to do is look
849.192	to the response that we see
853.586	in the world of health care,
855.116	and how they respond to a pandemic.
857.443	Simply put,
858.846	we need to be open and collaborative.
861.696	Thank you.
862.871	(Applause)
