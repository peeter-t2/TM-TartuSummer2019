12.575	In my early days as a graduate student,
14.614	I went on a snorkeling trip
14.614	off the coast of the Bahamas.
18.609	I'd actually never swum
18.609	in the ocean before,
21.582	so it was a bit terrifying.
23.836	What I remember the most is,
23.836	as I put my head in the water
26.86	and I was trying really hard
26.86	to breathe through the snorkel,
31.134	this huge group
31.134	of striped yellow and black fish
36.524	came straight at me ...
38.637	and I just froze.
40.795	And then, as if it had
40.795	suddenly changed its mind,
44.432	came towards me
44.432	and then swerved to the right
46.893	and went right around me.
48.74	It was absolutely mesmerizing.
50.29	Maybe many of you
50.29	have had this experience.
53.059	Of course, there's the color
53.059	and the beauty of it,
56.505	but there was also
56.505	just the sheer oneness of it,
59.457	as if it wasn't hundreds of fish
61.824	but a single entity
61.824	with a single collective mind
64.983	that was making decisions.
67.486	When I look back, I think that experience
67.486	really ended up determining
71.192	what I've worked on for most of my career.
75.977	I'm a computer scientist,
77.281	and the field that I work in
77.281	is artificial intelligence.
80.459	And a key theme in AI
82	is being able to understand intelligence
82	by creating our own computational systems
86.467	that display intelligence
86.467	the way we see it in nature.
90.287	Now, most popular views of AI, of course,
90.287	come from science fiction and the movies,
94.749	and I'm personally a big Star Wars fan.
98.321	But that tends to be a very human-centric
98.321	view of intelligence.
102.964	When you think of a fish school,
105.195	or when I think of a flock of starlings,
108.172	that feels like a really different
108.172	kind of intelligence.
112.765	For starters, any one fish is just so tiny
116.702	compared to the sheer size
116.702	of the collective,
119.613	so it seems that any one individual
122.747	would have a really limited
122.747	and myopic view of what's going on,
125.764	and intelligence
125.764	isn't really about the individual
128.122	but somehow a property
128.122	of the group itself.
131.938	Secondly, and the thing
131.938	that I still find most remarkable,
135.193	is that we know that there are no leaders
135.193	supervising this fish school.
140.983	Instead, this incredible
140.983	collective mind behavior
144.508	is emerging purely from the interactions
144.508	of one fish and another.
149.064	Somehow, there are these interactions
149.064	or rules of engagement
153.056	between neighboring fish
154.835	that make it all work out.
157.556	So the question for AI then becomes,
160.231	what are those rules of engagement
160.231	that lead to this kind of intelligence,
164.413	and of course, can we create our own?
166.819	And that's the primary thing
166.819	that I work on with my team in my lab.
170.763	We work on it through theory,
172.424	looking at abstract rule systems
174.796	and thinking about
174.796	the mathematics behind it.
177.717	We also do it through biology,
177.717	working closely with experimentalists.
182.399	But mostly, we do it through robotics,
184.376	where we try to create
184.376	our own collective systems
188.304	that can do the kinds of things
188.304	that we see in nature,
191.035	or at least try to.
193.727	One of our first robotic quests
193.727	along this line
196.555	was to create our very own colony
196.555	of a thousand robots.
200.96	So very simple robots,
202.318	but they could be programmed
202.318	to exhibit collective intelligence,
205.945	and that's what we were able to do.
208.014	So this is what a single robot looks like.
210.07	It's quite small,
210.07	about the size of a quarter,
212.617	and you can program how it moves,
214.951	but it can also wirelessly
214.951	communicate with other robots,
218.391	and it can measure distances from them.
220.582	And so now we can start to program
220.582	exactly an interaction,
224.082	a rule of engagement between neighbors.
226.533	And once we have this system,
228.451	we can start to program many
228.451	different kinds of rules of engagement
231.891	that you would see in nature.
233.421	So for example,
233.421	spontaneous synchronization,
236.421	how audiences are clapping
236.421	and suddenly start all clapping together,
241.683	the fireflies flashing together.
246.739	We can program rules
246.739	for pattern formation,
249.454	how cells in a tissue
251.264	determine what role
251.264	they're going to take on
253.39	and set the patterns of our bodies.
256.865	We can program rules for migration,
258.978	and in this way, we're really learning
258.978	from nature's rules.
262.415	But we can also take it a step further.
265.086	We can actually take these rules
265.086	that we've learned from nature
268.102	and combine them and create
268.102	entirely new collective behaviors
271.92	of our very own.
273.78	So for example,
275.282	imagine that you had
275.282	two different kinds of rules.
278.194	So your first rule is a motion rule
280.337	where a moving robot can move
280.337	around other stationary robots.
284.702	And your second rule is a pattern rule
286.537	where a robot takes on a color
286.537	based on its two nearest neighbors.
290.499	So if I start with a blob of robots
290.499	in a little pattern seed,
293.968	it turns out that these two rules
293.968	are sufficient for the group
296.898	to be able to self-assemble
296.898	a simple line pattern.
300.934	And if I have more
300.934	complicated pattern rules,
303.502	and I design error correction rules,
305.843	we can actually create really,
305.843	really complicated self assemblies,
308.964	and here's what that looks like.
311.694	So here, you're going to see
311.694	a thousand robots
314.703	that are working together
314.703	to self-assemble the letter K.
318.189	The K is on its side.
320.043	And the important thing
320.043	is that no one is in charge.
322.798	So any single robot is only talking
322.798	to a small number of robots nearby it,
327.647	and it's using its motion rule
327.647	to move around the half-built structure
331.608	just looking for a place to fit in
331.608	based on its pattern rules.
335.614	And even though no robot
335.614	is doing anything perfectly,
340.036	the rules are such that we can get
340.036	the collective to do its goal
343.72	robustly together.
345.853	And the illusion becomes
345.853	almost so perfect, you know --
348.859	you just start to not even notice
348.859	that they're individual robots at all,
352.299	and it becomes a single entity,
354.006	kind of like the school of fish.
359.833	So these are robots and rules
359.833	in two dimensions,
362.596	but we can also think about robots
362.596	and rules in three dimensions.
365.931	So what if we could create robots
365.931	that could build together?
370.396	And here, we can take inspiration
370.396	from social insects.
374.009	So if you think about
374.009	mound-building termites
376.693	or you think about army ants,
378.769	they create incredible,
378.769	complex nest structures out of mud
383.046	and even out of their own bodies.
386.422	And like the system I showed you before,
388.666	these insects actually
388.666	also have pattern rules
391.66	that help them determine what to build,
393.722	but the pattern can be made
393.722	out of other insects,
396.048	or it could be made out of mud.
398.998	And we can use that same idea
398.998	to create rules for robots.
404.041	So here, you're going to see
404.041	some simulated robots.
407.226	So the simulated robot has a motion rule,
409.733	which is how it traverses
409.733	through the structure,
412.09	looking for a place to fit in,
414.111	and it has pattern rules
414.111	where it looks at groups of blocks
417.135	to decide whether to place a block.
420.464	And with the right motion rules
420.464	and the right pattern rules,
423.551	we can actually get the robots
423.551	to build whatever we want.
428.017	And of course, everybody wants
428.017	their own tower.
431.17	(Laughter)
433.82	So once we have these rules,
435.528	we can start to create the robot bodies
435.528	that go with these rules.
438.718	So here, you see a robot
438.718	that can climb over blocks,
442.051	but it can also lift and move these blocks
444.756	and it can start to edit
444.756	the very structure that it's on.
448.437	But with these rules,
449.609	this is really only one kind of robot body
449.609	that you could imagine.
453.112	You could imagine
453.112	many different kinds of robot bodies.
455.715	So if you think about robots
455.715	that maybe could move sandbags
460.349	and could help build levees,
462.922	or we could think of robots
462.922	that built out of soft materials
467.247	and worked together
467.247	to shore up a collapsed building --
470.915	so just the same kind of rules
470.915	in different kinds of bodies.
476.03	Or if, like my group, you are completely
476.03	obsessed with army ants,
480.277	then maybe one day we can make robots
480.277	that can climb over literally anything
484.675	including other members of their tribe,
486.873	and self-assemble things
486.873	out of their own bodies.
489.957	Once you understand the rules,
491.662	just many different kinds
491.662	of robot visions become possible.
498.612	And coming back to the snorkeling trip,
500.87	we actually understand a great deal
500.87	about the rules that fish schools use.
506.589	So if we can invent
506.589	the bodies to go with that,
509.449	then maybe there is a future
510.901	where I and my group will get to snorkel
510.901	with a fish school of our own creation.
520.67	Each of these systems that I showed you
522.823	brings us closer to having
522.823	the mathematical and the conceptual tools
527.124	to create our own versions
527.124	of collective power,
530.529	and this can enable many different kinds
530.529	of future applications,
533.554	whether you think about robots
533.554	that build flood barriers
536.742	or you think about robotic bee colonies
536.742	that could pollinate crops
541.063	or underwater schools of robots
541.063	that monitor coral reefs,
544.611	or if we reach for the stars
544.611	and we thinking about programming
547.738	constellations of satellites.
549.968	In each of these systems,
551.604	being able to understand
551.604	how to design the rules of engagement
555.175	and being able to create
555.175	good collective behavior
557.713	becomes a key to realizing these visions.
562.562	So, so far I've talked about
562.562	rules for insects and for fish
566.693	and for robots,
569.086	but what about the rules that apply
569.086	to our own human collective?
572.686	And the last thought
572.686	that I'd like to leave you with
575.14	is that science is of course itself
576.845	an incredible manifestation
576.845	of collective intelligence,
580.353	but unlike the beautiful
580.353	fish schools that I study,
583.695	I feel we still have a much longer
583.695	evolutionary path to walk.
588.566	So in addition to working on improving
588.566	the science of robot collectives,
593.194	I also work on creating robots
593.194	and thinking about rules
596.495	that will improve
596.495	our own scientific collective.
600.018	There's this saying that I love:
601.71	who does science
601.71	determines what science gets done.
606.059	Imagine a society
609.024	where we had rules of engagement
610.699	where every child grew up believing
610.699	that they could stand here
614.026	and be a technologist of the future,
616.472	or where every adult
617.997	believed that they had the ability
617.997	not just to understand but to change
622.14	how science and technology
622.14	impacts their everyday lives.
626.64	What would that society look like?
630.206	I believe that we can do that.
631.738	I believe that we can choose our rules,
634.053	and we engineer not just robots
635.834	but we can engineer
635.834	our own human collective,
638.454	and if we do and when we do,
638.454	it will be beautiful.
642.312	Thank you.
643.487	(Applause)
