12.727	Loneliness.
15.295	All of us in this room
15.295	will experience loneliness
17.67	at some point in our lives.
19.834	Loneliness is not
19.834	a function of being alone,
22.809	but rather, a function
22.809	of how socially connected you are
25.492	to those around you.
27.779	There could be somebody
27.779	in this room right now
29.997	surrounded by a thousand people
31.558	experiencing loneliness.
35.104	And while loneliness
35.104	can be attributed to many things,
38.781	as an architect,
40.536	I'm going to tell you today
40.536	how loneliness can be the result
43.497	of our built environments --
45.477	the very homes we choose to live in.
49.285	Let's take a look at this house.
51.339	It's a nice house.
52.584	There's a big yard, picket fence,
55.023	two-car garage.
58.018	And the home might be
58.018	in a neighborhood like this.
61.379	And for many people around the globe,
63.924	this home, this neighborhood --
66.889	it's a dream.
68.841	And yet the danger of achieving this dream
71.543	is a false sense of connection
74.426	and an increase in social isolation.
77.251	I know, I can hear you now,
78.732	there's somebody in the room
78.732	screaming at me inside their head,
82.083	"""That's my house,"
82.083	and that's my neighborhood,
84.398	"and I know everyone on my block!"""
86.876	"To which I would answer, ""Terrific!"""
89.199	And I wish there were
89.199	more people like you,
92.486	because I'd wager to guess
92.486	there's more people in the room
95.378	living in a similar situation
97.124	that might not know their neighbors.
99.536	They might recognize them and say hello,
102.301	but under their breath,
105.236	they're asking their spouse,
107.063	"""What was their name again?"""
109.413	so they can ask a question by name
109.413	to signify they know them.
114.975	Social media also contributes
114.975	to this false sense of connection.
119.498	This image is probably all too familiar.
121.52	You're standing in the elevator,
123.113	sitting in a cafe,
124.291	and you look around,
125.951	and everyone's on their phone.
128.875	You're not texting or checking Facebook,
131.122	but everyone else is,
132.553	and maybe, like me,
132.553	you've been in a situation
134.796	where you've made eye contact,
136.704	smiled and said hello,
139.021	and have that person
139.021	yank out their earbuds
142.354	"and say, ""I'm sorry, what did you say?"""
145.697	I find this incredibly isolating.
148.321	The concept I'd like
148.321	to share with you today
150.529	is an antidote to isolation.
152.523	It's not a new concept.
153.798	In fact, it's an age-old way of living,
155.925	and it still exists in many
155.925	non-European cultures
158.429	around the world.
160.337	And about 50 years ago,
162.239	the Danes decided to make up a new name,
165.38	and since then,
166.562	tens of thousands of Danish people
166.562	have been living in this connected way.
172.29	And it's being pursued
172.29	more widely around the globe
175.682	as people are seeking community.
179.265	This concept
181.638	is cohousing.
185.441	Cohousing is an intentional neighborhood
185.441	where people know each other
188.718	and look after one another.
190.728	In cohousing, you have your own home,
193.252	but you also share significant spaces,
193.252	both indoors and out.
196.857	Before I show you
196.857	some pictures of cohousing,
199.203	I'd like to first introduce you
199.203	to my friends Sheila and Spencer.
202.319	When I first met Sheila and Spencer,
202.319	they were just entering their 60s,
206.275	and Spencer was looking ahead
206.275	at the end of a long career
209.026	in elementary education.
210.776	And he really disliked the idea
212.537	that he might not have
212.537	children in his life
215.074	upon retirement.
218.873	They're now my neighbors.
220.318	We live in a cohousing community
220.318	that I not only designed,
223.356	but developed
224.544	and have my architecture practice in.
227.02	This community is very intentional
227.02	about our social interactions.
230.33	So let me take you on a tour.
233.316	From the outside, we look like
233.316	any other small apartment building.
236.555	In fact, we look identical
236.555	to the one next door,
239.237	except that we're bright yellow.
242.086	Inside, the homes are fairly conventional.
244.496	We all have living rooms and kitchens,
247.033	bedrooms and baths,
248.955	and there are nine of these homes
248.955	around a central courtyard.
252.371	This one's mine,
254.27	and this one is Spencer and Sheila's.
256.755	The thing that makes this building
256.755	uniquely cohousing
259.416	are not the homes,
261.563	but rather, what happens here --
264.25	the social interactions that happen
264.25	in and around that central courtyard.
268.728	When I look across the courtyard,
270.438	I look forward to see Spencer and Sheila.
272.477	In fact, every morning,
272.477	this is what I see,
274.537	Spencer waving at me furiously
274.537	as we're making our breakfasts.
278.884	From our homes, we look down
278.884	into the courtyard,
281.958	and depending on the time of year,
283.774	we see this:
285.147	kids and grownups in various combinations
288.577	playing and hanging out with each other.
290.965	There's a lot of giggling and chatter.
293.299	There's a lot of hula-hooping.
295.887	And every now and then,
295.887	"""Hey, quit hitting me!"""
300.181	or a cry from one of the kids.
301.977	These are the sounds of our daily lives,
305.405	and the sounds of social connectedness.
308.296	At the bottom of the courtyard,
308.296	there are a set of double doors,
311.711	and those lead into the common house.
314.323	I consider the common house
314.323	the secret sauce of cohousing.
318.203	It's the secret sauce
319.39	because it's the place
319.39	where the social interactions
322.288	and community life begin,
324.834	and from there, it radiates out
324.834	through the rest of the community.
331.51	Inside our common house,
331.51	we have a large dining room
334.071	to seat all 28 of us and our guests,
336.677	and we dine together three times a week.
339.978	In support of those meals,
339.978	we have a large kitchen
342.793	so that we can take turns
342.793	cooking for each other
345.312	in teams of three.
346.574	So that means, with 17 adults,
349.916	I lead cook once every six weeks.
352.392	Two other times, I show up
352.392	and help my team
354.794	with the preparation and cleanup.
356.615	And all those other nights,
358.204	I just show up.
360.243	I have dinner, talk with my neighbors,
362.719	and I go home, having been fed
362.719	a delicious meal
365.088	by someone who cares
365.088	about my vegetarian preferences.
371.059	Our nine families
371.059	have intentionally chosen
373.421	an alternative way of living.
375.655	Instead of pursuing the American dream,
377.799	where we might have been isolated
377.799	in our single-family homes,
380.721	we instead chose cohousing,
383.287	so that we can increase
383.287	our social connections.
386.197	And that's how cohousing starts:
388.083	with a shared intention
389.761	to live collaboratively.
391.269	And intention is the single most
391.269	important characteristic
394.172	that differentiates cohousing
394.172	from any other housing model.
398.545	And while intention is difficult to see
400.614	or even show,
402.468	I'm an architect, and I can't help
402.468	but show you more pictures.
405.436	So here are a few examples to illustrate
407.526	how intention has been expressed
409.834	in some of the communities I've visited.
414.279	Through the careful
414.279	selection of furniture,
416.541	lighting and acoustic materials
416.541	to support eating together;
421.876	in the careful visual location
421.876	and visual access
425.032	to kids' play areas around
425.032	and inside the common house;
431.218	in the consideration of scale
433.581	and distribution of social gathering nodes
436.392	in and around the community
436.392	to support our daily lives,
439.733	all of these spaces help
439.733	contribute to and elevate
443.103	the sense of communitas
444.445	in each community.
446.893	"What was that word? ""Communitas."""
449.937	Communitas is a fancy social science way
449.937	"of saying ""spirit of community."""
455.585	And in visiting
455.585	over 80 different communities,
458.071	my measure of communitas became:
460.551	How frequently did residents eat together?
464.665	While it's completely up to each group
466.791	how frequently they have common meals,
470.226	I know some that have eaten together
470.226	every single night
473.289	for the past 40 years.
476.118	I know others
478.059	that have an occasional potluck
478.059	once or twice a month.
481.571	And from my observations, I can tell you,
483.589	those that eat together more frequently,
485.702	exhibit higher levels of communitas.
489.99	It turns out, when you eat together,
492.81	you start planning
492.81	more activities together.
496.02	When you eat together,
496.02	you share more things.
498.217	You start to watch each other's kids.
500.025	You lend our your power tools.
500.025	You borrow each other's cars.
502.964	And despite all this,
505.398	as my daughter loves to say,
506.939	everything is not rainbows
506.939	and unicorns in cohousing,
511.101	and I'm not best friends
511.101	with every single person in my community.
514.902	We even have differences and conflicts.
519.234	But living in cohousing,
519.234	we're intentional about our relationships.
523.505	We're motivated
523.505	to resolve our differences.
526.909	We follow up, we check in,
529.266	we speak our personal truths
531.384	and, when appropriate,
533.552	we apologize.
535.806	Skeptics will say that cohousing
535.806	is only interesting or attractive
539.966	to a very small group of people.
542.249	And I'll agree with that.
544.468	If you look at Western cultures
544.468	around the globe,
546.833	those living in cohousing
546.833	are just a fractional percent.
550.73	But that needs to change,
552.992	because our very lives depend upon it.
556.64	In 2015, Brigham Young University
556.64	completed a study
560.347	that showed a significant
560.347	increase risk of premature death
565.1	in those who were living in isolation.
568.725	The US Surgeon General
568.725	has declared isolation
571.143	to be a public health epidemic.
573.244	And this epidemic
573.244	is not restricted to the US alone.
578.999	So when I said earlier
581.097	that cohousing
581.097	is an antidote to isolation,
585.587	what I should have said
587.232	is that cohousing can save your life.
592.66	If I was a doctor, I would tell you
592.66	to take two aspirin,
595.643	and call me in the morning.
598.356	But as an architect,
599.699	I'm going to suggest
599.699	that you take a walk with your neighbor,
602.754	share a meal together,
605.101	and call me in 20 years.
607.83	Thank you.
609.132	(Applause)
