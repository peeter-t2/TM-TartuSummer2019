12.764	Let's go south.
16.094	All of you are actually going south.
22.539	This is the direction of south, this way,
27.229	and if you go 8,000 kilometers
27.229	out of the back of this room,
33.749	you will come to as far south
33.749	as you can go anywhere on Earth,
38.982	the Pole itself.
41.393	Now, I am not an explorer.
45.201	I'm not an environmentalist.
48.753	I'm actually just a survivor,
52.282	and these photographs
52.282	that I'm showing you here are dangerous.
57.851	They are the ice melt
57.851	of the South and North Poles.
63.976	And ladies and gentlemen,
65.516	we need to listen to what
65.516	these places are telling us,
71.944	and if we don't, we will end up
71.944	with our own survival situation
78.19	here on planet Earth.
81.636	I have faced head-on these places,
87.668	and to walk across a melting ocean of ice
92.196	is without doubt
92.196	the most frightening thing
95.33	that's ever happened to me.
99.117	Antarctica is such a hopeful place.
105.064	It is protected by 
105.064	the Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959.
112.845	In 1991, a 50-year agreement
112.845	was entered into
119.1	that stops any exploitation in Antarctica,
124.855	and this agreement could be altered,
129.695	changed, modified, or even abandoned
135.058	starting in the year 2041.
141.527	Ladies and gentlemen,
144.299	people already far up north
144.299	from here in the Arctic
150.267	are already taking advantage
153.378	of this ice melt,
157.325	taking out resources from areas
157.325	already that have been covered in ice
163.553	for the last 10, 20, 30,000,
170.305	Can they not join the dots
173.578	"and think, ""Why is the ice"
173.578	"actually melting?"""
179.94	This is such an amazing place,
183.284	the Antarctic, and I have worked hard
187.138	for the last 23 years on this mission
192.293	to make sure that what's happening
192.293	up here in the North
196.297	does never happen, 
196.297	cannot happen in the South.
201.716	Where did this all begin?
203.508	It began for me at the age of 11.
206.457	Check out that haircut. 
206.457	It's a bit odd. (Laughter)
209.452	And at the age of 11, 
209.452	I was inspired by the real explorers
214.556	to want to try to be the first
214.556	to walk to both Poles.
219.32	I found it incredibly inspiring
223.685	that the idea of becoming a polar traveler
227.563	went down pretty well with girls 
227.563	at parties when I was at university.
231.91	That was a bit more inspiring.
233.878	And after years, seven
233.878	years of fundraising,
237.5	seven years of being told no,
240.147	seven years of being told
240.147	by my family to seek counseling
246.393	and psychiatric help,
250.155	eventually three of us found ourselves
250.155	marching to the South Geographic Pole
256.112	on the longest unassisted march
256.112	ever made anywhere on Earth in history.
262.14	In this photograph,
262.14	we are standing in an area
265.874	the size of the United States of America,
269.612	and we're on our own.
270.936	We have no radio 
270.936	communications, no backup.
274.467	Beneath our feet,
286.353	We're standing on it.
288.095	This is the power of Antarctica.
292.762	On this journey, we faced
292.762	the danger of crevasses,
296.268	intense cold,
298.566	so cold that sweat turns
298.566	to ice inside your clothing,
304.046	your teeth can crack,
305.834	water can freeze in your eyes.
307.993	Let's just say it's a bit chilly.
307.993	(Laughter)
311.058	And after 70 desperate days,
311.058	we arrive at the South Pole.
315.229	We had done it.
316.977	But something happened to me
316.977	on that 70-day journey in 1986
322.696	that brought me here, and it hurt.
325.5	My eyes changed color
325.5	in 70 days through damage.
330.615	Our faces blistered out.
332.652	The skin ripped off
332.652	and we wondered why.
337.644	And when we got home,
337.644	we were told by NASA
341.173	that a hole in the ozone
341.173	had been discovered
344.029	above the South Pole,
345.562	and we'd walked underneath it
345.562	the same year it had been discovered.
350.925	Ultraviolet rays down, hit the ice,
350.925	bounced back, fried out the eyes,
356.896	ripped off our faces.
360.027	It was a bit of a shock --
360.027	(Laughter) --
363.371	and it started me thinking.
366.877	In 1989, we now head north.
370.104	Sixty days, every step away
370.104	from the safety of land
374.743	across a frozen ocean.
376.629	It was desperately cold again.
378.854	Here's me coming in from washing
378.854	naked at -60 Celsius.
385.823	And if anybody ever says to you,
385.823	"""I am cold"" -- (Laughter) --"
390.305	if they look like this, 
390.305	they are cold, definitely.
396.04	(Applause)
398.958	And 1,000 kilometers away
398.958	from the safety of land,
404.982	disaster strikes.
407.646	The Arctic Ocean melts beneath our feet
407.646	four months before it ever had in history,
415.401	and we're 1,000 kilometers from safety.
418.91	The ice is crashing around us, grinding,
418.91	"and I'm thinking, ""Are we going to die?"""
425.411	But something clicked
425.411	in my head on this day,
429.614	as I realized we, as a world,
429.614	are in a survival situation,
436.706	and that feeling has never gone away
436.706	for 25 long years.
441.07	Back then, we had to march or die.
445.543	And we're not some TV survivor program.
449.351	When things go wrong for us,
449.351	it's life or death,
452.282	and our brave African-American Daryl,
455.596	who would become the first American
455.596	to walk to the North Pole,
459.474	his heel dropped off 
459.474	from frostbite 200 klicks out.
464.071	He must keep going, he does,
466.231	and after 60 days on the ice,
466.231	we stood at the North Pole.
471.061	We had done it.
472.555	Yes, I became the first person in history
472.555	stupid enough to walk to both Poles,
477.825	but it was our success.
481.387	And sadly, on return home,
485.247	it was not all fun.
488.382	I became very low.
490.123	To succeed at something is often harder
490.123	than actually making it happen.
496.412	I was empty, lonely,
496.412	financially destroyed.
500.525	I was without hope,
502.87	but hope came in the form
502.87	of the great Jacques Cousteau,
506.585	and he inspired me to take on 
506.585	the 2041 mission.
511.981	Being Jacques, he gave me
511.981	clear instructions:
515.153	Engage the world leaders,
515.153	talk to industry and business,
519.55	and above all, Rob, inspire young people,
523.489	because they will choose the future
523.489	of the preservation of Antarctica.
528.344	For the world leaders, we've been
528.344	to every world Earth Summit,
532.73	all three of them,
532.73	with our brave yacht, 2041,
537.095	twice to Rio, once in '92, once in 2012,
541.925	and for the Earth Summit in Johannesburg,
545.547	we made the longest overland voyage
545.547	ever made with a yacht,
	the whole of Southern Africa
557.04	doing our best to inspire
557.04	over a million young people in person
563.518	about 2041 and about their environment.
568.58	For the last 11 years,
568.58	we have taken over 1,000 people,
575.499	people from industry and business,
575.499	women and men from companies,
578.518	students from all over the world,
578.518	down to Antarctica,
582.893	and during those missions,
582.893	we've managed to pull out
586.002	over 1,500 tons of twisted metal
586.002	left in Antarctica.
591.652	That took eight years,
591.652	and I'm so proud of it
595.111	because we recycled all of it 
595.111	back here in South America.
602.246	I have been inspired
602.246	ever since I could walk
605.754	to recycle by my mum.
609.051	Here she is, and my mum --
611.528	(Applause) --
615.175	my mum is still recycling,
617.872	and as she is in her 100th year,
617.872	isn't that fantastic?
622.847	(Applause)
625.197	And when -- I love my mum.
628.439	(Laughter)
629.559	But when Mum was born,
632.78	the population of our planet
632.78	was only 1.8 billion people,
639.119	and talking in terms of billions,
641.07	we have taken young people
641.07	from industry and business
644.738	from India, from China.
646.944	These are game-changing nations,
646.944	and will be hugely important
652.724	in the decision about
652.724	the preservation of the Antarctic.
657.544	Unbelievably, we've engaged and inspired
657.544	women to come from the Middle East,
664.393	often for the first time they've 
664.393	represented their nations in Antarctica.
670.551	Fantastic people, so inspired.
673.066	To look after Antarctica,
676.322	you've got to first engage people
676.322	with this extraordinary place,
682.658	form a relationship, form a bond,
686.858	form some love.
689.621	It is such a privilege
689.621	to go to Antarctica,
693.08	I can't tell you.
694.427	I feel so lucky,
696.006	and I've been 35 times in my life,
699.233	and all those people who come with us
699.233	return home as great champions,
703.951	not only for Antarctica,
705.899	but for local issues
705.899	back in their own nations.
709.543	Let's go back to where we began:
709.543	the ice melt of the North and South Poles.
715.891	And it's not good news.
719.713	NASA informed us six months ago
723.689	that the Western Antarctic Ice Shelf
723.689	is now disintegrating.
728.688	Huge areas of ice --
731.113	look how big Antarctica is
731.113	even compared to here --
735.385	Huge areas of ice 
735.385	are breaking off from Antarctica,
739.926	the size of small nations.
742.761	And NASA have calculated
742.761	that the sea level will rise,
747.166	it is definite,
749.34	by one meter in the next 100 years,
752.753	the same time that my mum
752.753	has been on planet Earth.
756.288	It's going to happen,
757.978	and I've realized that 
757.978	the preservation of Antarctica
763.649	and our survival here on Earth are linked.
768.194	And there is a very simple solution.
770.088	If we are using more renewable energy
770.088	in the real world,
775.607	if we are being more efficient
775.607	with the energy here,
781.469	running our energy mix in a cleaner way,
785.765	there will be no financial reason
785.765	to go and exploit Antarctica.
790.611	It won't make financial sense,
792.67	and if we manage our energy better,
792.67	we also may be able to slow down,
800.366	maybe even stop,
802.506	this great ice melt that threatens us.
805.547	It's a big challenge, and what
805.547	is our response to it?
809.097	We've got to go back one last time,
813.069	and at the end of next year,
814.965	we will go back to the
814.965	South Geographic Pole,
818.8	where we arrived 30 years ago on foot,
823.052	and retrace our steps of 1,600 kilometers,
828.777	but this time only using
828.777	renewable energy to survive.
834.827	We will walk across those icecaps,
834.827	which far down below are melting,
840.386	hopefully inspiring some
840.386	solutions on that issue.
845.295	This is my son, Barney.
847.72	He is coming with me.
850.511	He is committed to walking
850.511	side by side with his father,
855.261	and what he will do is
855.261	to translate these messages
859.275	and inspire these messages
859.275	to the minds of future young leaders.
864.9	I'm extremely proud of him.
866.939	Good on him, Barney.
871.623	Ladies and gentlemen, 
871.623	a survivor -- and I'm good --
878.198	a survivor sees a problem
878.198	"and doesn't go, ""Whatever."""
886.686	A survivor sees a problem
886.686	and deals with that problem
890.846	before it becomes a threat.
893.919	We have 27 years
893.919	to preserve the Antarctic.
899.967	We all own it.
902.482	We all have responsibility.
905.262	The fact that nobody owns it 
905.262	maybe means that we can succeed.
910.232	Antarctica is a moral line in the snow,
915.051	and on one side of that line
915.051	we should fight,
918.598	fight hard for this one beautiful,
918.598	pristine place left alone on Earth.
924.311	I know it's possible.
926.472	We are going to do it.
928.492	And I'll leave you with
928.492	these words from Goethe.
932.37	I've tried to live by them.
935.977	"""If you can do, or dream you can,"
943.262	begin it now,
946.234	for boldness has genius,
946.234	"power and magic in it."""
953.026	Good luck to you all.
954.59	Thank you very much.
956.75	(Applause)
