25	I want to talk today about --
28	I've been asked to take the long view, and I'm going to tell you what
34	I think are the three biggest problems for humanity
38	from this long point of view.
41	Some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers,
44	which is encouraging.
46	It seems that there's not just one person
48	who thinks that these problems are important.
50	The first is -- death is a big problem.
54	If you look at the statistics,
57	the odds are not very favorable to us.
59	So far, most people who have lived have also died.
63	Roughly 90 percent of everybody who has been alive has died by now.
67	So the annual death rate adds up to 150,000 --
73	sorry, the daily death rate -- 150,000 people per day,
76	which is a huge number by any standard.
79	The annual death rate, then, becomes 56 million.
84	If we just look at the single, biggest cause of death -- aging --
90	it accounts for roughly two-thirds of all human people who die.
95	That adds up to an annual death toll
98	of greater than the population of Canada.
100	Sometimes, we don't see a problem
102	because either it's too familiar or it's too big.
106	Can't see it because it's too big.
108	I think death might be both too familiar and too big
111	for most people to see it as a problem.
114	Once you think about it, you see this is not statistical points;
116	these are -- let's see, how far have I talked?
118	I've talked for three minutes.
121	So that would be, roughly, 324 people have died since I've begun speaking.
128	People like -- it's roughly the population in this room has just died.
133	Now, the human cost of that is obvious,
135	once you start to think about it -- the suffering, the loss --
138	it's also, economically, enormously wasteful.
141	I just look at the information, and knowledge, and experience
144	that is lost due to natural causes of death in general,
147	and aging, in particular.
149	Suppose we approximated one person with one book?
152	Now, of course, this is an underestimation.
154	A person's lifetime of learning and experience
160	is a lot more than you could put into a single book.
162	But let's suppose we did this.
170	corresponds, then, to 52 million volumes destroyed.
174	Library of Congress holds 18 million volumes.
178	We are upset about the burning of the Library of Alexandria.
181	It's one of the great cultural tragedies
183	that we remember, even today.
187	But this is the equivalent of three Libraries of Congress --
189	burnt down, forever lost -- each year.
192	So that's the first big problem.
194	And I wish Godspeed to Aubrey de Grey,
197	and other people like him,
199	to try to do something about this as soon as possible.
203	Existential risk -- the second big problem.
206	Existential risk is a threat to human survival, or to the long-term potential of our species.
213	Now, why do I say that this is a big problem?
215	Well, let's first look at the probability --
219	and this is very, very difficult to estimate --
222	but there have been only four studies on this in recent years,
225	which is surprising.
227	You would think that it would be of some interest
230	to try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big,
234	but it's a very neglected area.
236	But there have been four studies --
238	one by John Lesley, wrote a book on this.
240	He estimated a probability that we will fail
242	to survive the current century: 50 percent.
245	Similarly, the Astronomer Royal, whom we heard speak yesterday,
250	also has a 50 percent probability estimate.
253	Another author doesn't give any numerical estimate,
256	but says the probability is significant that it will fail.
259	I wrote a long paper on this.
262	I said assigning a less than 20 percent probability would be a mistake
266	in light of the current evidence we have.
269	Now, the exact figures here,
271	we should take with a big grain of salt,
273	but there seems to be a consensus that the risk is substantial.
276	Everybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees.
279	Now, if we think about what just reducing
281	the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point --
286	not very much -- so that's equivalent to 60 million lives saved,
291	if we just count the currently living people, the current generation.
295	Now one percent of six billion people is equivalent to 60 million.
299	So that's a large number.
301	If we were to take into account future generations
304	that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up,
309	then the figure becomes astronomical.
312	If we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe --
315	the Virgo supercluster --
317	maybe it will take us 100 million years to get there,
319	but if we go extinct we never will.
322	Then, even a one percentage point reduction
325	in the extinction risk could be equivalent
329	to this astronomical number -- 10 to the power of 32.
332	So if you take into account future generations as much as our own,
336	every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant.
341	The only thing you should focus on
343	would be to reduce existential risk
345	because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk
349	would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve.
353	And even if you just look at the current people,
355	and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct,
360	it should still have a high priority.
362	Now, let me spend the rest of my time on the third big problem,
367	because it's more subtle and perhaps difficult to grasp.
373	Think about some time in your life --
377	some people might never have experienced it -- but some people,
380	there are just those moments that you have experienced
383	where life was fantastic.
385	It might have been at the moment of some great, creative inspiration
392	you might have had when you just entered this flow stage.
394	Or when you understood something you had never done before.
396	Or perhaps in the ecstasy of romantic love.
400	Or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a great piece of art.
405	Every once in a while we have these moments,
407	and we realize just how good life can be when it's at its best.
411	And you wonder, why can't it be like that all the time?
416	You just want to cling onto this.
418	And then, of course, it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades.
422	And it's really difficult to recall, in a normal frame of mind,
426	just how good life can be at its best.
429	Or how bad it can be at its worst.
432	The third big problem is that life isn't usually
435	as wonderful as it could be.
437	I think that's a big, big problem.
441	It's easy to say what we don't want.
444	Here are a number of things that we don't want --
447	illness, involuntary death, unnecessary suffering, cruelty,
450	stunted growth, memory loss, ignorance, absence of creativity.
456	Suppose we fixed these things -- we did something about all of these.
459	We were very successful.
461	We got rid of all of these things.
463	We might end up with something like this,
466	which is -- I mean, it's a heck of a lot better than that.
470	But is this really the best we can dream of?
475	Is this the best we can do?
477	Or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards?
483	And if we think about this,
485	I think it's very clear that there are ways
489	in which we could change things, not just by eliminating negatives,
492	but adding positives.
494	On my wish list, at least, would be:
496	much longer, healthier lives, greater subjective well-being,
501	enhanced cognitive capacities, more knowledge and understanding,
506	unlimited opportunity for personal growth
508	beyond our current biological limits, better relationships,
512	an unbounded potential for spiritual, moral
514	and intellectual development.
516	If we want to achieve this, what, in the world, would have to change?
524	And this is the answer -- we would have to change.
529	Not just the world around us, but we, ourselves.
532	Not just the way we think about the world, but the way we are -- our very biology.
536	Human nature would have to change.
538	Now, when we think about changing human nature,
540	the first thing that comes to mind
542	are these human modification technologies --
546	growth hormone therapy, cosmetic surgery,
548	stimulants like Ritalin, Adderall, anti-depressants,
551	anabolic steroids, artificial hearts.
553	It's a pretty pathetic list.
556	They do great things for a few people
558	who suffer from some specific condition,
560	but for most people, they don't really transform
565	what it is to be human.
567	And they also all seem a little bit --
569	most people have this instinct that, well, sure,
572	there needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people.
574	But there's a kind of queasiness
576	that these are unnatural in some way.
579	It's worth recalling that there are a lot of other
581	modification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use.
584	We have skin enhancements, clothing.
588	As far as I can see, all of you are users of this
592	enhancement technology in this room, so that's a great thing.
597	Mood modifiers have been used from time immemorial --
600	caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, immune system enhancement,
605	vision enhancement, anesthetics --
607	we take that very much for granted,
609	but just think about how great progress that is --
613	like, having an operation before anesthetics was not fun.
617	Contraceptives, cosmetics and brain reprogramming techniques --
623	that sounds ominous,
625	but the distinction between what is a technology --
629	a gadget would be the archetype --
631	and other ways of changing and rewriting human nature is quite subtle.
635	So if you think about what it means to learn arithmetic or to learn to read,
639	you're actually, literally rewriting your own brain.
642	You're changing the microstructure of your brain as you go along.
646	So in a broad sense, we don't need to think about technology
649	as only little gadgets, like these things here,
651	but even institutions and techniques,
655	psychological methods and so forth.
657	Forms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature.
662	Looking ahead, there is a range of technologies
664	that are almost certain to be developed sooner or later.
667	We are very ignorant about what the time scale for these things are,
671	but they all are consistent with everything we know
673	about physical laws, laws of chemistry, etc.
677	It's possible to assume,
679	setting aside a possibility of catastrophe,
682	that sooner or later we will develop all of these.
685	And even just a couple of these would be enough
688	to transform the human condition.
690	So let's look at some of the dimensions of human nature
695	that seem to leave room for improvement.
698	Health span is a big and urgent thing,
700	because if you're not alive,
702	then all the other things will be to little avail.
705	Intellectual capacity -- let's take that box,
707	which falls into a lot of different sub-categories:
712	memory, concentration, mental energy, intelligence, empathy.
715	These are really great things.
717	Part of the reason why we value these traits
719	is that they make us better at competing with other people --
723	they're positional goods.
725	But part of the reason --
727	and that's the reason why we have ethical ground for pursuing these --
731	is that they're also intrinsically valuable.
734	It's just better to be able to understand more of the world around you
738	and the people that you are communicating with,
740	and to remember what you have learned.
744	Modalities and special faculties.
746	Now, the human mind is not a single unitary information processor,
751	but it has a lot of different, special, evolved modules
755	that do specific things for us.
757	If you think about what we normally take as giving life a lot of its meaning --
761	music, humor, eroticism, spirituality, aesthetics,
765	nurturing and caring, gossip, chatting with people --
770	all of these, very likely, are enabled by a special circuitry
774	that we humans have,
776	but that you could have another intelligent life form that lacks these.
779	We're just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery
782	to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it.
786	All of these would enable, in principle -- be amenable to enhancement.
789	Some people have a better musical ability
791	and ability to appreciate music than others have.
793	It's also interesting to think about what other things are --
796	so if these all enabled great values,
800	why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us
803	with all the modalities we would need to engage
806	with other values that there might be?
808	Imagine a species
810	that just didn't have this neural machinery for processing music.
814	And they would just stare at us with bafflement
817	when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance,
821	like the one we just heard -- because of people making stupid movements,
823	and they would be really irritated and wouldn't see what we were up to.
826	But maybe they have another faculty, something else
829	that would seem equally irrational to us,
832	but they actually tap into some great possible value there.
835	But we are just literally deaf to that kind of value.
839	So we could think of adding on different,
841	new sensory capacities and mental faculties.
845	Bodily functionality and morphology and affective self-control.
850	Greater subjective well-being.
852	Be able to switch between relaxation and activity --
855	being able to go slow when you need to do that, and to speed up.
859	Able to switch back and forth more easily
861	would be a neat thing to be able to do --
863	easier to achieve the flow state,
865	when you're totally immersed in something you are doing.
869	Conscientiousness and sympathy.
871	The ability to -- it's another interesting application
874	that would have large social ramification, perhaps.
877	If you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person,
883	undiminished through time,
885	so that wouldn't have to -- love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to.
890	That's probably not all that difficult.
893	It might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this.
898	It's been done in voles.
902	You can engineer a prairie vole to become monogamous
905	when it's naturally polygamous.
907	It's just a single gene.
909	Might be more complicated in humans, but perhaps not that much.
911	This is the last picture that I want to --
914	now we've got to use the laser pointer.
917	A possible mode of being here would be a way of life --
920	a way of being, experiencing, thinking, seeing,
924	interacting with the world.
926	Down here in this little corner, here, we have the little sub-space
931	of this larger space that is accessible to human beings --
935	beings with our biological capacities.
938	It's a part of the space that's accessible to animals;
941	since we are animals, we are a subset of that.
944	And then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities.
948	There would be different modes of being you could experience
951	if you were able to stay alive for, say, 200 years.
954	Then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms
958	that are just not possible for humans as we currently are.
961	"So then, you move off to this larger sphere of ""human +,"""
965	and you could continue that process and eventually
968	explore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being.
972	Now, why is that a good thing to do?
974	Well, we know already that in this little human circle there,
978	there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being --
982	human life at its best is wonderful.
985	We have no reason to believe that within this much, much larger space
990	there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being,
994	perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability
1000	even to imagine or dream about.
1002	And so, to fix this third problem,
1004	I think we need -- slowly, carefully, with ethical wisdom and constraint --
1010	develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it
1015	and find the great values that might hide there.
1017	Thanks.
