12.826	So I'd like you to imagine for a moment
15.493	that you're a soldier
15.493	in the heat of battle.
18.73	Maybe you're a Roman foot soldier
18.73	or a medieval archer
22.285	or maybe you're a Zulu warrior.
24.189	Regardless of your time and place,
24.189	there are some things that are constant.
28.467	Your adrenaline is elevated,
30.385	and your actions are stemming
30.385	from these deeply ingrained reflexes,
35.218	reflexes rooted in a need
35.218	to protect yourself and your side
39.598	and to defeat the enemy.
42.826	So now, I'd like you to imagine
42.826	playing a very different role,
46.387	that of the scout.
48.012	The scout's job is not
48.012	to attack or defend.
51.425	The scout's job is to understand.
54.233	The scout is the one going out,
56.318	mapping the terrain,
56.318	identifying potential obstacles.
60.405	And the scout may hope to learn
60.405	that, say, there's a bridge
64.005	in a convenient location across a river.
66.363	But above all, the scout
66.363	wants to know what's really there,
69.434	as accurately as possible.
72.195	And in a real, actual army, both
72.195	the soldier and the scout are essential.
77.265	But you can also think of each
77.265	of these roles as a mindset --
82.599	a metaphor for how all of us
82.599	process information and ideas
86.25	in our daily lives.
88.192	What I'm going to argue today
88.192	is that having good judgment,
92.046	making accurate predictions,
92.046	making good decisions,
95.284	is mostly about which mindset you're in.
98.994	To illustrate these mindsets in action,
101.611	I'm going to take you back
101.611	to 19th-century France,
105.119	where this innocuous-looking
105.119	piece of paper
108.126	launched one of the biggest
108.126	political scandals in history.
111.718	It was discovered in 1894
111.718	by officers in the French general staff.
116.616	It was torn up in a wastepaper basket,
119.332	but when they pieced it back together,
121.281	they discovered
121.281	that someone in their ranks
123.337	had been selling
123.337	military secrets to Germany.
126.462	So they launched a big investigation,
128.843	and their suspicions
128.843	quickly converged on this man,
132.733	Alfred Dreyfus.
134.867	He had a sterling record,
136.209	no past history of wrongdoing,
136.209	no motive as far as they could tell.
140.342	But Dreyfus was the only
140.342	Jewish officer at that rank in the army,
145.484	and unfortunately at this time,
145.484	the French Army was highly anti-Semitic.
149.683	They compared Dreyfus's handwriting
149.683	to that on the memo
152.929	and concluded that it was a match,
154.89	even though outside
154.89	professional handwriting experts
157.956	were much less confident
157.956	in the similarity,
160.13	but never mind that.
161.544	They went and searched
161.544	Dreyfus's apartment,
163.608	looking for any signs of espionage.
165.388	They went through his files,
165.388	and they didn't find anything.
168.372	This just convinced them more
168.372	that Dreyfus was not only guilty,
171.53	but sneaky as well, because clearly
171.53	he had hidden all of the evidence
174.847	before they had managed to get to it.
177.212	Next, they went and looked
177.212	through his personal history
179.928	for any incriminating details.
182.253	They talked to his teachers,
183.879	they found that he had studied
183.879	foreign languages in school,
186.688	which clearly showed a desire
186.688	to conspire with foreign governments
190.765	later in life.
191.972	His teachers also said that Dreyfus
191.972	was known for having a good memory,
198.007	which was highly suspicious, right?
200.143	You know, because a spy
200.143	has to remember a lot of things.
204.439	So the case went to trial,
204.439	and Dreyfus was found guilty.
208.816	Afterwards, they took him out
208.816	into this public square
212.16	and ritualistically tore
212.16	his insignia from his uniform
215.908	and broke his sword in two.
217.837	This was called
217.837	the Degradation of Dreyfus.
220.86	And they sentenced him
220.86	to life imprisonment
223.401	on the aptly named Devil's Island,
226.165	which is this barren rock
226.165	off the coast of South America.
229.556	So there he went,
229.556	and there he spent his days alone,
233.33	writing letters and letters
233.33	to the French government
235.858	begging them to reopen his case
235.858	so they could discover his innocence.
239.634	But for the most part,
239.634	France considered the matter closed.
243.301	One thing that's really interesting
243.301	to me about the Dreyfus Affair
247.618	is this question of why the officers
247.618	were so convinced
251.42	that Dreyfus was guilty.
253.556	I mean, you might even assume
253.556	that they were setting him up,
256.427	that they were intentionally framing him.
258.419	But historians don't think
258.419	that's what happened.
260.71	As far as we can tell,
261.893	the officers genuinely believed
261.893	that the case against Dreyfus was strong.
266.154	Which makes you wonder:
268.654	What does it say about the human mind
270.952	that we can find such paltry evidence
273.289	to be compelling enough to convict a man?
276.21	Well, this is a case of what scientists
276.21	"call ""motivated reasoning."""
280.52	It's this phenomenon in which
280.52	our unconscious motivations,
283.598	our desires and fears,
285.974	shape the way we interpret information.
288.344	Some information, some ideas,
288.344	feel like our allies.
291.778	We want them to win.
291.778	We want to defend them.
294.444	And other information
294.444	or ideas are the enemy,
296.999	and we want to shoot them down.
299.408	So this is why I call
299.408	"motivated reasoning, ""soldier mindset."""
303.988	Probably most of you have never persecuted
307.017	a French-Jewish officer for high treason,
309.322	I assume,
310.819	but maybe you've followed sports
310.819	or politics, so you might have noticed
315.702	that when the referee judges
315.702	that your team committed a foul,
319.848	for example,
321.034	you're highly motivated
321.034	to find reasons why he's wrong.
324.482	But if he judges that the other team
324.482	committed a foul -- awesome!
327.618	That's a good call,
327.618	let's not examine it too closely.
330.792	Or, maybe you've read
330.792	an article or a study
332.933	that examined some controversial policy,
335.663	like capital punishment.
337.735	And, as researchers have demonstrated,
339.876	if you support capital punishment
341.605	and the study shows
341.605	that it's not effective,
344.145	then you're highly motivated
344.145	to find all the reasons
347.415	why the study was poorly designed.
349.612	But if it shows
349.612	that capital punishment works,
351.842	it's a good study.
353.025	And vice versa: if you don't
353.025	support capital punishment, same thing.
356.297	Our judgment is strongly
356.297	influenced, unconsciously,
359.15	by which side we want to win.
362.071	And this is ubiquitous.
363.984	This shapes how we think
363.984	about our health, our relationships,
367.046	how we decide how to vote,
368.966	what we consider fair or ethical.
372.036	What's most scary to me
372.036	about motivated reasoning
374.823	or soldier mindset,
375.998	is how unconscious it is.
377.269	We can think we're being
377.269	objective and fair-minded
380.573	and still wind up ruining the life
380.573	of an innocent man.
385.008	However, fortunately for Dreyfus,
385.008	his story is not over.
387.915	This is Colonel Picquart.
389.307	He's another high-ranking officer
389.307	in the French Army,
391.875	and like most people,
391.875	he assumed Dreyfus was guilty.
394.893	Also like most people in the army,
394.893	he was at least casually anti-Semitic.
399.342	But at a certain point,
399.342	Picquart began to suspect:
403.302	"""What if we're all wrong about Dreyfus?"""
406.448	What happened was,
406.448	he had discovered evidence
408.65	that the spying for Germany had continued,
411.151	even after Dreyfus was in prison.
413.516	And he had also discovered
413.516	that another officer in the army
416.836	had handwriting that perfectly
416.836	matched the memo,
419.433	much closer than Dreyfus's handwriting.
422.382	So he brought these discoveries
422.382	to his superiors,
426.017	but to his dismay,
426.017	they either didn't care
429.718	or came up with elaborate rationalizations
429.718	to explain his findings,
433.33	"like, ""Well, all you've really shown,"
433.33	Picquart, is that there's another spy
438.727	who learned how to mimic
438.727	Dreyfus's handwriting,
441.124	and he picked up the torch of spying
441.124	after Dreyfus left.
445.148	"But Dreyfus is still guilty."""
447.854	Eventually, Picquart managed
447.854	to get Dreyfus exonerated.
450.903	But it took him 10 years,
452.455	and for part of that time,
452.455	he himself was in prison
455.01	for the crime of disloyalty to the army.
458.491	A lot of people feel like Picquart
458.491	can't really be the hero of this story
464.515	because he was an anti-Semite
464.515	and that's bad, which I agree with.
469.323	But personally, for me,
469.323	the fact that Picquart was anti-Semitic
473.998	actually makes his actions more admirable,
476.607	because he had the same prejudices,
476.607	the same reasons to be biased
479.747	as his fellow officers,
481.556	but his motivation to find the truth
481.556	and uphold it trumped all of that.
487.108	So to me,
488.321	Picquart is a poster child
488.321	"for what I call ""scout mindset."""
492.598	It's the drive not to make
492.598	one idea win or another lose,
496.698	but just to see what's really there
498.646	as honestly and accurately as you can,
501.145	even if it's not pretty
501.145	or convenient or pleasant.
505.444	This mindset is what
505.444	I'm personally passionate about.
508.714	And I've spent the last few years
508.714	examining and trying to figure out
513.867	what causes scout mindset.
515.874	Why are some people, sometimes at least,
519.046	able to cut through their own prejudices
519.046	and biases and motivations
522.858	and just try to see the facts
522.858	and the evidence
525.177	as objectively as they can?
527.602	And the answer is emotional.
531.119	So, just as soldier mindset
531.119	is rooted in emotions
534.91	like defensiveness or tribalism,
538.615	scout mindset is, too.
540.005	It's just rooted in different emotions.
542.015	For example, scouts are curious.
545.458	They're more likely to say
545.458	they feel pleasure
549.028	when they learn new information
550.712	or an itch to solve a puzzle.
553.544	They're more likely to feel intrigued
553.544	when they encounter something
556.737	that contradicts their expectations.
559.206	Scouts also have different values.
561.207	They're more likely to say
561.207	they think it's virtuous
564.303	to test your own beliefs,
565.816	and they're less likely to say
565.816	that someone who changes his mind
569.546	seems weak.
570.832	And above all, scouts are grounded,
572.741	which means their self-worth as a person
576.67	isn't tied to how right or wrong
576.67	they are about any particular topic.
582.16	So they can believe
582.16	that capital punishment works.
585.438	If studies come out showing
585.438	that it doesn't, they can say,
588.275	"""Huh. Looks like I might be wrong."
588.275	"Doesn't mean I'm bad or stupid."""
593.954	This cluster of traits
593.954	is what researchers have found --
598.304	and I've also found anecdotally --
600.034	predicts good judgment.
602.386	And the key takeaway I want
602.386	to leave you with about those traits
605.693	is that they're primarily
605.693	not about how smart you are
609.354	or about how much you know.
611.376	In fact, they don't correlate
611.376	very much with IQ at all.
614.638	They're about how you feel.
616.849	There's a quote that I keep
616.849	coming back to, by Saint-Exupéry.
620.896	"He's the author of ""The Little Prince."""
622.861	"He said, ""If you want to build a ship,"
626.234	don't drum up your men
626.234	to collect wood and give orders
630.879	and distribute the work.
632.669	Instead, teach them to yearn
632.669	"for the vast and endless sea."""
638.252	In other words, I claim,
640.85	if we really want to improve
640.85	our judgment as individuals
644.034	and as societies,
645.501	what we need most
645.501	is not more instruction in logic
649.034	or rhetoric or probability or economics,
652.606	even though those things
652.606	are quite valuable.
654.713	But what we most need
654.713	to use those principles well
658.041	is scout mindset.
659.483	We need to change the way we feel.
661.759	We need to learn how to feel proud
661.759	instead of ashamed
665.593	when we notice we might
665.593	have been wrong about something.
668.255	We need to learn how to feel intrigued
668.255	instead of defensive
671.407	when we encounter some information
671.407	that contradicts our beliefs.
676.555	So the question I want
676.555	to leave you with is:
679.817	What do you most yearn for?
682.771	Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs?
686.128	Or do you yearn to see the world
686.128	as clearly as you possibly can?
690.352	Thank you.
691.527	(Applause)
