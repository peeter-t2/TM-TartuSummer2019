12.349	Living in Africa is to be on the edge,
15.543	metaphorically, and quite literally
18.297	when you think about connectivity before 2008.
21.929	Though many human intellectual and technological leaps
25.641	had happened in Europe and the rest of the world,
28.665	but Africa was sort of cut off.
31.254	And that changed, first with ships
33.881	when we had the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution
37.158	and also the Industrial Revolution.
39.259	And now we've got the digital revolution.
42.286	These revolutions have not been evenly distributed
45.286	across continents and nations.
47.619	Never have been.
50.349	Now, this is a map of the undersea fiber optic cables
54.114	that connect Africa to the rest of the world.
57.018	What I find amazing is that Africa
59.058	is transcending its geography problem.
61.868	Africa is connecting to the rest of the world
63.682	and within itself.
65.518	The connectivity situation has improved greatly,
68.794	but some barriers remain.
70.995	It is with this context that Ushahidi came to be.
74.683	In 2008, one of the problems that we faced
79.219	was lack of information flow.
81.757	There was a media blackout in 2008,
84.053	when there was post-election violence in Kenya.
86.429	It was a very tragic time. It was a very difficult time.
89.253	So we came together and we created software
92.003	called Ushahidi.
93.569	"And Ushahidi means ""testimony"" or ""witness"" in Swahili."
97.169	I'm very lucky to work with two amazing collaborators.
100.339	This is David and Erik.
102.445	I call them brothers from another mother.
104.517	Clearly I have a German mother somewhere.
107.529	And we worked together first with building
110.118	and growing Ushahidi.
111.566	And the idea of the software was to gather information
114.565	from SMS, email and web, and put a map
117.338	so that you could see what was happening where,
120.253	and you could visualize that data.
122.357	And after that initial prototype,
124.613	we set out to make free and open-source software
127.108	so that others do not have to start from scratch like we did.
131.959	All the while, we also wanted to give back
133.93	to the local tech community that helped us
136.162	grow Ushahidi and supported us in those early days.
139.667	And that's why we set up the iHub in Nairobi,
142.25	an actual physical space
144.274	where we could collaborate,
146.74	and it is now part of an integral tech ecosystem in Kenya.
151.297	We did that with the support of different organizations
154.067	like the MacArthur Foundation and Omidyar Network.
157.072	And we were able to grow this software footprint,
160.249	and a few years later it became
163.015	very useful software,
165.712	and we were quite humbled when it was used in Haiti
168.939	where citizens could indicate where they are
172.008	and what their needs were,
173.402	and also to deal with the fallout from the nuclear crisis
176.699	and the tsunami in Japan.
178.738	Now, this year the Internet turns 20,
182.132	and Ushahidi turned five.
184.414	Ushahidi is not only the software that we made.
187.215	It is the team, and it's also the community
190.272	that uses this technology in ways that we could not foresee.
194.557	We did not imagine that there would be this many maps
197.877	around the world.
199.388	There are crisis maps, election maps, corruption maps,
202.91	and even environmental monitoring crowd maps.
206.437	We are humbled that this has roots in Kenya
209.893	and that it has some use to people around the world
212.609	trying to figure out the different issues that they're dealing with.
215.96	There is more that we're doing to explore this idea
218.831	of collective intelligence, that I, as a citizen,
221.446	if I share the information with whatever device that I have,
224.382	could inform you about what is going on,
226.925	and that if you do the same, we can have a bigger picture
229.783	of what's going on.
231.627	I moved back to Kenya in 2011.
233.688	Erik moved in 2010.
235.836	Very different reality. I used to live in Chicago
237.983	where there was abundant Internet access.
240.133	I had never had to deal with a blackout.
242.965	And in Kenya, it's a very different reality,
245.849	and one thing that remains despite the leaps in progress
248.946	and the digital revolution is the electricity problem.
252.73	The day-to-day frustrations of dealing with this
255.501	can be, let's just say very annoying.
258.737	Blackouts are not fun.
260.702	Imagine sitting down to start working, and all of a sudden
263.615	the power goes out,
265.295	your Internet connection goes down with it,
267.97	so you have to figure out, okay, now, where's the modem,
271.618	how do I switch back?
273.607	And then, guess what? You have to deal with it again.
276.325	Now, this is the reality of Kenya, where we live now,
279.517	and other parts of Africa.
281.882	The other problem that we're facing
283.838	is that communication costs are also still a challenge.
288.125	It costs me five Kenyan shillings,
290.289	or .06 USD to call the U.S., Canada or China.
296.342	Guess how much it costs to call Rwanda, Ghana, Nigeria?
300.912	Thirty Kenyan shillings. That's six times the cost
304.186	to connect within Africa.
306.296	And also, when traveling within Africa,
308.43	you've got different settings for different mobile providers.
311.696	This is the reality that we deal with.
314.405	So we've got a joke in Ushahidi
317.02	"where we say, ""If it works in Africa, it'll work anywhere."""
321.818	[Most use technology to define the function. We use function to drive the technology.]
323.97	What if we could overcome the problem
326.216	of unreliable Internet and electricity
330.081	and reduce the cost of connection?
332.106	Could we leverage the cloud?
334.072	We've built a crowd map, we've built Ushahidi.
335.903	Could we leverage these technologies
338.328	to switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country?
343.393	So we looked at the modem,
344.691	an important part of the infrastructure of the Internet,
347.97	and asked ourselves why
350.481	the modems that we are using right now
352.436	are built for a different context, where you've got
354.66	ubiquitous internet, you've got ubiquitous electricity,
358.615	yet we sit here in Nairobi and we do not have that luxury.
363.652	We wanted to redesign the modem
366.149	for the developing world, for our context,
369.196	and for our reality.
371.107	What if we could have connectivity with less friction?
374.784	This is the BRCK.
378.313	It acts as a backup to the Internet
381.217	so that, when the power goes out,
384.994	it fails over and connects to the nearest GSM network.
391.142	Mobile connectivity in Africa is pervasive.
393.983	It's actually everywhere.
396.323	Most towns at least have a 3G connection.
399.251	So why don't we leverage that? And that's why we built this.
402.16	The other reason that we built this
404.358	is when electricity goes down, this has eight hours
406.944	of battery left, so you can continue working,
408.958	you can continue being productive,
411.046	and let's just say you are less stressed.
415.268	And for rural areas, it can be
417.598	the primary means of connection.
419.701	The software sensibility at Ushahidi is still at play
422.437	when we wondered how can we use the cloud
425.496	to be more intelligent so that
427.438	you can analyze the different networks,
429.823	and whenever you switch on the backup,
432.962	you pick on the fastest network,
435.471	so we'll have multi-SIM capability
437.87	so that you can put multiple SIMs,
439.966	and if one network is faster, that's the one you hop on,
443.38	and if the up time on that is not very good,
446.729	then you hop onto the next one.
449.144	The idea here is for you to be able to connect anywhere.
452.881	With load balancing, this can be possible.
455.769	The other interesting thing for us -- we like sensors --
459.622	is this idea that you could have an on-ramp
463.05	for the Internet of things.
464.977	Imagine a weather station that can be attached to this.
468.597	It's built in a modular way so that you can also attach
471.336	a satellite module so that you could have
473.106	Internet connectivity even in very remote areas.
476.631	Out of adversity can come innovation,
479.376	and how can we help the ambitious coders and makers
483.415	in Kenya to be resilient in the face of problematic infrastructure?
487.494	And for us, we begin with solving the problem
489.75	in our own backyard in Kenya.
492.694	It is not without challenge.
495.094	Our team has basically been mules carrying components
497.847	from the U.S. to Kenya. We've had very interesting conversations
501.041	with customs border agents.
502.969	"""What are you carrying?"""
504.767	And the local financing is not
507.537	part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects.
512.888	So we put it on Kickstarter, and I'm happy to say that,
515.607	through the support of many people,
517.848	not only here but online,
519.847	the BRCK has been Kickstarted,
522.102	and now the interesting part of bringing this to market begins.
526.192	I will close by saying that, if we solve this
529.086	for the local market, it could be impactful
531.646	not only for the coders in Nairobi
534.096	but also for small business owners
536.448	who need reliable connectivity,
539.112	and it can reduce the cost of connecting,
541.312	and hopefully collaboration within African countries.
545.992	The idea is that the building blocks of the digital economy
550.964	are connectivity and entrepreneurship.
554.483	The BRCK is our part
556.923	to keep Africans connected,
559.507	and to help them drive the global digital revolution.
563.291	Thank you.
564.505	(Applause)
