15.26	So what does the happiest man in the world look like?
20.26	He certainly doesn't look like me.
22.26	He looks like this.
25.26	His name is Matthieu Ricard.
27.26	So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world?
31.26	Well it turns out
33.26	there is a way to measure happiness in the brain.
36.26	And you do that by measuring the relative activation
39.26	of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI,
42.26	versus the right prefrontal cortex.
45.26	And Matthieu's happiness measure
47.26	is off the charts.
49.26	He's by far the happiest man
51.26	ever measured by science.
55.26	Which leads us to a question:
58.26	What was he thinking when he was being measured?
62.26	Perhaps something very naughty.
64.26	(Laughter)
66.26	Actually, he was meditating
68.26	on compassion.
71.26	Matthieu's own experience
73.26	is that compassion is the happiest state ever.
77.26	Reading about Matthieu
79.26	was one of the pivotal moments of my life.
82.26	My dream
84.26	is to create the conditions
86.26	for world peace in my lifetime --
88.26	and to do that
90.26	by creating the conditions
92.26	for inner peace
94.26	and compassion
96.26	on a global scale.
98.26	And learning about Matthieu
100.26	gave me a new angle to look at my work.
103.26	Matthieu's brain scan shows
105.26	that compassion is not a chore.
107.26	Compassion is something that creates happiness.
110.26	Compassion is fun.
114.26	And that mind-blowing insight
116.26	changes the entire game.
119.26	Because if compassion was a chore,
121.26	nobody's going to do it,
123.26	except maybe the Dalai Lama or something.
126.26	But if compassion was fun,
129.26	everybody's going to do it.
131.26	Therefore,
133.26	to create the conditions for global compassion,
136.26	all we have to do
139.26	is to reframe compassion
141.26	as something that is fun.
144.26	But fun is not enough.
147.26	What if compassion
149.26	is also profitable?
153.26	What if compassion is also good for business?
156.26	Then, every boss, every manager in the world,
159.26	will want to have compassion --
161.26	like this.
163.26	That would create the conditions
165.26	for world peace.
168.26	So, I started paying attention
171.26	to what compassion looks like in a business setting.
174.26	Fortunately, I didn't have to look very far.
177.26	Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes --
180.26	in Google, my company.
183.26	I know there are other compassionate companies in the world,
186.26	but Google is the place I'm familiar with
188.26	because I've been there for 10 years,
190.26	so I'll use Google as the case study.
193.26	Google is a company
195.26	born of idealism.
197.26	It's a company that thrives on idealism.
201.26	And maybe because of that,
203.26	compassion is organic
205.26	and widespread company-wide.
209.26	In Google, expressions of corporate compassion
212.26	almost always follow the same pattern.
214.26	It's sort of a funny pattern.
216.26	It starts with a small group of Googlers
219.26	taking the initiative to do something.
222.26	And they don't usually ask for permission;
224.26	they just go ahead and do it,
226.26	and then other Googlers join in, and it just gets bigger and bigger.
229.26	And sometimes it gets big enough
231.26	to become official.
233.26	So in other words,
235.26	it almost always starts from the bottom up.
238.26	And let me give you some examples.
240.26	The first example is the largest annual community event --
244.26	where Googlers from around the world
246.26	donate their labor to their local communities --
249.26	was initiated and organized
251.26	by three employees
253.26	before it became official,
255.26	because it just became too big.
257.26	Another example, three Googlers --
259.26	a chef, an engineer
262.26	and, most funny, a massage therapist --
265.26	three of them, they learned about a region in India
268.26	where 200,000 people live
270.26	without a single medical facility.
272.26	So what do they do?
274.26	They just go ahead and start a fundraiser.
277.26	And they raise enough money to build this hospital --
280.26	the first hospital of its kind
282.26	for 200,000 people.
284.26	During the Haiti earthquake,
286.26	a number of engineers and product managers
289.26	spontaneously came together
291.26	and stayed overnight
293.26	to build a tool
295.26	to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones.
299.26	And expressions of compassion
301.26	are also found in our international offices.
304.26	In China for example,
306.26	one mid-level employee
308.26	initiated the largest social action competition in China,
313.26	involving more than 1,000 schools in China,
315.26	working on issues
317.26	such as education, poverty,
319.26	health care and the environment.
323.26	There is so much organic social action
325.26	all around Google
327.26	that the company decided to form
329.26	a social responsibility team
331.26	just to support these efforts.
333.26	And this idea, again,
335.26	came from the grassroots,
337.26	from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions
340.26	and volunteered themselves for the job.
343.26	And I found it fascinating
345.26	that the social responsibility team
347.26	was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy.
350.26	"It was two persons saying, ""Let's do this,"""
353.26	"and the company said, ""Yes."""
357.26	So it turns out
359.26	that Google is a compassionate company,
361.26	because Googlers found
363.26	compassion to be fun.
366.26	But again, fun is not enough.
370.26	There are also real business benefits.
373.26	So what are they?
375.26	The first benefit of compassion
378.26	is that it creates highly effective business leaders.
383.26	What does that mean?
385.26	There are three components of compassion.
387.26	There is the affective component,
390.26	"which is, ""I feel for you."""
392.26	There is the cognitive component,
394.26	"which is, ""I understand you."""
396.26	And there is a motivational component,
398.26	"which is, ""I want to help you."""
402.26	So what has this got to do with business leadership?
406.26	According to a very comprehensive study
408.26	led by Jim Collins,
410.26	"and documented in the book ""Good to Great,"""
413.26	it takes a very special kind of leader
416.26	to bring a company
418.26	from goodness to greatness.
421.26	"And he calls them ""Level 5 leaders."""
424.26	These are leaders
426.26	who, in addition to being highly capable,
429.26	possess two important qualities,
432.26	and they are
434.26	humility and ambition.
437.26	These are leaders
439.26	who are highly ambitious for the greater good.
442.26	And because they're ambitious for a greater good,
444.26	they feel no need to inflate their own egos.
447.26	And they, according to the research,
449.26	make the best business leaders.
453.26	And if you look at these qualities
455.26	in the context of compassion,
457.26	we find
459.26	that the cognitive and affective components of compassion --
463.26	understanding people and empathizing with people --
467.26	inhibits, tones down,
470.26	what I call the excessive self-obsession that's in us,
474.26	therefore creating the conditions
476.26	for humility.
479.26	The motivational component of compassion
482.26	creates ambition for greater good.
485.26	In other words,
487.26	compassion is the way to grow Level 5 leaders.
491.26	And this is the first compelling business benefit.
495.26	The second compelling benefit of compassion
498.26	is that it creates an inspiring workforce.
502.26	Employees mutually inspire each other
505.26	towards greater good.
507.26	It creates a vibrant, energetic community
509.26	where people admire and respect each other.
512.26	I mean, you come to work in the morning,
514.26	and you work with three guys
516.26	who just up and decide to build a hospital in India.
520.26	It's like how can you not be inspired by those people --
523.26	your own coworkers?
526.26	So this mutual inspiration
528.26	promotes collaboration,
530.26	initiative and creativity.
532.26	It makes us a highly effective company.
536.26	So, having said all that,
538.26	what is the secret formula
540.26	for brewing compassion
543.26	in the corporate setting?
545.26	In our experience,
547.26	there are three ingredients.
549.26	The first ingredient
551.26	is to create a culture
554.26	of passionate concern
556.26	for the greater good.
558.26	So always think:
560.26	how is your company and your job
563.26	serving the greater good?
565.26	Or, how can you further serve
567.26	the greater good?
569.26	This awareness of serving the greater good
572.26	is very self-inspiring
574.26	and it creates fertile ground
576.26	for compassion to grow in.
578.26	That's one.
580.26	The second ingredient
582.26	is autonomy.
584.26	So in Google, there's a lot of autonomy.
587.26	And one of our most popular managers jokes that,
589.26	this is what he says,
591.26	"""Google is a place"
593.26	"where the inmates run the asylum."""
596.26	And he considers himself one of the inmates.
599.26	If you already have
601.26	a culture of compassion
603.26	and idealism
605.26	and you let your people roam free,
607.26	they will do the right thing
609.26	in the most compassionate way.
612.26	The third ingredient
614.26	is to focus on inner development
617.26	and personal growth.
619.26	Leadership training in Google, for example,
622.26	places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities,
625.26	such as self-awareness, self-mastery,
628.26	empathy and compassion,
631.26	because we believe
633.26	that leadership begins
635.26	with character.
638.26	We even created a seven-week curriculum
640.26	on emotion intelligence,
642.26	"which we jokingly call ""Searching Inside Yourself."""
646.26	It's less naughty than it sounds.
650.26	So I'm an engineer by training,
652.26	but I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course,
656.26	which I find kind of funny,
658.26	because this is a company that trusts an engineer
660.26	to teach emotion intelligence.
662.26	What a company.
664.26	(Laughter)
666.26	"So ""Search Inside Yourself"" -- how does it work?"
669.26	It works in three steps.
671.26	The first step
673.26	is attention training.
675.26	Attention is the basis
678.26	of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities.
684.26	Therefore, any curriculum
686.26	for training emotion intelligence
688.26	has to begin with attention training.
692.26	The idea here is to train attention
695.26	to create a quality of mind
697.26	that is calm and clear
699.26	at the same time.
702.26	And this creates the foundation
704.26	for emotion intelligence.
707.26	The second step follows the first step.
710.26	The second step is developing self-knowledge
713.26	and self-mastery.
715.26	So using the supercharged attention from step one,
719.26	we create a high-resolution perception
722.26	into the cognitive and emotive processes.
725.26	What does that mean?
727.26	It means being able to observe our thought stream
731.26	and the process of emotion
733.26	with high clarity,
735.26	objectivity
737.26	and from a third-person perspective.
740.26	And once you can do that,
742.26	you create the kind of self-knowledge
744.26	that enables self-mastery.
748.26	The third step, following the second step,
751.26	is to create new mental habits.
753.26	What does that mean? Imagine this.
756.26	Imagine whenever you meet any other person,
759.26	any time you meet a person,
761.26	your habitual, instinctive first thought
764.26	"is, ""I want you to be happy."
766.26	"I want you to be happy."""
768.26	Imagine you can do that.
770.26	Having this habit, this mental habit,
772.26	changes everything at work.
775.26	Because this good will
777.26	is unconsciously picked up by other people,
780.26	and it creates trust,
783.26	and trust creates a lot of good working relationships.
787.26	And this also creates the conditions
789.26	for compassion in the workplace.
792.26	Someday, we hope to open-source
795.26	"""Search Inside Yourself"""
797.26	so that everybody in the corporate world
800.26	will at least be able to use it as a reference.
804.26	And in closing,
806.26	I want to end the same place I started,
808.26	with happiness.
810.26	I want to quote this guy -- the guy in robes, not the other guy --
814.26	the Dalai Lama,
816.26	"who said, ""If you want others to be happy,"
818.26	practice compassion.
820.26	If you want to be happy,
822.26	"practice compassion."""
824.26	I found this to be true,
826.26	both on the individual level
828.26	and at a corporate level.
830.26	And I hope that compassion
832.26	will be both fun and profitable for you too.
834.26	Thank you.
836.26	(Applause)
