25	If you take 10,000 people at random, 9,999 have something in common:
31	their interests in business lie on or near the Earth's surface.
36	The odd one out is an astronomer, and I am one of that strange breed.
40	(Laughter)
41	My talk will be in two parts. I'll talk first as an astronomer,
46	and then as a worried member of the human race.
50	But let's start off by remembering that Darwin showed
55	how we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution.
59	And what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology
62	is to go back before Darwin's simple beginning,
65	to set our Earth in a cosmic context.
69	And let me just run through a few slides.
72	This was the impact that happened last week on a comet.
77	If they'd sent a nuke, it would have been rather more spectacular
79	than what actually happened last Monday.
82	So that's another project for NASA.
84	That's Mars from the European Mars Express, and at New Year.
89	This artist's impression turned into reality
94	when a parachute landed on Titan, Saturn's giant moon.
98	It landed on the surface. This is pictures taken on the way down.
102	That looks like a coastline.
103	It is indeed, but the ocean is liquid methane --
106	the temperature minus 170 degrees centigrade.
111	If we go beyond our solar system,
113	we've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light.
117	Each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it.
122	And we can see places where stars are forming,
125	like the Eagle Nebula. We see stars dying.
128	In six billion years, the sun will look like that.
131	And some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion,
135	leaving remnants like that.
137	On a still bigger scale, we see entire galaxies of stars.
141	We see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled.
144	And to the cosmologist,
146	these galaxies are just the atoms, as it were, of the large-scale universe.
152	This picture shows a patch of sky
155	so small that it would take about 100 patches like it
158	to cover the full moon in the sky.
161	Through a small telescope, this would look quite blank,
163	but you see here hundreds of little, faint smudges.
167	Each is a galaxy, fully like ours or Andromeda,
171	which looks so small and faint because its light
173	has taken 10 billion light-years to get to us.
177	The stars in those galaxies probably don't have planets around them.
182	There's scant chance of life there -- that's because there's been no time
185	for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron,
191	the building blocks of planets and of life.
195	We believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang --
201	a hot, dense state. So how did that amorphous Big Bang
205	turn into our complex cosmos?
207	I'm going to show you a movie simulation
212	which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out.
216	But you see, as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom,
220	you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds
223	on small, dense irregularities, and structures develop.
227	And we'll end up after 13 billion years
229	with something looking rather like our own universe.
236	And we compare simulated universes like that --
239	I'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk --
241	with what we actually see in the sky.
245	Well, we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the Big Bang,
251	but we still don't know what banged and why it banged.
255	That's a challenge for 21st-century science.
260	If my research group had a logo, it would be this picture here:
263	an ouroboros, where you see the micro-world on the left --
268	the world of the quantum -- and on the right
271	the large-scale universe of planets, stars and galaxies.
276	We know our universes are united though --
278	links between left and right.
280	The everyday world is determined by atoms,
282	how they stick together to make molecules.
284	Stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together.
290	And, as we've learned in the last few years, galaxies are held together
293	by the gravitational pull of so-called dark matter:
296	particles in huge swarms, far smaller even than atomic nuclei.
302	But we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top.
308	The micro-world of the quantum is understood.
311	On the right hand side, gravity holds sway. Einstein explained that.
316	But the unfinished business for 21st-century science
319	is to link together cosmos and micro-world
321	with a unified theory -- symbolized, as it were, gastronomically
325	at the top of that picture. (Laughter)
327	And until we have that synthesis,
329	we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe
332	because when our universe was itself the size of an atom,
335	quantum effects could shake everything.
338	And so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small,
342	which we don't yet have.
345	One idea, incidentally --
347	and I had this hazard sign to say I'm going to speculate from now on --
352	is that our Big Bang was not the only one.
354	One idea is that our three-dimensional universe
358	may be embedded in a high-dimensional space,
360	just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper.
363	You can imagine ants on one of them
365	thinking it's a two-dimensional universe,
367	not being aware of another population of ants on the other.
369	So there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours,
373	but we're not aware of it because that millimeter
376	is measured in some fourth spatial dimension,
378	and we're imprisoned in our three.
380	And so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality
385	than what we've normally called our universe --
387	the aftermath of our Big Bang. And here's another picture.
390	Bottom right depicts our universe,
392	which on the horizon is not beyond that,
394	but even that is just one bubble, as it were, in some vaster reality.
399	Many people suspect that just as we've gone from believing
402	in one solar system to zillions of solar systems,
406	one galaxy to many galaxies,
408	we have to go to many Big Bangs from one Big Bang,
412	perhaps these many Big Bangs displaying
414	an immense variety of properties.
416	Well, let's go back to this picture.
418	There's one challenge symbolized at the top,
421	but there's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom.
425	You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small,
428	but we want to understand the very complex.
431	And the most complex things are ourselves,
433	midway between atoms and stars.
435	We depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of.
437	We depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure.
443	We clearly have to be large, compared to atoms,
446	to have layer upon layer of complex structure.
448	We clearly have to be small, compared to stars and planets --
451	otherwise we'd be crushed by gravity. And in fact, we are midway.
455	It would take as many human bodies to make up the sun
457	as there are atoms in each of us.
459	The geometric mean of the mass of a proton
461	and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms,
464	within a factor of two of the mass of each person here.
467	Well, most of you anyway.
468	The science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all,
473	greater than that of the very small on the left
475	and the very large on the right.
478	And it's this science,
480	which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world,
484	but also transforming our world faster than ever.
488	And more than that, it's engendering new kinds of change.
492	And I now move on to the second part of my talk,
497	"and the book ""Our Final Century"" was mentioned."
501	If I was not a self-effacing Brit, I would mention the book myself,
505	and I would add that it's available in paperback.
508	(Laughter)
511	"And in America it was called ""Our Final Hour"""
514	because Americans like instant gratification.
516	(Laughter)
518	But my theme is that in this century,
521	not only has science changed the world faster than ever,
524	but in new and different ways.
527	Targeted drugs, genetic modification, artificial intelligence,
531	perhaps even implants into our brains,
533	may change human beings themselves. And human beings,
536	their physique and character, has not changed for thousands of years.
540	It may change this century.
542	It's new in our history.
544	And the human impact on the global environment -- greenhouse warming,
547	mass extinctions and so forth -- is unprecedented, too.
551	And so, this makes this coming century a challenge.
556	Bio- and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign
559	in that they offer marvelous prospects,
561	while, nonetheless, reducing pressure on energy and resources.
565	But they will have a dark side.
568	In our interconnected world, novel technology could empower
572	just one fanatic,
574	or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses,
578	to trigger some kind on disaster.
580	Indeed, catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure --
584	error rather than terror.
586	And even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable
591	when the downside could be of global consequence.
596	In fact, some years ago, Bill Joy wrote an article
600	expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over, etc.
604	I don't go along with all that,
605	but it's interesting that he had a simple solution.
607	"It was what he called ""fine-grained relinquishment."""
610	He wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science
613	and keep the good bits. Now, that's absurdly naive for two reasons.
617	First, any scientific discovery has benign consequences
621	as well as dangerous ones.
623	And also, when a scientist makes a discovery,
626	he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be.
630	And so what this means is that we have to accept the risks
635	if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science.
639	We have to accept that there will be hazards.
642	And I think we have to go back to what happened in the post-War era,
648	post-World War II, when the nuclear scientists
651	who'd been involved in making the atomic bomb,
653	in many cases were concerned that they should do all they could
657	to alert the world to the dangers.
659	And they were inspired not by the young Einstein,
663	who did the great work in relativity, but by the old Einstein,
668	the icon of poster and t-shirt,
671	who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws.
675	He was premature. But he was a moral compass --
678	an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control.
683	And perhaps the greatest living person
685	is someone I'm privileged to know, Joe Rothblatt.
688	Equally untidy office there, as you can see.
691	He's 96 years old, and he founded the Pugwash movement.
695	He persuaded Einstein, as his last act,
697	to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell.
700	And he sets an example of the concerned scientist.
705	And I think to harness science optimally,
708	to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed,
711	we need latter-day counterparts of people like Joseph Rothblatt.
716	We need not just campaigning physicists,
718	but we need biologists, computer experts
720	and environmentalists as well.
723	And I think academics and independent entrepreneurs
726	have a special obligation because they have more freedom
728	than those in government service,
730	or company employees subject to commercial pressure.
733	"I wrote my book, ""Our Final Century,"" as a scientist,"
738	just a general scientist. But there's one respect, I think,
741	in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective,
745	and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future.
749	The stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past
752	are now part of common culture --
755	outside the American Bible Belt, anyway --
758	(Laughter)
759	but most people, even those who are familiar with evolution,
763	aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead.
767	The sun has been shining for four and a half billion years,
770	but it'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out.
774	On that schematic picture, a sort of time-lapse picture, we're halfway.
780	And it'll be another six billion before that happens,
785	and any remaining life on Earth is vaporized.
790	There's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there,
793	experiencing the sun's demise,
795	but any life and intelligence that exists then
798	will be as different from us as we are from bacteria.
802	The unfolding of intelligence and complexity
804	still has immensely far to go, here on Earth and probably far beyond.
810	So we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity
813	in our Earth and beyond.
816	If you represent the Earth's lifetime by a single year,
820	say from January when it was made to December,
823	the 21st-century would be a quarter of a second in June --
829	a tiny fraction of the year.
832	But even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective,
836	our century is very, very special,
839	the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet.
844	As I should have shown this earlier,
847	it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun;
850	it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria.
855	When Einstein died in 1955,
858	one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon
861	by Herblock in the Washington Post.
863	"The plaque reads, ""Albert Einstein lived here."""
867	And I'd like to end with a vignette, as it were, inspired by this image.
871	We've been familiar for 40 years with this image:
877	the fragile beauty of land, ocean and clouds,
880	contrasted with the sterile moonscape
882	on which the astronauts left their footprints.
886	But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot
890	in the cosmos from afar, not just for 40 years,
894	but for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our Earth.
899	What would they have seen?
901	Over nearly all that immense time,
903	Earth's appearance would have changed very gradually.
906	The only abrupt worldwide change
908	would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions.
914	Apart from those brief traumas, nothing happens suddenly.
918	The continental landmasses drifted around.
921	Ice cover waxed and waned.
923	Successions of new species emerged, evolved and became extinct.
927	But in just a tiny sliver of the Earth's history,
931	the last one-millionth part, a few thousand years,
935	the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before.
938	This signaled the start of agriculture.
941	Change has accelerated as human populations rose.
945	Then other things happened even more abruptly.
947	Within just 50 years --
949	that's one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth's age --
953	the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise,
957	and ominously fast.
959	The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves --
961	the total output from all TV and cell phones
965	and radar transmissions. And something else happened.
968	Metallic objects -- albeit very small ones, a few tons at most --
973	escaped into orbit around the Earth.
976	Some journeyed to the moons and planets.
978	A race of advanced extraterrestrials
980	watching our solar system from afar
983	could confidently predict Earth's final doom in another six billion years.
988	But could they have predicted this unprecedented spike
992	less than halfway through the Earth's life?
995	These human-induced alterations
997	occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime
1001	and seemingly occurring with runaway speed?
1004	If they continued their vigil,
1006	what might these hypothetical aliens witness
1008	in the next hundred years?
1011	Will some spasm foreclose Earth's future?
1014	Or will the biosphere stabilize?
1017	Or will some of the metallic objects launched from the Earth
1020	spawn new oases, a post-human life elsewhere?
1024	The science done by the young Einstein will continue
1027	as long as our civilization, but for civilization to survive,
1032	we'll need the wisdom of the old Einstein --
1034	humane, global and farseeing.
1036	And whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century
1041	will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the Earth,
1047	far beyond the Earth as depicted here.
1049	Thank you very much.
1051	(Applause)
