12.951	My grandfather was a cobbler.
16.66	Back in the day, he made custom-made shoes.
19.899	I never got to meet him.
22.11	He perished in the Holocaust.
24.91	But I did inherit his love for making,
28.988	except that it doesn't exist that much anymore.
32.926	You see, while the Industrial Revolution
35.436	did a great deal to improve humanity,
38.179	it eradicated the very skill
41.116	that my grandfather loved,
44.136	and it atrophied craftsmanship as we know it.
47.437	But all of that is about to change with 3D printing,
52.74	and it all started with this,
57.818	the very first part
59.65	that was ever printed.
61.91	It's a little older than TED.
64.473	It was printed in 1983
67.12	by Chuck Hull,
69.84	who invented 3D printing.
73.448	But the thing that I want to talk to you about today,
75.631	the big idea that I want to discuss with you,
77.561	is not that 3D printing
79.464	is going to catapult us into the future,
82.724	but rather that it's actually going
85.12	to connect us with our heritage,
88.213	and it's going to usher in a new era
91.237	of localized, distributed manufacturing
95.121	that is actually based
96.853	on digital fabrication.
99.312	So think about useful things.
105.11	You all know your shoe size.
106.953	How many of you know the size
108.631	of the bridge of your nose
110.116	or the distance between your temples?
113.379	Anybody?
115.91	Wouldn't it be awesome if you could,
117.708	for the first time, get eyewear
119.98	that actually fits you perfectly
123.19	and doesn't require any hinge assembly,
126.865	so chances are, the hinges are not going to break?
130.422	But the implications of 3D printing
133.02	go well beyond the tips of our noses.
136.477	When I met Amanda for the first time,
138.805	she could already stand up and walk a little bit
141.4	even though she was paralyzed from the waist down,
144.355	but she complained to me that her suit
147.07	was uncomfortable.
148.995	It was a beautiful robotic suit
150.446	made by Ekso Bionics,
152.134	but it wasn't inspired by her body.
155.902	It wasn't made to measure.
158.219	So she challenged me to make her something
160.942	that was a little bit more feminine,
164.103	a little bit more elegant,
167.331	and lightweight,
168.585	and like good tailors,
170.117	we thought that we would measure her digitally.
174.497	And we did. We built her an amazing suit.
177.586	The incredible part about what I learned
180.594	from Amanda is a lot of us are looking at 3D printing
183.744	and we say to ourselves,
185.442	it's going to replace traditional methods.
188.3	Amanda looked at it and she said,
190.28	it's an opportunity for me
192.17	to reclaim my symmetry
194.375	and to embrace my authenticity.
197.353	And you know what? She's not standing still.
199.482	She now wants to walk in high heels.
204.94	It doesn't stop there.
206.339	3D printing is changing
209.29	personalized medical devices as we know them,
212.641	from new, beautiful, conformal,
217.086	ventilated scoliosis braces
220.167	to millions of dental restorations
223.529	and to beautiful bracings
227.026	for amputees,
230.189	another opportunity to emotionally reconnect
233.361	with your symmetry.
235.881	And as we sit here today,
238.332	you can go wireless on your braces
241.179	with clear aligners,
243.26	or your dental restorations.
245.399	Millions of in-the-ear hearing aids
247.591	are already 3D printed today.
250.358	Millions of people are served today
252.723	from these devices.
255.419	What about full knee replacements,
259.179	from your data, made to measure,
262.246	where all of the tools and guides are 3D printed?
266.708	G.E. is using 3D printing
270.216	to make the next generation LEAP engine
272.894	that will save fuel to the tune
276.59	of about 15 percent
279.306	and cost for an airline
281.498	of about 14 million dollars.
283.893	Good for G.E., right?
285.575	And their customers and the environment.
288.108	But, you know, the even better news
290.568	is that this technology is no longer reserved
293.799	for deep-pocketed corporations.
296.465	Planetary Resources, a startup
299.7	for space explorations
301.194	is going to put out its first 
301.194	space probe later this year.
305.75	It was a fraction of a NASA spaceship,
309.2	it costs a fraction of its cost,
312.669	and it's made with less than a dozen moving parts,
316.36	and it's going to be out in space later this year.
320.039	Google is taking on this very audacious project
323.402	of making the block phone, the Ara.
326.104	It's only possible because of the development
328.617	of high-speed 3D printing that for the first time
331.166	will make functional, usable modules
335.526	that will go into it.
336.922	A real moonshot, powered by 3D printing.
340.22	How about food?
342.768	What if we could, for the first time,
345.292	make incredible delectables
348.279	like this beautiful TED Teddy here,
353	that are edible?
354.826	What if we could completely
354.826	change the experience,
358.51	like you see with that absinthe serving
362.315	that is completely 3D printed?
366.065	And what if we could begin to put ingredients
370.868	and colors and flavors in every taste,
374.309	which means not only delicious foods
377.107	but the promise of personalized nutrition
380.924	around the corner?
382.278	And that gets me to one of the
382.278	biggest deals about 3D printing.
385.423	With 3D printing, complexity is free.
388.284	The printer doesn't care
391.146	if it makes the most rudimentary shape
393.79	or the most complex shape,
395.99	and that is completely turning design
399.148	and manufacturing on its head as we know it.
402.694	Many people think that 3D printing will be
405.021	the end of manufacturing as we know it.
408.759	I think that it's the opportunity to put
411.272	tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters
414.933	that will create endless abundance
417.536	of job opportunities,
419.456	and with that,
421.42	everybody can become an expert maker
424.314	and an expert manufacturer.
426.418	That will take new tools.
428.304	Not everybody knows how to use CAD,
431.037	so we're developing haptics,
433.08	perceptual devices
435.019	that will allow you to touch
436.92	and feel your designs
438.685	as if you play with digital clay.
441.563	When you do things like that,
443.26	and we also developed things that take
445.263	physical photographs that are instantly printable,
447.817	it will make it easier to create content,
450.467	but with all of the unimagined,
453.498	we will also have the unintended,
455.89	like democratized counterfeiting
461.166	and ubiquitous illegal possession.
464.15	So many people ask me,
465.633	will we have a 3D printer in every home?
468.141	I think it's the wrong question to ask.
470.394	The right question to ask is,
471.775	how will 3D printing change my life?
475.54	Or, in other words, what room in my house
477.73	will 3D printing fit in?
479.894	So everything that you see here
481.89	has been 3D printed,
484.001	including these shoes
487.08	at the Amsterdam fashion show.
489.322	Now, these are not my grandfather's shoes.
493.018	These are shoes that represent
494.71	the continuation of his passion
496.908	for hyper-local manufacturing.
499.288	My grandfather didn't get to see Nike
504.531	printing cleats for the recent Super Bowl,
509.08	and my father didn't get to see me standing
512.487	in my hybridized 3D printed shoes.
515.597	He passed away three years ago.
518.348	But Chuck Hull, the man that invented it all,
521.591	is right here in the house today,
523.96	and thanks to him,
525.742	I can say, thanks to his invention, I can say
528.46	that I am a cobbler too,
530.437	and by standing in these shoes
532.891	I am honoring my past
535.225	while manufacturing the future.
537.377	Thank you.
538.9	(Applause)
