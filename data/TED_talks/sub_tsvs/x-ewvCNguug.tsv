25.301	I'd like to talk today
25.301	about the two biggest social trends
30.523	in the coming century,
32	and perhaps in the next 10,000 years.
35.159	But I want to start
35.159	with my work on romantic love,
39	because that's my most recent work.
41.222	What I and my colleagues did was put
46	into a functional MRI brain scanner.
	and their love was accepted;
51.241	and 15 who were madly in love
51.241	and they had just been dumped.
55.032	And so I want to tell you
55.032	about that first,
57.374	and then go on into where
57.374	I think love is going.
61.689	(Laughter)
63.483	"""What 'tis to love?"" Shakespeare said."
67.538	I think our ancestors --
69.48	I think human beings have been
69.48	wondering about this question
73.402	since they sat around their campfires
75.202	or lay and watched
75.202	the stars a million years ago.
79.928	I started out by trying to figure out
79.928	what romantic love was
83.183	by looking at the last 45 years
83.183	of the psychological research
88.69	and as it turns out,
90.021	there's a very specific group of things
90.021	that happen when you fall in love.
94.568	The first thing that happens is,
97	a person begins to take on
97	"what I call, ""special meaning."""
100.553	As a truck driver once said to me,
102.219	"""The world had a new center,"
102.219	"and that center was Mary Anne."""
106.801	George Bernard Shaw said it differently.
108.785	"""Love consists of overestimating"
108.785	the differences
111.277	"between one woman and another."""
113.309	And indeed, that's what we do.
115.595	(Laughter)
118.873	And then you just focus on this person.
121.493	You can list what you
121.493	don't like about them,
124.334	but then you sweep that aside
124.334	and focus on what you do.
127.922	"As Chaucer said, ""Love is blind."""
131.53	In trying to understand romantic love,
133.715	I decided I would read poetry
133.715	from all over the world,
136.716	and I just want to give
136.716	you one very short poem
139.392	from eighth-century China,
140.663	because it's an almost perfect example
142.896	of a man who is focused totally
142.896	on a particular woman.
146.824	It's a little bit like when you are
146.824	madly in love with somebody
149.888	and you walk into a parking lot --
151.55	their car is different
151.55	from every other car in the parking lot.
154.954	Their wine glass at dinner
156.484	is different from every other wine glass
156.484	at the dinner party.
160	And in this case, a man got hooked
160	on a bamboo sleeping mat.
164.312	And it goes like this.
165.535	It's by a guy called Yuan Zhen.
168.423	"""I cannot bear to put away"
168.423	the bamboo sleeping mat.
171.637	The night I brought you home,
171.637	"I watched you roll it out."""
175.468	He became hooked on a sleeping mat,
177.849	probably because of elevated activity
177.849	of dopamine in his brain,
180.849	just like with you and me.
182.294	But anyway, not only does this person
182.294	take on special meaning,
185.483	you focus your attention on them.
187.953	You aggrandize them.
189.578	But you have intense energy.
191.363	As one Polynesian said,
191.363	"""I felt like jumping in the sky."""
195.406	You're up all night.
195.406	You're walking till dawn.
198.627	You feel intense elation
198.627	when things are going well;
201.61	mood swings into horrible despair
201.61	when things are going poorly.
205.183	Real dependence on this person.
207.661	As one businessman in New York said to me,
210.084	"""Anything she liked, I liked."""
212.524	Simple. Romantic love is very simple.
215.793	You become extremely sexually possessive.
218	You know, if you're just sleeping
218	with somebody casually,
220.755	you don't really care
220.755	if they're sleeping with somebody else.
223.649	But the moment you fall in love,
225.227	you become extremely
225.227	sexually possessive of them.
227.547	I think there's a Darwinian
227.547	purpose to this.
231	The whole point of this
231	is to pull two people together
233.657	strongly enough to begin
233.657	to rear babies as a team.
238	But the main characteristics
238	of romantic love are craving:
241	an intense craving
241	to be with a particular person,
244.446	not just sexually, but emotionally.
246.693	It would be nice to go to bed with them,
250.445	but you want them to call you
250.445	on the telephone, to invite you out, etc.,
254.701	to tell you that they love you.
257.46	The other main characteristic
257.46	is motivation.
262.206	The motor in the brain begins to crank,
262.206	and you want this person.
266	And last but not least,
266	it is an obsession.
269.174	Before I put these people
269.174	in the MRI machine,
273	I would ask them all kinds of questions.
275	But my most important question
275	was always the same.
278.189	"It was: ""What percentage of the day"
278.189	"and night do you think about this person?"""
283	And indeed, they would say,
284.914	"""All day. All night."
287.095	I can never stop thinking
287.095	"about him or her."""
290	And then, the very last question --
291.834	I would always have to work
291.834	myself up to this question,
294.457	because I'm not a psychologist.
296.048	I don't work with people
296.048	in any kind of traumatic situation.
299.394	My final question was always the same.
301.323	I would say,
301.323	"""Would you die for him or her?"""
304.465	"And, indeed, these people would say ""Yes!"""
306.56	as if I had asked them to pass the salt.
308.695	I was just staggered by it.
312.634	So we scanned their brains,
315.244	looking at a photograph
315.244	of their sweetheart
317.378	and looking at a neutral photograph,
319.17	with a distraction task in between.
321.028	So we could look at the same brain
321.028	when it was in that heightened state
326	and when it was in a resting state.
328.869	And we found activity
328.869	in a lot of brain regions.
331.164	In fact, one of the most important
331.164	was a brain region
333.846	that becomes active
333.846	when you feel the rush of cocaine.
337.657	And indeed, that's exactly what happens.
340.65	I began to realize that romantic love
340.65	is not an emotion.
345.293	In fact, I had always thought
345.293	it was a series of emotions,
348.173	from very high to very low.
349.903	But actually, it's a drive.
351.633	It comes from the motor of the mind,
353.792	the wanting part of the mind,
353.792	the craving part of the mind.
357.481	The kind of part of the mind
359	when you're reaching
359	for that piece of chocolate,
361.664	when you want to win
361.664	that promotion at work.
365.906	The motor of the brain.
367.469	It's a drive.
368.697	And in fact, I think it's more powerful
368.697	than the sex drive.
372.166	You know, if you ask somebody
372.166	to go to bed with you,
374.673	"and they say, ""No, thank you,"""
376.134	you certainly don't kill yourself
376.134	or slip into a clinical depression.
379.675	But certainly, around the world,
382.892	people who are rejected
382.892	in love will kill for it.
387.349	People live for love.
388.508	They kill for love.
389.792	They die for love.
391.277	They have songs, poems, novels,
394.879	sculptures, paintings, myths, legends.
398.847	In over 175 societies,
401.02	people have left their evidence
401.02	of this powerful brain system.
405.828	I have come to think
406.875	it's one of the most powerful
406.875	brain systems on Earth
409.487	for both great joy and great sorrow.
412.659	And I've also come to think
414.121	that it's one of three
414.121	basically different brain systems
417.628	that evolved from mating and reproduction.
420.072	One is the sex drive:
420.072	the craving for sexual gratification.
423.555	W.H. Auden called it
423.555	"an ""intolerable neural itch,"""
427	and indeed, that's what it is.
430.142	It keeps bothering you
430.142	a little bit, like being hungry.
433.904	The second of these three brain
433.904	systems is romantic love:
436.874	that elation, obsession of early love.
439	And the third brain system is attachment:
441.38	that sense of calm and security
441.38	you can feel for a long-term partner.
445.698	And I think that the sex drive
445.698	evolved to get you out there,
448.534	looking for a whole range of partners.
451.113	You can feel it when you're just
451.113	driving along in your car.
453.922	It can be focused on nobody.
455.318	I think romantic love evolved
455.318	to enable you to focus your mating energy
459	on just one individual at a time,
461	thereby conserving mating time and energy.
463.856	And I think that attachment,
463.856	the third brain system,
466.61	evolved to enable you to tolerate
466.61	this human being
470.176	at least long enough to raise
470.176	a child together as a team.
476	So with that preamble,
477.522	I want to go into discussing
477.522	the two most profound social trends.
484	One of the last 10,000 years
486.307	and the other,
486.307	certainly of the last 25 years,
491.028	that are going to have an impact
491.028	on these three different brain systems:
495.304	lust, romantic love
495.304	and deep attachment to a partner.
499.262	The first is women working,
499.262	moving into the workforce.
506.333	I've looked at 130 societies
509.248	through the demographic yearbooks
509.248	of the United Nations.
511.913	Everywhere in the world,
516.669	women are not only moving
516.669	into the job market --
519	sometimes very, very slowly,
519	but they are moving into the job market --
523	and they are very slowly closing
523	that gap between men and women
526.878	in terms of economic power,
526.878	health and education.
530.699	It's very slow.
531.859	For every trend on this planet,
531.859	there's a counter-trend.
535	We all know of them, but nevertheless --
537.337	"the Arabs say, ""The dogs may bark,"
537.337	"but the caravan moves on."""
543.757	And, indeed, that caravan is moving on.
546.108	Women are moving back into the job market.
548.819	And I say back into the job market,
548.819	because this is not new.
552.323	For millions of years,
552.323	on the grasslands of Africa,
556.013	women commuted to work
556.013	to gather their vegetables.
559.187	They came home with 60 to 80 percent
559.187	of the evening meal.
562.871	The double income family was the standard.
565.783	And women were regarded
565.783	as just as economically,
569.237	socially and sexually powerful as men.
573	In short, we're really
573	moving forward to the past.
577.223	Then, women's worst
577.223	invention was the plow.
582.54	With the beginning of plow agriculture,
582.54	men's roles became extremely powerful.
586.238	Women lost their ancient
586.238	jobs as collectors,
590.698	but then with the industrial revolution
590.698	and the post-industrial revolution
594.401	they're moving back into the job market.
596.368	In short, they are acquiring the status
596.368	that they had a million years ago,
604.767	We are seeing now one
604.767	of the most remarkable traditions
609.362	in the history of the human animal.
613.666	And it's going to have an impact.
615.286	I generally give a whole lecture
616.843	on the impact of women
616.843	on the business community.
619.171	I'll say just a couple of things,
619.171	and then go on to sex and love.
622.252	There's a lot of gender differences;
624.133	anybody who thinks men and women are alike
626.333	simply never had a boy and a girl child.
628.299	I don't know why they want to think
628.299	that men and women are alike.
631.516	There's much we have in common,
633.063	but there's a whole lot
633.063	that we do not have in common.
636	We are -- in the words of Ted Hughes,
638	"""I think that we are like two feet."
638	"We need each other to get ahead."""
643.128	But we did not evolve
643.128	to have the same brain.
646	And we're finding more and more
646	gender differences in the brain.
649.473	I'll only just use a couple
649.473	and then move on to sex and love.
652.624	One of them is women's verbal ability.
654.755	Women can talk.
656	Women's ability to find the right word
656	rapidly, basic articulation
660	goes up in the middle
660	of the menstrual cycle,
662.402	when estrogen levels peak.
663.997	But even at menstruation,
663.997	they're better than the average man.
668.099	Women can talk.
669.655	They've been doing it for a million years;
669.655	words were women's tools.
673	They held that baby
673	in front of their face,
675.111	cajoling it, reprimanding it,
675.111	educating it with words.
678.944	And, indeed, they're becoming
678.944	a very powerful force.
682	Even in places like India and Japan,
687.261	where women are not moving rapidly
687.261	into the regular job market,
690.682	they're moving into journalism.
692.539	And I think that the television
692.539	is like the global campfire.
697	We sit around it and it shapes our minds.
701	Almost always, when I'm on TV,
701	the producer who calls me,
705.108	who negotiates what we're going to say,
707.275	is a woman.
708.354	In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said,
711.036	"""To have a great writer"
711.036	"is to have another government."""
714.682	Today 54 percent of people
714.682	who are writers in America are women.
720.158	It's one of many, many
720.158	characteristics that women have
722.855	that they will bring into the job market.
725.159	They've got incredible people skills,
725.159	negotiating skills.
729.31	They're highly imaginative.
731	We now know the brain circuitry
731	of imagination, of long-term planning.
735.603	They tend to be web thinkers.
737.747	Because the female parts
737.747	of the brain are better connected,
740.556	they tend to collect more
740.556	pieces of data when they think,
743.754	put them into more complex patterns,
743.754	see more options and outcomes.
748.481	They tend to be contextual,
748.481	holistic thinkers,
752.211	what I call web thinkers.
753.775	Men tend to -- and these are averages --
755.804	tend to get rid of what they regard
755.804	as extraneous,
758.487	focus on what they do,
759.896	and move in a more
759.896	step-by-step thinking pattern.
766.171	They're both perfectly good
766.171	ways of thinking.
768.297	We need both of them to get ahead.
770.553	In fact, there's many more
770.553	male geniuses in the world.
774	And there's also many more
774	male idiots in the world.
776.745	(Laughter)
778.495	When the male brain works well,
778.495	it works extremely well.
781.701	And what I really think
781.701	that we're doing is,
785.059	we're moving towards
785.059	a collaborative society,
787.369	a society in which the talents
787.369	of both men and women
790.195	are becoming understood
790.195	and valued and employed.
794	But in fact, women moving
794	into the job market
796.787	is having a huge impact
796.787	on sex and romance and family life.
802.608	Foremost, women are starting
802.608	to express their sexuality.
807.716	I'm always astonished
807.716	when people come to me and say,
810.366	"""Why is it that men are so adulterous?"""
812.708	"""Why do you think"
812.708	"more men are adulterous than women?"""
815.445	"""Well, men are more adulterous!"""
817.04	"And I say, ""Who do you think"
817.04	"these men are sleeping with?"""
820.002	(Laughter)
821.43	And -- basic math!
823.182	Anyway.
824.38	In the Western world,
828	women start sooner at sex,
828	have more partners,
831	express less remorse
831	for the partners that they do,
833.909	marry later, have fewer children,
836.615	leave bad marriages
836.615	in order to get good ones.
839.544	We are seeing the rise
839.544	of female sexual expression.
843.547	And, indeed, once again we're moving
843.547	forward to the kind of sexual expression
848.292	that we probably saw on the grasslands
848.292	of Africa a million years ago,
852	because this is the kind
852	of sexual expression that we see
855	in hunting and gathering societies today.
857.865	We're also returning
857.865	to an ancient form of marriage equality.
862.42	They're now saying that the 21st century
867	is going to be the century of what
867	"they call the ""symmetrical marriage,"""
871	"or the ""pure marriage,"""
871	"or the ""companionate marriage."""
876.408	This is a marriage between equals,
880	moving forward to a pattern
882.467	that is highly compatible
882.467	with the ancient human spirit.
886.775	We're also seeing a rise of romantic love.
	and 86 percent of American men
894.036	would not marry somebody
894.036	who had every single quality
898.663	they were looking for in a partner,
900.503	if they were not in love with that person.
903.29	People around the world,
903.29	in a study of 37 societies,
906.833	want to be in love
906.833	with the person that they marry.
910.946	Indeed, arranged marriages are
910.946	on their way off this braid of human life.
920.618	I even think that marriages
920.618	might even become more stable
923.436	because of the second great world trend.
927.214	The first one being women
927.214	moving into the job market,
930	the second one being
930	the aging world population.
932.874	They're now saying that in America,
935.325	that middle age should be regarded
935.325	as up to age 85.
939.642	Because in that highest
939.642	age category of 76 to 85,
944.545	as much as 40 percent of people
944.545	have nothing really wrong with them.
948	So we're seeing there's a real
948	extension of middle age.
951.714	For one of my books,
951.714	I looked at divorce data in 58 societies.
957	And as it turns out, the older you get,
957	the less likely you are to divorce.
961.596	So the divorce rate right now
961.596	is stable in America,
965.221	and it's actually beginning to decline.
967.579	It may decline some more.
972.133	I would even say that with Viagra,
976.156	estrogen replacement, hip replacements
979.995	and the incredibly interesting women
982	-- women have never been
982	as interesting as they are now.
985.129	Not at any time on this planet
985.129	have women been so educated,
988.611	so interesting, so capable.
990.962	And so I honestly think that if there
990.962	really was ever a time in human evolution
996.365	when we have the opportunity to make
996.365	good marriages, that time is now.
1001.516	However, there's always kinds
1001.516	of complications in this.
1004.741	These three brain systems --
1004.741	lust, romantic love and attachment --
1009.482	don't always go together.
1010.86	They can go together, by the way.
1012.583	That's why casual sex isn't so casual.
1014.559	With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine.
1016.852	Dopamine's associated with romantic love,
1018.972	and you can just
1018.972	fall in love with somebody
1021.019	who you're just having casual sex with.
1022.906	With orgasm, then you get a real rush
1022.906	of oxytocin and vasopressin --
1026.366	those are associated with attachment.
1028.421	This is why you can feel such a sense
1028.421	of cosmic union with somebody
1032.404	after you've made love to them.
1034.277	But these three brain systems:
1034.277	lust, romantic love and attachment,
1039	aren't always connected to each other.
1042	You can feel deep attachment
1042	to a long-term partner
1045.275	while you feel intense
1045.275	romantic love for somebody else,
1049.391	while you feel the sex drive for people
1049.391	unrelated to these other partners.
1055.312	In short, we're capable of loving
1055.312	more than one person at a time.
1060.714	In fact, you can lie in bed at night
1062.73	and swing from deep feelings
1062.73	of attachment for one person
1066	to deep feelings
1066	of romantic love for somebody else.
1069.456	It's as if there's a committee meeting
1069.456	going on in your head
1072.361	as you are trying to decide what to do.
1075.512	So I don't think, honestly,
1077.171	we're an animal
1077.171	that was built to be happy;
1079.21	we are an animal
1079.21	that was built to reproduce.
1081.502	I think the happiness we find, we make.
1084.461	And I think, however,
1087.967	we can make good relationships
1087.967	with each other.
1091	So I want to conclude with two things.
1093.129	I want to conclude with a worry,
1095.2	and with a wonderful story.
1099.287	The worry is about antidepressants.
1103.631	Over 100 million prescriptions
1103.631	of antidepressants
1108.787	are written every year
1108.787	in the United States.
1112.1	And these drugs are going generic.
1114.689	They are seeping around the world.
1117.743	I know one girl who's been
1117.743	on these antidepressants,
1123	SSRIs, serotonin-enhancing
1123	antidepressants -- since she was 13.
1127	She's 23. She's been on them
1127	ever since she was 13.
1130	I've got nothing against people
1130	who take them short term,
1133.54	when they're going
1133.54	through something horrible.
1135.787	They want to commit suicide
1135.787	or kill somebody else.
1138.166	I would recommend it.
1139.258	But more and more people
1139.258	in the United States
1141.741	are taking them long term.
1144.149	And indeed, what these drugs do
1144.149	is raise levels of serotonin.
1149.974	And by raising levels of serotonin,
1149.974	you suppress the dopamine circuit.
1154.819	Everybody knows that.
1156.944	Dopamine is associated with romantic love.
1161.627	Not only do they suppress
1161.627	the dopamine circuit,
1164.801	but they kill the sex drive.
1167.316	And when you kill the sex drive,
1167.316	you kill orgasm.
1171.164	And when you kill orgasm,
1172.379	you kill that flood of drugs
1172.379	associated with attachment.
1176.712	The things are connected in the brain.
1179	And when you tamper with one brain system,
1181.68	you're going to tamper with another.
1184	I'm just simply saying that a world
1184	without love is a deadly place.
1189.738	So now --
1190.764	(Applause)
1195	Thank you.
1196.727	I want to end with a story.
1198.839	And then, just a comment.
1201.741	I've been studying romantic love
1201.741	and sex and attachment for 30 years.
1208.774	I'm an identical twin;
1208.774	I am interested in why we're all alike.
1212.925	Why you and I are alike,
1212.925	why the Iraqis and the Japanese
1216	and the Australian Aborigines
1216	and the people of the Amazon River
1219.024	are all alike.
1220.777	And about a year ago,
1223.11	an Internet dating service,
1223.11	Match.com, came to me
1226.119	and asked me if I would design
1226.119	a new dating site for them.
1229.795	"I said, ""I don't know anything"
1229.795	about personality. You know?
1232.621	I don't know. Do you think
1232.621	"you've got the right person?"""
1235.365	"They said, ""Yes."""
1236.429	It got me thinking
1236.429	about why it is that you fall in love
1239.476	with one person rather than another.
1241.232	That's my current project;
1241.232	it will be my next book.
1245.262	There's all kinds of reasons
1246.825	that you fall in love
1246.825	with one person rather than another.
1249.602	Timing is important.
1249.602	Proximity is important.
1252.912	Mystery is important.
1254.316	You fall in love with somebody
1254.316	who's somewhat mysterious,
1257.069	in part because mystery
1257.069	elevates dopamine in the brain,
1259.771	probably pushes you
1259.771	over that threshold to fall in love.
1262.561	You fall in love with somebody
1264.014	who fits within
1264.014	"what I call your ""love map,"""
1266.133	an unconscious list of traits
1268.304	that you build in childhood
1268.304	as you grow up.
1270.642	And I also think
1270.642	that you gravitate to certain people,
1273.708	actually, with somewhat
1273.708	complementary brain systems.
1277	And that's what I'm now
1277	contributing to this.
1279.311	But I want to tell you
1279.311	a story, to illustrate.
1283	I've been carrying on here
1283	about the biology of love.
1286.709	I wanted to show you a little bit
1286.709	about the culture of it, too,
1290.42	the magic of it.
1293	It's a story that was told to me
1296.373	by somebody who had
1296.373	heard it just from one --
1298.858	probably a true story.
1301.508	It was a graduate student --
1301.508	I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues --
1305	Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook.
1307	That's where we put our people
1307	in the MRI machine.
1310	And this graduate student was madly
1310	in love with another graduate student,
1314.587	and she was not in love with him.
1318.206	And they were
1318.206	all at a conference in Beijing.
1321.485	And he knew from our work
1324.543	that if you go and do something
1324.543	very novel with somebody,
1328.975	you can drive up
1328.975	the dopamine in the brain,
1331	and perhaps trigger
1331	this brain system for romantic love.
1334.717	(Laughter)
1336.898	So he decided he'd put science to work.
1341.624	And he invited this girl to go off
1341.624	on a rickshaw ride with him.
1345.809	And sure enough -- I've never been in one,
1347.902	but apparently they go
1347.902	all around the buses and the trucks
1350.664	and it's crazy and it's noisy
1350.664	and it's exciting.
1353.506	He figured that this
1353.506	would drive up the dopamine,
1355.816	and she'd fall in love with him.
1357.372	So off they go and she's squealing
1357.372	and squeezing him
1362.37	and laughing and having a wonderful time.
1364.911	An hour later they get down
1364.911	off of the rickshaw,
1368.474	and she throws her hands up and she says,
1372.078	"""Wasn't that wonderful?"""
1374.414	"And, ""Wasn't that rickshaw"
1374.414	"driver handsome!"""
1377.852	(Laughter)
1380.945	(Applause)
1387	There's magic to love!
1388.186	(Applause)
1389.821	But I will end by saying
1389.821	that millions of years ago,
1393.465	we evolved three basic drives:
1395.821	the sex drive, romantic love
1398.364	and attachment to a long-term partner.
1400.728	These circuits are deeply
1400.728	embedded in the human brain.
1404.203	They're going to survive
1404.203	as long as our species survives
1408.63	on what Shakespeare called
1408.63	"""this mortal coil."""
1411.362	Thank you.
1412.392	Chris Anderson: Helen Fisher!
1413.841	(Applause)
