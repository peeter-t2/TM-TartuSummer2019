13.16	I design engineering projects
14.92	for middle school
14.92	and high school students,
17.28	often using materials
17.28	that are pretty unexpected.
21	My inspiration comes
21	from problems in my daily life.
24.88	For example,
26.12	one time I needed a costume
26.12	to go to a comic convention,
30.16	but I didn't want to spend too much money,
32.24	so I made my own ...
34.8	with a light-up crown and skirt.
36.72	(Laughter)
38.64	Another time,
39.88	I was devastated
39.88	because my favorite mobile game,
43.84	Flappy Bird,
45.08	was being taken off the app store.
46.76	(Laughter)
48.84	So I was faced with the dilemma
50.4	to either never update my phone
50.4	or never play Flappy Bird again.
54.32	(Laughter)
57.24	Unhappy with both options,
59.28	I did the only thing
59.28	that made sense to me.
61.84	I made a physical version of Flappy Bird
64.04	that could never be
64.04	taken off the app store.
66.16	(Laughter)
69.12	(Music)
74.28	(Beeping)
77.08	(Music)
78.64	(Laughter)
81	So a few of my friends
81	were also pretty addicted to the game,
84.28	and I invited them to play as well.
86.96	(Video) Friend: Ah!
88.2	(Laughter)
91	(Video) Friend: What the heck?
92.64	(Laughter)
93.68	And they told me that it was
93.68	just as infuriating as the original game.
97.68	(Laughter)
99.04	So I uploaded a demo
99.04	of this project online,
102.44	and to my surprise it went viral.
104.96	It had over two million views
104.96	in just a few days.
108.08	(Laughter)
109.52	And what's more interesting
109.52	are people's comments.
112.76	A lot of people
112.76	wanted to make it their own,
115.2	or asked me how it was made.
117.08	So this kind of confirmed my idea
117.08	that through a creative project,
121.4	we can teach people about engineering.
124.44	With the money made from the viral video,
126.6	we were able to let students
126.6	in our classroom
128.88	all make their own game in a box.
131.56	Although it was pretty challenging,
133.44	they learned a lot of new concepts
133.44	in engineering and programming.
137.16	And they were all eager to learn
137.16	so they could finish the game as well.
140.52	(Laughter)
142.44	So before Flappy Bird Box,
145.08	I had the idea of using creative
145.08	engineering projects to teach students.
150.64	When I was teaching at a middle school,
152.92	we asked our students to build a robot
152.92	from a standard technology kit.
157.76	And I noticed that
157.76	a lot of them seemed bored.
160.68	Then a few of them
160.68	started taking pieces of paper
163.48	and decorating their robots.
165.12	And then more of them got into it,
167.08	and they became
167.08	more interested in the project.
169.72	So I started looking
169.72	for more creative ways
172.64	to introduce technology to students.
175.56	What I found was that most technology kits
175.56	available in school
179.72	look a little intimidating.
181.6	They're all made of plastic parts
181.6	that you can't customize.
185.56	On top of that,
185.56	they're all very expensive,
188.2	costing hundreds of dollars per kit.
190.68	So that's certainly not very affordable
190.68	for most classroom budgets.
195.32	Since I didn't find anything,
196.8	I decided to make something on my own.
199.04	I started with paper and fabric.
202	After all, we all played
202	with those since we were kids,
205.2	and they are also pretty cheap
206.76	and can be found
206.76	anywhere around the house.
210.2	And I prototyped a project
211.92	where students
211.92	can create a light-up creature
214.52	using fabric and googly eyes.
217.04	They were all helping
217.04	each other in classrooms,
219.28	and were laughing
219.28	and discussing the project.
221.72	And most importantly,
222.96	they were able to insert
222.96	their own creativity into the project.
226.68	So because of the success of this project,
228.76	I continued to create
228.76	more engineering projects
231.48	to challenge my students.
233.36	And I also started to take
233.36	these workshops outside of school
237.28	and into the community.
238.84	And something really interesting happened.
241.2	I noticed a lot of people
241.2	from very diverse backgrounds
244.24	started coming to our workshops.
246.64	And specifically,
248.04	there were a lot more women
248.04	and minorities than I expected,
252.92	and that you wouldn't usually see
252.92	at a traditional engineering workshop.
257.28	Now take a look at this employee report
257.28	at a major technology company in 2016.
263.2	Women make up only 19 percent
263.2	of the technology workforce.
267.28	And underrepresented minorities
267.28	make up only four percent.
271.44	This statistic might look familiar
273.519	if you walked into
273.519	a high school robotics club,
277.08	or a college engineering class.
279.72	Now, there's a wide variety of problems
284.04	that contribute to the lack of diversity
284.04	in the technology force.
288.44	Perhaps one solution could be
290.52	to introduce technology to students
290.52	through creative projects.
295.88	I'm not saying that this
295.88	could solve everything,
299.04	but it could introduce technology
302.24	to people who originally
302.24	wouldn't be interested in it
304.92	because of how it has been
304.92	portrayed and taught in school.
308.76	So how do we start to change
308.76	the perception of technology?
313.92	Most students think
313.92	that it's boring or unwelcoming,
318.56	so I have always designed projects
318.56	following three principles.
322.36	First is having a low floor,
324.88	and that means this project
324.88	is easy to get started.
329.08	So take a look at this tutorial.
331.88	The first project
331.88	we asked students to learn
334	is to make a circuit on paper.
336.12	As you can see, it doesn't
336.12	take very long to learn,
338.64	and it's pretty easy even for beginners.
341.8	And having a low floor also means
341.8	that we're removing the financial barrier
346.44	that prevents people
346.44	from completing a project.
349.48	So with paper, copper tape,
349.48	lightbulb and a battery,
353.36	people can complete this project
353.36	for under a dollar.
357.28	So second principle
357.28	is having a high ceiling.
360.76	This means that there's
360.76	a lot of room to grow,
363.84	and students are
363.84	constantly being challenged.
367.4	At first it might just be
367.4	a light-up creature,
370	but then you can add sensors
370	and microcontrollers,
372.84	and start to program the creature
372.84	to interact with its environment.
376.6	(Laughter)
378	And finally,
379.36	the third principle is customization.
381.84	This means that we can make
381.84	this project relevant to anyone.
386.88	That's the beauty
386.88	of using everyday materials;
389.4	it's very easy to customize
389.4	using paper and fabric.
393.16	So even if you don't like Flappy Bird,
396.36	you can still make your own game.
399.44	(Video) Student: So our game
399.44	is about Justin Bieber,
401.92	because he's been speeding,
404.64	and the object is to prevent him
404.64	from getting caught by the LAPD --
409.36	(Laughter)
412	(Video) Student:
412	Yeah, but he's changing so --
414.2	we're a part of his posse.
416.36	(Laughter)
418.48	Thank you.
419.72	(Applause)
