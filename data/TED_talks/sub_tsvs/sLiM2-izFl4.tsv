16.124	Having spent 18 years as a child of the state
20.369	in children's homes and foster care,
22.675	you could say that I'm an expert on the subject,
25.723	and in being an expert, I want to let you know that
29.281	being an expert does in no way make you right
34.888	in light of the truth.
37.888	If you're in care, legally the government is your
42.076	parent, loco parentis.
45.803	Margaret Thatcher was my mother. (Laughter)
49.752	Let's not talk about breastfeeding. (Laughter)
53.401	Harry Potter was a foster child.
56.539	"Pip from ""Great Expectations"" was adopted;"
61.579	Superman was a foster child;
64.661	Cinderella was a foster child;
68.189	Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo,
71.797	was fostered and institutionalized;
74.719	Batman was orphaned;
79.094	"Lyra Belacqua from Philip Pullman's ""Northern Lights"""
82.792	was fostered;
84.481	Jane Eyre, adopted;
87.216	"Roald Dahl's James from ""James and the Giant Peach;"""
91.799	Matilda; Moses -- Moses! (Laughter)
97.311	Moses! (Laughter) --
99.758	"the boys in Michael Morpurgo's ""Friend or Foe;"""
104.254	"Alem in Benjamin Zephaniah's ""Refugee Boy;"""
108.07	Luke Skywalker --
110.654	Luke Skywalker! (Laughter) --
113.525	Oliver Twist;
115.812	"Cassia in ""The Concubine of Shanghai"" by Hong Ying;"
120.023	"Celie in Alice Walker's ""The Color Purple."""
123.38	All of these great fictional characters, all of them
127.992	who were hurt by their condition,
131.989	all of them who spawned thousands of other books
136.637	and other films, all of them
139.092	were fostered, adopted or orphaned.
143.245	It seems that writers know that the child
148.809	outside of family reflects on what family truly is
155.958	more than what it promotes itself to be.
159.548	That is, they also use extraordinary skills
164.515	to deal with extraordinary situations on a daily basis.
169.344	How have we not made the connection?
172.866	And why have we not made the connection, between
176.904	— How has that happened? —
179.104	between these incredible characters of popular culture
182.672	and religions, and the fostered, adopted or orphaned child
187.76	in our midst? It's not our pity that they need.
192.392	It's our respect.
194.993	I know famous musicians,
197.61	I know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists
202.682	and top lawyers and television executives
206.183	and magazine editors and national journalists
208.633	and dustbinmen and hairdressers, all who were
211.474	looked after children, fostered, adopted or orphaned,
215.01	and many of them grow into their adult lives
217.682	in fear of speaking of their background, as if it may
221.953	somehow weaken their standing in the foreground,
226.26	as if it were somehow Kryptonite, as if it were a time bomb
230.302	strapped on the inside. Children in care,
234.349	who've had a life in care, deserve the right
237.483	to own and live the memory of their own childhood.
243.333	It is that simple.
245.612	My own mother — and I should say this here —
249.618	she same to this country in the late '60s,
253.472	and she was, you know, she found herself pregnant,
257.237	as women did in the late '60s. You know what I mean?
259.332	They found themselves pregnant.
261.281	And she sort of, she had no idea of the context
265.955	in which she'd landed.
270.075	In the 1960s -- I should give you some context -- in the 1960s,
273.923	if you were pregnant and you were single,
277.274	you were seen as a threat to the community.
280.175	You were separated from your family by the state.
286.034	You were separated from your family and placed into
288.736	mother and baby homes.
290.858	You were appointed a social worker.
293.999	The adoptive parents were lined up.
296.389	It was the primary purpose of the social worker, the aim,
300.474	to get the woman at her most vulnerable time
303.815	in her entire life, to sign the adoption papers.
309.168	So the adoption papers were signed.
311.053	The mother and baby's homes were often run by nuns.
314.623	The adoption papers were signed,
317.799	the child was given to the adoptive parents, and the mother
321.495	shipped back to her community
323.919	to say that she'd been on a little break.
326.91	A little break.
329.596	A little break.
331.274	The first secret of shame for a woman
334.839	"for being a woman, ""a little break."""
339.918	The adoption process took, like, a matter of months,
343.009	so it was a closed shop, you know, sealed deal,
346.889	an industrious, utilitarian solution:
353.394	the government, the farmer,
356.752	the adopting parents, the consumer,
360.599	the mother, the earth, and the child, the crop.
365.401	It's kind of easy to patronize the past,
370.055	to forego our responsibilities in the present.
374.959	What happened then is a direct reflection
378.811	of what is happening now. Everybody believed themselves
384.055	to be doing the right thing by God and by the state
388.592	for the big society, fast-tracking adoption.
395.479	So anyway, she comes here, 1967, she's pregnant,
400.672	and she comes from Ethiopia that was celebrating
405.75	its own jubilee at the time
408.448	under the Emperor Haile Selassie,
411.218	and she lands months before the Enoch Powell speech,
416.344	"the ""Rivers of Blood"" speech."
418.464	"She lands months before the Beatles release ""The White Album,"""
423.086	months before Martin Luther King was killed.
425.77	It was a summer of love if you were white.
428.221	If you were black, it was a summer of hate.
431.913	So she goes from Oxford, she's sent to the north of England
437.563	to a mother and baby home, and appointed a social worker.
441.923	It's her plan. You know, I have to say this in the Houses --
446.163	It's her plan to have me fostered for a short period of time
450.434	while she studies. But the social worker,
454.009	he had a different agenda.
457.003	He found the foster parents, and he said to them,
461.21	"""Treat this as an adoption. He's yours forever."
465.042	"His name is Norman."" (Laughter)"
468.489	Norman! (Laughter)
470.826	Norman!
473.538	So they took me. I was a message, they said.
479.764	I was a sign from God, they said.
482.223	I was Norman Mark Greenwood.
485.967	Now, for the next 11 years, all I know is that this woman,
489.386	this birth woman, should have her eyes scratched out
491.974	for not signing the adoption papers. She was an evil woman
494.976	too selfish to sign, so I spent those 11 years
498.053	kneeling and praying.
500.809	I tried praying. I swear I tried praying.
503.93	"""God, can I have a bike for Christmas?"""
507.738	"But I would always answer myself, ""Yes, of course you can."""
512.086	(Laughter)
513.7	And then I was supposed to determine whether that
516.437	was the voice of God or it was the voice of the Devil.
519.969	And it turns out I've got the Devil inside of me.
527.328	Who knew? (Laughter)
529.736	So anyway, two years sort of passed,
532.632	and they had a child of their own,
534.41	and then another two years passed, and they had another child of their own,
536.874	and then another time passed
539.165	and they had another child that they called an accident,
541.742	which I thought was an unusual name. (Laughter)
545.15	And I was on the cusp of, sort of, adolescence,
548.879	so I was starting to take biscuits from the tin without asking.
553.284	I was starting to stay out a little bit late, etc., etc.
557.061	Now, in their religiosity, in their naivete,
560.464	my mom and dad, which I believed them to be forever,
562.901	as they said they were, my mom and dad
566.169	conceived that I had the Devil inside of me.
572.978	And what -- I should say this here, because this is how
575.036	they engineered my leaving.
576.995	They sat me at a table, my foster mom, and she said to me,
580.384	"""You don't love us, do you?"" At 11 years old."
582.452	They've had three other children. I'm the fourth. The third was an accident.
585.961	"And I said, ""Yeah, of course I do."" Because you do."
590.006	My foster mother asked me to go away to think about love
592.157	and what it is and to read the Scriptures and to come back tomorrow
595.001	and give my most honest and truthful answer.
597.944	So this was an opportunity. If they were asking me
600.784	whether I loved them or not, then I mustn't love them,
603.12	which led me to the miracle of thought that I thought they wanted me to get to.
605.985	"""I will ask God for forgiveness and His light will shine"
608.656	"through me to them. How fantastic."" This was an opportunity."
612.424	The theology was perfect, the timing unquestionable,
615.209	and the answer as honest as a sinner could get.
618.112	"""I mustn't love you,"" I said to them. ""But I will ask God for forgiveness."""
622.8	"""Because you don't love us, Norman,"
625.352	"clearly you've chosen your path."""
627.696	Twenty-four hours later, my social worker,
630.494	this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months,
633.543	he's waiting for me in the car as I say goodbye to my parents.
636.755	I didn't say goodbye to anybody, not my mother, my father,
639.331	my sisters, my brothers, my aunts, my uncles,
641.159	my cousins, my grandparents, nobody.
644.788	On the way to the children's home, I started to ask myself,
648.335	"""What's happened to me?"""
651.31	It's not that I'd had the rug pulled from beneath me
654.463	as much as the entire floor had been taken away.
659.278	When I got to the —
663.078	For the next four, five years,
667.461	I was held in four different children's homes.
672.314	On the third children's home, at 15,
675.591	I started to rebel, and what I did was,
678.758	I got three tins of paint, Airfix paint that you use for models,
683.087	and I was -- it was a big children's home, big Victorian children's home --
686.918	and I was in a little turret at the top of it,
688.758	and I poured them, red, yellow and green,
692.061	the colors of Africa, down the tiles.
697.102	You couldn't see it from the street, because the home
699.606	was surrounded by beech trees.
702.058	For doing this, I was incarcerated for a year
707.014	in an assessment center which was actually
709.999	a remand center. It was a virtual prison
714.719	for young people.
718.617	By the way, years later, my social worker said
720.67	that I should never have been put in there.
722.129	I wasn't charged for anything. I hadn't done anything wrong.
724.784	But because I had no family to inquire about me,
729.51	they could do anything to me.
734.261	I'm 17 years old, and
737.615	they had a padded cell.
741.256	They would march me down corridors in last-size order.
747.216	They -- I was put in a dormitory
749.481	with a confirmed Nazi sympathizer.
753.401	All of the staff were ex-police -- interesting --
756.723	and ex-probation officers.
758.737	The man who ran it was an ex-army officer.
762.8	Every time I had a visit by a person who I did not know
765.96	who would feed me grapes, once every three months,
769.694	I was strip-searched.
771.905	That home was full of young boys who were on remand
775.158	for things like murder.
780.426	And this was the preparation that I was being given
784.458	after 17 years as a child of the state.
790.509	I have to tell this story.
793.092	I have to tell it, because there was no one
795.362	to put two and two together.
798.315	I slowly became aware that I knew nobody
801.342	that knew me for longer than a year.
804.836	See, that's what family does.
807.685	It gives you reference points.
810.076	I'm not defining a good family from a bad family.
812.564	I'm just saying that you know when your birthday is
814.38	by virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is,
817.036	a mother, a father, a sister, a brother, an aunt, an uncle,
818.983	a cousin, a grandparent. It matters to someone,
820.993	and therefore it matters to you. Understand,
823.28	I was 14 years old, tucked away in myself, into myself,
827.509	and I wasn't touched either, physically touched.
832.291	I'm reporting back. I'm reporting back simply to say that
840.418	when I left the children's home I had two things
843.633	that I wanted to do. One was to find my family,
847.43	and the other was to write poetry.
848.96	In creativity I saw light.
851.509	In the imagination I saw the endless possibility of life,
856.671	the endless truth, the permanent creation of reality,
862.572	the place where anger was an expression
869.035	in the search for love, a place where dysfunction
872.783	is a true reaction to untruth.
877.501	I've just got to say it to you all: I found all of my family
881.048	in my adult life. I spent all of my adult life finding them,
884.411	and I've now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else.
888.426	But I'm reporting back to you to say quite simply
892.166	that you can define how strong a democracy is
897.678	by how its government treats its child.
902.911	I don't mean children. I mean the child of the state.
904.967	Thanks very much. It's been an honor. (Applause)
909.934	(Applause)
