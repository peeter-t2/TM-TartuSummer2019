12.844	I used to have this recurring dream
14.929	where I'd walk into a roomful of people,
18.388	and I'd try not to make
18.388	eye contact with anyone.
22.22	Until someone notices me,
23.959	and I just panic.
26.213	And the person walks up to me,
28.041	"and says, ""Hi, my name is So-and-so."
30.574	"And what is your name?"""
32.313	And I'm just quiet, unable to respond.
37.196	After some awkward silence, he goes,
39.663	"""Have you forgotten your name?"""
41.851	And I'm still quiet.
44.293	And then, slowly, all the other people
44.293	in the room begin to turn toward me
48.963	and ask, almost in unison,
51.83	(Voice-over, several voices)
51.83	"""Have you forgotten your name?"""
56.616	As the chant gets louder,
56.616	I want to respond, but I don't.
62.35	I'm a visual artist.
64.754	Some of my work is humorous,
67.359	and some is a bit funny but in a sad way.
72.16	And one thing that I really enjoy doing
76.891	is making these little animations
79.181	where I get to do the voice-over
79.181	for all kinds of characters.
82.979	I've been a bear.
84.261	(Video) Bear (Safwat Saleem's voice): Hi.
86.354	(Laughter)
88.129	Safwat Saleem: I've been a whale.
89.813	(Video) Whale (SS's voice): Hi.
91.526	(Laughter)
92.813	SS: I've been a greeting card.
94.301	(Video) Greeting card (SS's voice): Hi.
96.378	(Laughter)
97.481	SS: And my personal favorite
97.481	is Frankenstein's monster.
100.512	(Video) Frankenstein's monster
100.512	(SS's voice): (Grunts)
103.233	(Laughter)
104.297	SS: I just had to grunt
104.297	a lot for that one.
106.421	A few years ago,
106.421	I made this educational video
109.128	about the history of video games.
112.048	And for that one, I got to do
112.048	the voice of Space Invader.
115.814	(Video) Space Invader (SS's voice): Hi.
117.894	SS: A dream come true, really,
119.365	(Laughter)
120.391	And when that video was posted online,
122.494	I just sat there on the computer,
122.494	"hitting ""refresh,"""
125.208	excited to see the response.
127.208	The first comment comes in.
128.646	(Video) Comment: Great job.
129.964	SS: Yes!
131.709	"I hit ""refresh."""
132.988	(Video) Comment: Excellent video.
132.988	I look forward to the next one.
136.115	SS: This was just the first
136.115	of a two-part video.
138.635	I was going to work
138.635	on the second one next.
140.7	"I hit ""refresh."""
141.89	(Video) Comment: Where is part TWO?
141.89	WHEREEEEE? I need it NOWWWWW!: P
145.75	(Laughter)
147.292	SS: People other than my mom
147.292	were saying nice things about me,
150.259	on the Internet!
151.449	It felt like I had finally arrived.
153.806	"I hit ""refresh."""
155.132	(Video) Comment: His voice
155.132	is annoying. No offense.
157.855	SS: OK, no offense taken. Refresh.
160.549	(Video) Comment: Could you remake this
160.549	without peanut butter in your mouth?
164.137	SS: OK, at least the feedback
164.137	"is somewhat constructive. Hit ""refresh."""
168.628	(Video) Comment: Please don't use
168.628	this narrator again
171.198	u can barely understand him.
172.584	SS: Refresh.
173.759	(Video) Comment: Couldn't follow
173.759	because of the Indian accent.
176.763	SS: OK, OK, OK, two things.
178.271	Number one, I don't have an Indian accent,
180.367	I have a Pakistani accent, OK?
182.318	And number two, I clearly
182.318	have a Pakistani accent.
185.482	(Laughter)
188.233	But comments like that kept coming in,
190.282	so I figured I should just ignore them
193.051	and start working
193.051	on the second part of the video.
196.104	I recorded my audio,
197.658	but every time I sat down to edit,
200.681	I just could not do it.
203.688	Every single time, it would take me
203.688	back to my childhood,
206.7	when I had a much harder time speaking.
209.934	I've stuttered for as long
209.934	as I can remember.
214.285	I was the kid in class
215.586	who would never raise his hand
215.586	when he had a question --
218.247	or knew the answer.
219.445	Every time the phone rang,
220.784	I would run to the bathroom
220.784	so I would not have to answer it.
224.907	If it was for me, my parents
224.907	would say I'm not around.
228.14	I spent a lot of time in the bathroom.
231.721	And I hated introducing myself,
234.216	especially in groups.
235.849	I'd always stutter on my name,
235.849	and there was usually someone who'd go,
239.249	"""Have you forgotten your name?"""
240.8	And then everybody would laugh.
242.856	That joke never got old.
246.727	(Laughter)
249.635	I spent my childhood
249.635	feeling that if I spoke,
253.466	it would become obvious
253.466	that there was something wrong with me,
258.645	that I was not normal.
261.07	So I mostly stayed quiet.
264.142	And so you see, eventually for me to even
264.142	be able to use my voice in my work
267.929	was a huge step for me.
269.991	Every time I record audio,
271.611	I fumble my way through saying
271.611	each sentence many, many times,
275.13	and then I go back in
276.788	and pick the ones
276.788	where I think I suck the least.
282.997	(Voice-over) SS: Audio editing
282.997	is like Photoshop for your voice.
286.1	I can slow it down, speed it up,
286.1	make it deeper, add an echo.
289.935	And if I stutter along the way,
289.935	and if I stutter along the way,
293.706	I just go back in and fix it.
295.349	It's magic.
296.768	SS: Using my highly edited
296.768	voice in my work
299.697	was a way for me
299.697	to finally sound normal to myself.
304.302	But after the comments on the video,
306.924	it no longer made me feel normal.
309.897	And so I stopped
309.897	using my voice in my work.
313.984	Since then, I've thought a lot
313.984	about what it means to be normal.
319.218	And I've come to understand
321.26	"that ""normal"" has a lot to do"
321.26	with expectations.
325.307	Let me give you an example.
326.86	I came across this story
328.214	about the Ancient Greek writer, Homer.
330.504	Now, Homer mentions
330.504	very few colors in his writing.
334.65	And even when he does,
336.279	he seems to get them quite a bit wrong.
338.936	For example, the sea
338.936	is described as wine red,
342.252	people's faces are sometimes green
342.252	and sheep are purple.
346.838	But it's not just Homer.
348.237	If you look at all
348.237	of the ancient literature --
350.57	Ancient Chinese, Icelandic, Greek, Indian
352.794	and even the original Hebrew Bible --
355.495	they all mention very few colors.
358.745	And the most popular theory
358.745	for why that might be the case
362.149	is that cultures begin
362.149	to recognize a color
364.577	only once they have the ability
364.577	to make that color.
367.686	So basically, if you can make a color,
369.56	only then can you see it.
371.727	A color like red, which was fairly easy
371.727	for many cultures to make --
375.41	they began to see that color
375.41	fairly early on.
378.265	But a color like blue,
378.265	which was much harder to make --
381.032	many cultures didn't begin to learn
381.032	how to make that color
383.809	until much later.
384.999	They didn't begin to see it
384.999	until much later as well.
387.539	So until then, even though
387.539	a color might be all around them,
391.213	they simply did not have
391.213	the ability to see it.
393.682	It was invisIble.
394.864	It was not a part of their normal.
398.593	And that story has helped
398.593	put my own experience into context.
402.376	So when I first read
402.376	the comments on the video,
404.87	my initial reaction was to take it
404.87	all very personally.
408.543	But the people commenting did not know
410.465	how self-conscious I am about my voice.
414.258	They were mostly reacting to my accent,
416.929	that it is not normal
416.929	for a narrator to have an accent.
421.089	But what is normal, anyway?
423.473	We know that reviewers will find
423.473	more spelling errors in your writing
426.859	if they think you're black.
429.144	We know that professors are less likely
429.144	to help female or minority students.
434.349	And we know that resumes
434.349	with white-sounding names
437.02	get more callbacks than resumes
437.02	with black-sounding names.
441.043	Why is that?
443.011	Because of our expectations
443.011	of what is normal.
446.135	We think it is normal
447.738	when a black student has spelling errors.
450.264	We think it is normal
452.003	when a female or minority student
452.003	does not succeed.
455.962	And we think it is normal
457.625	that a white employee
457.625	is a better hire than a black employee.
461.399	But studies also show
461.399	that discrimination of this kind,
464.017	in most cases, is simply favoritism,
466.086	and it results more from wanting
466.086	to help people that you can relate to
470.493	than the desire to harm people
470.493	that you can't relate to.
474.944	And not relating to people
474.944	starts at a very early age.
478.175	Let me give you an example.
479.949	One library that keeps track of characters
483.522	in the children's book
483.522	collection every year,
486.839	found that in 2014,
486.839	only about 11 percent of the books
492.144	had a character of color.
494.368	And just the year before,
494.368	that number was about eight percent,
498.069	even though half of American children
498.069	today come from a minority background.
501.901	Half.
503.353	So there are two big issues here.
505.001	Number one, children are told
505.001	that they can be anything,
507.682	they can do anything,
508.857	and yet, most stories
508.857	that children of color consume
511.354	are about people who are not like them.
513.256	Number two is that majority groups
513.256	don't get to realize
516.039	the great extent to which
516.039	they are similar to minorities --
519.096	our everyday experiences, our hopes,
522.167	our dreams, our fears
524.063	and our mutual love for hummus.
525.86	It's delicious!
527.193	(Laughter)
529.911	Just like the color blue
529.911	for Ancient Greeks,
532.618	minorities are not a part
532.618	of what we consider normal,
537.44	because normal is simply a construction
537.44	of what we've been exposed to,
542.425	and how visible it is around us.
545.59	And this is where things
545.59	get a bit difficult.
548.714	I can accept the preexisting notion
548.714	of normal -- that normal is good,
553.018	and anything outside of that very
553.018	narrow definition of normal is bad.
557.758	Or I can challenge
557.758	that preexisting notion of normal
562.462	with my work
564.034	and with my voice
566.338	and with my accent
568.632	and by standing here onstage,
570.172	even though I'm scared shitless
570.172	and would rather be in the bathroom.
573.519	(Laughter)
574.86	(Applause)
585.301	(Video) Sheep (SS's voice):
585.301	I'm now slowly starting to use my voice
588.496	in my work again.
589.674	And it feels good.
590.849	It does not mean I won't have a breakdown
592.841	the next time a couple dozen
592.841	people say that I talk
595.332	(Mumbling) like I have peanut
595.332	butter in my mouth.
597.664	(Laughter)
598.69	SS: It just means I now have
598.69	a much better understanding
601.394	of what's at stake,
603.162	and how giving up is not an option.
608.519	The Ancient Greeks didn't just wake up
608.519	one day and realize
611.429	that the sky was blue.
613.197	It took centuries, even, for humans
613.197	to realize what we had been ignoring
616.659	for so long.
618.893	And so we must continuously challenge
618.893	our notion of normal,
622.738	because doing so is going
622.738	to allow us as a society
627.094	to finally see the sky for what it is.
632.272	(Video) Characters: Thank you. Thank you.
632.272	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
638.06	Frankenstein's monster: (Grunts)
639.675	(Laughter)
640.71	SS: Thank you.
641.885	(Applause)
