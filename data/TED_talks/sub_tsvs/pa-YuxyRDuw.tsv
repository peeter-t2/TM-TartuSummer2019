13.37	This is Charley Williams.
15.111	He was 94 when this photograph was taken.
17.387	In the 1930s, Roosevelt put
20.444	thousands and thousands of Americans back to work
22.424	by building bridges and infrastructure and tunnels,
24.95	but he also did something interesting,
26.365	which was to hire a few hundred writers
28.677	to scour America to capture the stories of ordinary Americans.
32.638	Charley Williams, a poor sharecropper,
34.799	wouldn't ordinarily be the subject of a big interview,
37.461	but Charley had actually been a slave
39.889	until he was 22 years old.
42.447	And the stories that were captured of his life
44.761	make up one of the crown jewels
47.54	of histories, of human-lived experiences
50.865	filled with ex-slaves.
53.14	Anna Deavere Smith famously said that
55.24	there's a literature inside of each of us,
57.728	and three generations later, I was part of a project
59.991	called StoryCorps,
61.552	which set out to capture
63.544	the stories of ordinary Americans
65.569	by setting up a soundproof booth in public spaces.
68.466	The idea is very, very simple.
69.696	You go into these booths, you interview your grandmother
72.567	or relative, you leave with a copy of the interview
74.855	and an interview goes into the Library of Congress.
77.642	It's essentially a way to make a national oral histories archive
81	one conversation at a time.
83.272	And the question is, who do you want to remember --
85.746	if you had just 45 minutes with your grandmother?
88.818	What's interesting, in conversations with the founder, Dave Isay,
91.19	we always actually talked about this
92.338	as a little bit of a subversive project,
94.588	because when you think about it,
95.989	it's actually not really about the stories that are being told,
98.505	it's about listening,
99.811	and it's about the questions that you get to ask,
101.845	questions that you may not have permission to
103.923	on any other day.
105.193	I'm going to play you just a couple of quick excerpts from the project.
110.131	[Jesus Melendez talking about poet Pedro Pietri's final moments]
112.109	Jesus Melendez: We took off, and as we were ascending,
114.675	before we had leveled off,
116.318	our level-off point was 45,000 feet,
118.747	so before we had leveled off,
120.649	Pedro began leaving us,
122.934	and the beauty about it
125.147	is that I believe that there's something after life.
128.979	You can see it in Pedro.
132.273	[Danny Perasa to his wife Annie Perasa married 26 years]
135.849	Danny Perasa: See, the thing of it is,
137.579	"I always feel guilty when I say ""I love you"" to you,"
140.282	and I say it so often. I say it to remind you
143.174	that as dumpy as I am, it's coming from me,
146.228	it's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio,
150.5	and it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house.
152.625	(Laughter)
154.938	[Michael Wolmetz with his girlfriend Debora Brakarz]
157.638	Michael Wolmetz: So this is the ring that my father gave to my mother,
160.696	and we can leave it there.
162.228	And he saved up and he purchased this,
164.036	and he proposed to my mother with this,
165.921	and so I thought that I would give it to you
167.862	so that he could be with us for this also.
171.592	So I'm going to share a mic with you right now, Debora.
174.95	Where's the right finger?
176.767	Debora Brakarz: (Crying)
178.54	MW: Debora, will you please marry me?
182.258	DB: Yes. Of course. I love you.
185.697	(Kissing)
188.358	MW: So kids, this is how your mother and I got married,
192.919	in a booth in Grand Central Station with my father's ring.
196.618	My grandfather was a cab driver for 40 years.
198.752	He used to pick people up here every day.
200.855	So it seems right.
202.982	Jake Barton: So I have to say
204.621	I did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry
207.628	because they all make you cry.
209.628	The entire project is predicated on this act of love
212.342	which is listening itself.
213.893	And that motion of building an institution
216.678	out of a moment of conversation and listening
218.519	is actually a lot of what my firm, Local Projects,
220.371	is doing with our engagements in general.
223.37	So we're a media design firm, and we're working
225.1	with a broad array of different institutions
227.249	building media installations for museums and public spaces.
230.482	Our latest engagement is the Cleveland Museum of Art,
233.158	which we've created an engagement called Gallery One for.
236.238	And Gallery One is an interesting project
238.384	because it started with this massive, $350 million expansion
242.576	for the Cleveland Museum of Art,
244.055	and we actually brought in this piece
246.382	specifically to grow new capacity, new audiences,
248.885	at the same time that the museum itself is growing.
251.694	Glenn Lowry, the head of MoMA, put it best when he said,
253.898	"""We want visitors to actually cease being visitors."
256.752	Visitors are transient. We want people who live here,
258.931	"people who have ownership."""
260.604	And so what we're doing is making a broad array
262.389	of different ways for people to actually engage
264.087	with the material inside of these galleries,
266.286	so you can still have a traditional gallery experience,
269.069	but if you're interested, you can actually engage
271.577	with any individual artwork and see the original context
274.378	from where it's from, or manipulate the work itself.
277.12	So, for example, you can click on this individual lion head,
279.835	and this is where it originated from, 1300 B.C.
283.109	Or this individual piece here,
285.219	you can see the actual bedroom. It really changes the way
287.734	you think about this type of a tempera painting.
291.074	This is one of my favorites because you see the studio itself.
293.572	This is Rodin's bust. You get the sense
295.417	of this incredible factory for creativity.
297.885	And it makes you think about literally the hundreds
299.717	or thousands of years of human creativity and how
302.312	each individual artwork stands in for part of that story.
305.367	This is Picasso,
306.658	of course embodying so much of it from the 20th century.
309.636	And so our next interface, which I'll show you,
311.937	actually leverages that idea of this lineage of creativity.
315.12	It's an algorithm that actually allows you to browse
318.738	the actual museum's collection using facial recognition.
321.937	So this person's making different faces,
323.863	and it's actually drawing forth different objects
326.27	from the collection that connect with exactly how she's looking.
329.51	And so you can imagine that, as people are performing
333.555	inside of the museum itself, you get this sense
336.085	of this emotional connection,
337.085	this way in which our face connects with the thousands
339.438	and tens of thousands of years.
341.351	This is an interface that actually allows you to draw
343.546	and then draws forth objects using those same shapes.
347.49	So more and more we're trying to find ways
349.155	for people to actually author things inside of the museums themselves,
352.241	to be creative even as they're looking
354.241	at other people's creativity and understanding them.
356.929	So in this wall, the collections wall,
359.25	you can actually see all 3,000 artworks all at the same time,
362.749	and you can actually author your own
364.625	individual walking tours of the museum, so you can share them,
367.99	and someone can take a tour with the museum director
370.792	or a tour with their little cousin.
373.022	But all the while that we've been working
374.112	on this engagement for Cleveland,
376.25	we've also been working in the background
377.685	on really our largest engagement to date,
379.686	and that's the 9/11 Memorial and Museum.
383.27	So we started in 2006
385.879	as part of a team with Thinc Design
388.423	to create the original master plan for the museum,
390.92	and then we've done all the media design
392.62	both for the museum and the memorial and then the media production.
395.207	So the memorial opened in 2011,
398.077	and the museum's going to open next year in 2014.
400.602	And you can see from these images,
401.886	the site is so raw and almost archaeological.
405.494	And of course the event itself is so recent,
407.468	somewhere between history and current events,
410.22	it was a huge challenge to imagine
411.703	how do you actually live up to a space like this,
414.653	an event like this, to actually tell that story.
416.847	And so what we started with
418.86	was really a new way of thinking about building an institution,
422.491	through a project called Make History,
423.998	which we launched in 2009.
425.833	So it's estimated that a third of the world
428.766	watched 9/11 live,
430.446	and a third of the world
431.769	heard about it within 24 hours,
433.248	making it really by nature of when it happened,
435.616	this unprecedented moment of global awareness.
438.816	And so we launched this to capture the stories
441.107	from all around the world,
442.21	through video, through photos,
443.876	through written history,
445.053	and so people's experiences on that day,
446.777	which was, in fact, this huge risk for the institution
448.843	to make its first move this open platform.
451.312	But that was coupled together with this oral histories booth,
454.27	really the simplest we've ever made,
455.387	where you locate yourself on a map.
456.515	It's in six languages, and you can tell your own story
459.091	about what happened to you on that day.
461.103	And when we started seeing the incredible images
464.46	and stories that came forth
465.908	from all around the world --
467.177	this is obviously part of the landing gear --
469.249	we really started to understand
471.438	that there was this amazing symmetry
473.523	between the event itself,
475.046	between the way that people were telling the stories of the event,
477.345	and how we ourselves needed to tell that story.
480.641	This image in particular really captured
482.795	our attention at the time,
483.976	because it so much sums up that event.
486.464	This is a shot from the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel.
489.071	There's a firefighter that's stuck, actually, in traffic,
492.2	and so the firefighters themselves are running
495.028	a mile and a half to the site itself
496.637	with upwards of 70 pounds of gear on their back.
499.607	And we got this amazing email that said,
502.4	"""While viewing the thousands of photos on the site,"
504.238	I unexpectedly found a photo of my son.
507.211	"It was a shock emotionally, yet a blessing to find this photo,"""
510.171	and he was writing because he said,
511.492	"""I'd like to personally thank the photographer"
513.832	for posting the photo,
514.981	as it meant more than words can describe to me
517.083	to have access to what is probably
518.876	"the last photo ever taken of my son."""
523.319	And it really made us recognize
525.62	what this institution needed to be
528.221	in order to actually tell that story.
530.591	We can't have just a historian or a curator narrating
534.387	objectively in the third person about an event like that,
537.634	when you have the witnesses to history
540.164	who are going to make their way
541.01	through the actual museum itself.
544.155	And so we started imagining the museum,
546.028	along with the creative team at the museum and the curators,
549.4	thinking about how the first voice that you would hear
551.297	inside the museum would actually be of other visitors.
553.906	And so we created this idea of an opening gallery
556.394	called We Remember.
557.831	And I'll just play you part of a mockup of it,
559.656	but you get a sense of what it's like to actually enter
561.603	into that moment in time
562.866	and be transported back in history.
566.119	(Video) Voice 1: I was in Honolulu, Hawaii.
566.119	Voice 2: I was in Cairo, Egypt.
569.93	Voice 3: Sur les Champs-Élysées, à Paris.
569.93	Voice 4: In college, at U.C. Berkeley.
573.368	Voice 5: I was in Times Square.
573.368	Voice 6: São Paolo, Brazil.
576.574	(Multiple voices)
581.19	Voice 7: It was probably about 11 o'clock at night.
583.986	Voice 8: I was driving to work at 5:45 local time in the morning.
587.734	Voice 9: We were actually in a meeting
588.995	when someone barged in and said,
590.722	"""Oh my God, a plane has just crashed into the World Trade Center."""
594.515	Voice 10: Trying to frantically get to a radio.
596.69	Voice 11: When I heard it over the radio --
598.119	Voice 12: Heard it on the radio.
599.495	(Multiple voices)
601.245	Voice 13: I got a call from my father.
601.245	Voice 14: The phone rang, it woke me up.
604.179	My business partner told me to turn on the television.
606.12	Voice 15: So I switched on the television.
608.489	Voice 16: All channels in Italy were displaying the same thing.
610.877	Voice 17: The Twin Towers.
610.877	Voice 18: The Twin Towers.
613.719	JB: And you move from there
614.816	into that open, cavernous space.
616.9	This is the so-called slurry wall.
618.785	It's the original, excavated wall at the base of the World Trade Center
621.959	that withstood the actual pressure from the Hudson River
624.961	for a full year after the event itself.
626.998	And so we thought about carrying that sense of authenticity,
630.199	of presence of that moment
632.574	into the actual exhibition itself.
634.099	And we tell the stories of being inside the towers
636.849	through that same audio collage,
638.383	so you're hearing people literally talking about
640.35	seeing the planes as they make their way into the building,
643.274	or making their way down the stairwells.
645.377	And as you make your way into the exhibition
647.624	where it talks about the recovery,
649.47	we actually project directly onto these moments
651.958	of twisted steel all of the experiences from people
655.155	who literally excavated on top of the pile itself.
658.49	And so you can hear oral histories --
660.494	so people who were actually working the so-called bucket brigades
662.965	as you're seeing literally the thousands of experiences
666.15	from that moment.
667.985	And as you leave that storytelling moment
669.839	understanding about 9/11,
671.702	we then turn the museum back into a moment of listening
674.75	and actually talk to the individual visitors
677.522	and ask them their own experiences about 9/11.
680.153	And we ask them questions that are actually
681.37	not really answerable, the types of questions
683.408	that 9/11 itself draws forth for all of us.
686.904	And so these are questions like,
688.326	"""How can a democracy balance freedom and security?"""
691.483	"""How could 9/11 have happened?"""
695.057	"""And how did the world change after 9/11?"""
697.192	And so these oral histories,
698.723	which we've actually been capturing already for years,
701.606	are then mixed together with interviews
703.745	that we're doing with people like Donald Rumsfeld,
705.971	Bill Clinton, Rudy Giuliani,
707.843	and you mix together these different players
709.963	and these different experiences,
710.994	these different reflection points about 9/11.
713.36	And suddenly the institution, once again,
715.055	turns into a listening experience.
717.396	So I'll play you just a short excerpt
719.217	of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices,
721.171	but you really get a sense
722.968	of the poetry of everyone's reflection on the event.
726.915	(Video) Voice 1: 9/11 was not just a New York experience.
730.258	Voice 2: It's something that we shared, and it's something that united us.
734.268	Voice 3: And I knew when I saw that,
735.822	people who were there that day who immediately
737.877	went to help people known and unknown to them
740.937	was something that would pull us through.
742.955	Voice 4: All the outpouring of affection and emotion
745.774	that came from our country was something really
747.742	that will forever, ever stay with me.
750.56	Voice 5: Still today I pray and think about those
752.306	who lost their lives,
753.995	and those who gave their lives to help others,
756.672	but I'm also reminded of the fabric of this country,
760.091	the love, the compassIon, the strength,
762.411	and I watched a nation come together
764.84	in the middle of a terrible tragedy.
770.013	JB: And so as people make their way out of the museum,
772.72	reflecting on the experience, reflecting on their own thoughts of it,
775.808	they then move into the actual space of the memorial itself,
778.984	because they've gone back up to grade,
781.062	and we actually got involved in the memorial
783.129	after we'd done the museum for a few years.
785.368	The original designer of the memorial, Michael Arad,
788.177	had this image in his mind of all the names appearing
790.707	undifferentiated, almost random,
793.103	really a poetic reflection on top of the nature
796.935	of a terrorism event itself,
798.452	but it was a huge challenge for the families, for the foundation,
801.56	certainly for the first responders,
803.436	and there was a negotiation that went forth
805.566	and a solution was found
807.079	to actually create not an order in terms of chronology,
810.442	or in terms of alphabetical,
811.806	but through what's called meaningful adjacency.
813.952	So these are groupings of the names themselves
816.703	which appear undifferentiated but actually have an order,
819.371	and we, along with Jer Thorp, created an algorithm
822.607	to take massive amounts of data
824.602	to actually start to connect together all these different names themselves.
827.927	So this is an image of the actual algorithm itself
830.959	with the names scrambled for privacy,
833.315	but you can see that these blocks of color
835.695	are actually the four different flights,
837.645	the two different towers, the first responders,
840.422	and you can actually see within that different floors,
842.994	and then the green lines are the interpersonal connections
845.785	that were requested by the families themselves.
848.959	And so when you go to the memorial,
851.34	you can actually see the overarching organization
853.99	inside of the individual pools themselves.
856.874	You can see the way that the geography of the event
859.244	is reflected inside of the memorial,
862.127	and you can search for an individual name,
863.955	or in this case an employer, Cantor Fitzgerald,
866.53	and see the way in which all of those names,
868.926	those hundreds of names, are actually organized
871.036	onto the memorial itself,
872.728	and use that to navigate the memorial.
875.346	And more importantly, when you're actually at the site
877.282	of the memorial, you can see those connections.
878.761	You can see the relationships between the different names themselves.
882.381	So suddenly what is this undifferentiated, anonymous
885.65	group of names springs into reality as an individual life.
890.328	In this case, Harry Ramos,
892.496	who was the head trader at an investment bank,
894.835	who stopped to aid Victor Wald on the 55th floor of the South Tower.
899.873	And Ramos told Wald, according to witnesses,
902.558	"""I'm not going to leave you."""
905.028	And Wald's widow requested that they be listed next to each other.
910.604	Three generations ago, we had to actually get people
913.806	to go out and capture the stories for common people.
917.203	Today, of course, there's an unprecedented amount of stories
920.671	for all of us that are being captured for future generations.
924.569	And this is our hope, that's there's poetry inside of each of our stories.
928.097	Thank you very much.
929.021	(Applause)
