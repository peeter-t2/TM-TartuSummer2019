18.906	So, this is my grandfather,
21.872	Salman Schocken,
23.373	who was born into a poor and uneducated family
27.81	with six children to feed,
31.247	and when he was 14 years old, he was forced to
34.943	drop out of school in order to help put bread on the table.
38.903	He never went back to school.
42.323	Instead, he went on to build a glittering empire
46.47	of department stores.
48.578	Salman was the consummate perfectionist,
51.831	and every one of his stores was a jewel
54.395	of Bauhaus architecture.
56.324	He was also the ultimate self-learner,
59.514	and like everything else, he did it in grand style.
62.417	He surrounded himself with an entourage
65.105	of young, unknown scholars like Martin Buber
68.492	and Shai Agnon and Franz Kafka,
71.631	and he paid each one of them a monthly salary
74.556	so that they could write in peace.
77.607	And yet, in the late '30s, Salman saw what's coming.
82.544	He fled Germany, together with his family,
85.858	leaving everything else behind.
87.947	His department stores confiscated,
91.157	he spent the rest of his life in a relentless pursuit
94.246	of art and culture.
96.715	This high school dropout
98.654	died at the age of 82,
100.934	a formidable intellectual, cofounder and first CEO
105.063	of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,
107.208	and founder of Schocken Books,
108.972	an acclaimed imprint that was later acquired
112.343	by Random House.
114.013	Such is the power of self-study.
117.989	And these are my parents.
120.505	They too did not enjoy the privilege of college education.
124.552	They were too busy building a family and a country.
128.523	And yet, just like Salman, they were lifelong,
132.551	tenacious self-learners, and our home was stacked
136.309	with thousands of books, records and artwork.
140.472	I remember quite vividly my father telling me
142.868	that when everyone in the neighborhood will have a TV set,
147.7	then we'll buy a normal F.M. radio. (Laughter)
152.318	And that's me,
155.347	I was going to say holding my first abacus,
157.071	but actually holding what my father would consider
160.082	an ample substitute to an iPad. (Laughter)
163.034	So one thing that I took from home is this notion
166.696	that educators don't necessarily have to teach.
169.537	Instead, they can provide an environment and resources
172.766	that tease out your natural ability to learn on your own.
177.914	Self-study, self-exploration, self-empowerment:
182.008	these are the virtues of a great education.
185.328	So I'd like to share with you a story about a self-study,
189.523	self-empowering computer science course
192.077	that I built, together with my brilliant colleague Noam Nisan.
196.263	As you can see from the pictures, both Noam and I
199.02	had an early fascination with first principles,
202.438	and over the years, as our knowledge of
203.96	science and technology became more sophisticated,
207.535	this early awe with the basics
210.731	has only intensified.
212.831	So it's not surprising that, about 12 years ago, when
216.53	Noam and I were already computer science professors,
220.012	we were equally frustrated by the same phenomenon.
223.764	As computers became increasingly more complex,
226.582	our students were losing the forest for the trees,
229.786	and indeed, it is impossible to connect
232.873	with the soul of the machine if you interact
235.515	with a black box P.C. or a Mac which is shrouded
238.924	by numerous layers of closed, proprietary software.
242.3	So Noam and I had this insight that if we want our students
245.99	to understand how computers work,
248.009	and understand it in the marrow of their bones,
251.097	then perhaps the best way to go about it
252.658	is to have them build a complete, working,
257.252	general-purpose, useful computer, hardware and software,
260.964	from the ground up, from first principles.
264.494	Now, we had to start somewhere, and so Noam and I
268.702	decided to base our cathedral, so to speak,
272.192	on the simplest possible building block,
275.331	which is something called NAND.
278.132	It is nothing more than a trivial logic gate
282.07	with four input-output states.
285.108	So we now start this journey by telling our students
287.774	that God gave us NAND — (Laughter) —
289.842	and told us to build a computer, and when we asked how,
293.827	"God said, ""One step at a time."""
297.011	And then, following this advice, we start
300.104	with this lowly, humble NAND gate,
303.063	and we walk our students through an elaborate sequence
305.003	of projects in which they gradually build a chip set,
308.74	a hardware platform, an assembler, a virtual machine,
312.852	a basic operating system and a compiler
316.429	"for a simple, Java-like language that we call ""JACK."""
322.618	The students celebrate the end of this tour de force
325.166	by using JACK to write all sorts of cool games
328	like Pong, Snake and Tetris.
330.992	You can imagine the tremendous joy of playing
334.607	with a Tetris game that you wrote in JACK
337.631	and then compiled into machine language in a compiler
340.421	that you wrote also, and then seeing the result
342.829	running on a machine that you built starting
345.712	with nothing more than a few thousand NAND gates.
348.996	It's a tremendous personal triumph of going
352.186	from first principles all the way to a fantastically complex
356.911	and useful system.
359.262	Noam and I worked five years to facilitate
363.659	this ascent and to create the tools and infrastructure
366.867	that will enable students to build it in one semester.
370.04	And this is the great team that helped us make it happen.
374.079	The trick was to decompose the computer's construction
378.326	into numerous stand-alone modules,
381.28	each of which could be individually specified,
385.18	built and unit-tested in isolation from the rest of the project.
390.415	And from day one, Noam and I decided to put
393.404	all these building blocks freely available in open source
396.94	on the Web.
398.42	So chip specifications, APIs, project descriptions,
402.891	software tools, hardware simulators, CPU emulators,
406.795	stacks of hundreds of slides, lectures --
410.497	we laid out everything on the Web
412.724	and invited the world to come over,
415.751	take whatever they need,
417.287	and do whatever they want with it.
419.677	And then something fascinating happened.
423.576	The world came.
425.159	And in short order, thousands of people
428.317	were building our machine.
429.861	And NAND2Tetris became one of the first
433.785	massive, open, online courses,
437.015	although seven years ago we had no idea that what
439.759	we were doing is called MOOCs.
441.92	We just observed how self-organized courses
445.778	were kind of spontaneously spawning
448.86	out of our materials.
450.243	For example, Pramode C.E.,
453.334	an engineer from Kerala, India,
455.243	has organized groups of self-learners
457.052	who build our computer under his good guidance.
460.096	And Parag Shah, another engineer, from Mumbai,
463.118	has unbundled our projects into smaller,
465.963	more manageable bites that he now serves
467.985	in his pioneering do-it-yourself computer science program.
471.787	The people who are attracted to these courses
475.198	typically have a hacker mentality.
477.618	They want to figure out how things work,
479.723	and they want to do it in groups,
481.483	like this hackers club in Washington, D.C.,
484.294	that uses our materials to offer community courses.
487.959	And because these materials are widely available
490.905	and open-source, different people take them
493.599	to very different and unpredictable directions.
496.542	For example, Yu Fangmin, from Guangzhou,
499.455	has used FPGA technology
502.301	to build our computer and show others how to do the same
506.026	using a video clip, and Ben Craddock developed
509.389	a very nice computer game that unfolds
512.99	inside our CPU architecture, which is quite a complex
517.959	3D maze that Ben developed
520.444	using the Minecraft 3D simulator engine.
524.352	The Minecraft community went bananas over this project,
527.37	and Ben became an instant media celebrity.
530.754	And indeed, for quite a few people,
533.656	taking this NAND2Tetris pilgrimage, if you will,
537.733	has turned into a life-changing experience.
540.445	For example, take Dan Rounds, who is a music
543.634	and math major from East Lansing, Michigan.
546.403	A few weeks ago, Dan posted a victorious post
549.847	on our website, and I'd like to read it to you.
552.467	So here's what Dan said.
555.925	"""I did the coursework because understanding computers"
558.737	is important to me, just like literacy and numeracy,
562.083	and I made it through. I never worked harder on anything,
565.1	never been challenged to this degree.
567.809	But given what I now feel capable of doing,
570.196	I would certainly do it again.
572.354	To anyone considering NAND2Tetris,
574.604	"it's a tough journey, but you'll be profoundly changed."""
578.35	So Dan demonstrates the many self-learners
583.25	who take this course off the Web, on their own traction,
587.896	on their own initiative, and it's quite amazing because
592.485	these people cannot care less about
597.072	grades.
598.314	They are doing it because of one motivation only.
602.219	They have a tremendous passion to learn.
605.705	And with that in mind,
607.629	I'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading.
612.233	I'm sick of it.
614.593	We are obsessed with grades
616.026	because we are obsessed with data,
617.892	and yet grading takes away all the fun from failing,
622.479	and a huge part of education
624.955	is about failing.
626.546	Courage, according to Churchill,
629.021	is the ability to go from one defeat to another
631.967	without losing enthusiasm. (Laughter)
634.581	And [Joyce] said that mistakes
638.411	are the portals of discovery.
639.88	And yet we don't tolerate mistakes,
643.226	and we worship grades.
644.535	So we collect your B pluses and your A minuses
648.323	and we aggregate them into a number like 3.4,
651.16	which is stamped on your forehead
653.071	and sums up who you are.
655.514	Well, in my opinion, we went too far with this nonsense,
658.797	and grading became degrading.
661.478	So with that, I'd like to say a few words about upgrading,
666.379	and share with you a glimpse from my current project,
670.804	which is different from the previous one,
672.834	but it shares exactly the same characteristics
674.848	of self-learning, learning by doing,
678.675	self-exploration and community-building,
681.45	and this project deals with K-12 math education,
687.31	beginning with early age math,
689.214	and we do it on tablets because we believe that
693.707	math, like anything else, should be taught hands on.
698.112	So here's what we do. Basically, we developed
701.267	numerous mobile apps, every one of them explaining
705.025	a particular concept in math.
706.522	So for example, let's take area.
709.963	When you deal with a concept like area --
712.435	well, we also provide a set of tools that the child
717.679	is invited to experiment with in order to learn.
720.31	So if area is what interests us, then one thing
724.263	which is natural to do is to tile the area
728.401	of this particular shape and simply count
732.051	how many tiles it takes to cover it completely.
735.914	And this little exercise here gives you a first
738.396	good insight of the notion of area.
741.825	Moving along, what about the area of this figure?
744.615	Well, if you try to tile it, it doesn't work too well, does it.
749.272	So instead, you can experiment
751.576	with these different tools here by some process
754.256	of guided trial and error,
756.295	and at some point you will discover that one thing
759.133	that you can do among several legitimate transformations
762.221	is the following one. You can cut the figure,
765.052	you can rearrange the parts, you can glue them
768.668	and then proceed to tile just like we did before.
771.785	(Applause)
777.06	Now this particular transformation
779.783	did not change the area of the original figure,
783.767	so a six-year-old who plays with this
785.954	has just discovered a clever algorithm
788.838	to compute the area of any given parallelogram.
792.878	We don't replace teachers, by the way.
794.734	We believe that teachers should be empowered, not replaced.
797.863	Moving along, what about the area of a triangle?
801.158	So after some guided trial and error,
803.953	the child will discover, with or without help,
807.888	that he or she can duplicate the original figure
811.746	and then take the result, transpose it,
815.154	glue it to the original and then proceed [with] what we did before:
818.902	cut, rearrange, paste — oops— paste and glue,
826.63	and tile.
828.226	Now this transformation has doubled the area
832.053	of the original figure, and therefore we have just learned
835.903	that the area of the triangle equals the area of this rectangle
839.669	divided by two.
842.123	But we discovered it by self-exploration.
845.571	So, in addition to learning some useful geometry,
851.651	the child has been exposed to some pretty sophisticated
856.038	science strategies, like reduction,
859.065	which is the art of
861.979	transforming a complex problem into a simple one,
865.565	or generalization, which is at the heart
867.934	of any scientific discipline,
870.777	or the fact that some properties are invariant
873.367	under some transformations.
876.391	And all this is something that a very young child
879.676	can pick up using such mobile apps.
883.985	So presently, we are doing the following:
887.079	First of all, we are decomposing the K-12 math curriculum
891.388	into numerous such apps.
894.279	And because we cannot do it on our own,
896.856	we've developed a very fancy authoring tool
899.95	that any author, any parent or actually anyone
903.225	who has an interest in math education,
905.578	can use this authoring tool to develop similar apps
908.85	on tablets without programming.
912.255	And finally, we are putting together an adaptive ecosystem
915.475	that will match different learners
918.303	with different apps according to their evolving learning style.
923.68	The driving force behind this project
926.201	is my colleague Shmulik London,
929.148	and, you see, just like
931.792	Salman did about 90 years ago,
935.865	the trick is to surround yourself with brilliant people,
939.836	because at the end,
942.592	it's all about people.
944.495	And a few years ago, I was walking in Tel Aviv
947.914	and I saw this graffiti on a wall,
950.744	and I found it so compelling
952.535	that by now I preach it to my students,
954.678	and I'd like to try to preach it to you.
956.944	Now, I don't know how many people here are familiar
958.684	"with the term ""mensch."""
960.512	It basically means to be human
963.12	and to do the right thing.
965.055	And with that, what this graffiti says is,
967.484	"""High-tech schmigh-tech."
969.57	"The most important thing is to be a mensch."" (Laughter)"
972.133	Thank you. (Applause)
975.528	(Applause)
