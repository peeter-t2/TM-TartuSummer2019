13.09	Wow, this is bright.
15.121	It must use a lot of power.
18.112	Well, flying you all in here
19.604	must have cost a bit of energy too.
22.052	So the whole planet needs a lot of energy,
24.97	and so far we've been running mostly on fossil fuel.
27.871	We've been burning gas.
29.92	It's been a good run.
31.307	It got us to where we are, but we have to stop.
34.175	We can't do that anymore.
36.329	So we are trying different types of energy now,
38.61	alternative energy,
39.824	but it proved quite difficult to find something
42.322	that's as convenient and as cost-effective
45.123	as oil, gas and coal.
47.94	My personal favorite is nuclear energy.
52.03	Now, it's very energy-dense,
54.631	it produces solid, reliable power,
57.112	and it doesn't make any CO2.
59.495	Now we know of two ways
60.987	of making nuclear energy: fission and fusion.
66.161	Now in fission, you take a big nucleus,
68.506	you break it in part, in two,
70.141	and it makes lots of energy,
71.688	and this is how the nuclear reactor today works.
73.901	It works pretty good.
75.31	And then there's fusion.
77.464	Now, I like fusion. Fusion's much better.
79.87	So you take two small nuclei,
81.564	you put it together, and you make helium,
84.07	and that's very nice.
85.428	It makes lots of energy.
86.974	This is nature's way of producing energy.
89.574	The sun and all the stars in the universe
91.982	run on fusion.
94.227	Now, a fusion plant
96.123	would actually be quite cost-effective
98.438	and it also would be quite safe.
100.428	It only produces short term radioactive waste,
104.861	and it cannot melt down.
106.893	Now, the fuel from fusion comes from the ocean.
109.42	In the ocean, you can extract the fuel
111.238	for about one thousandth of a cent
113.128	per kilowatt-hour, so that's very, very cheap.
115.459	And if the whole planet would run on fusion,
118.847	we could extract the fuel from the ocean.
120.291	It would run for billions and billions of years.
123.555	Now, if fusion is so great, why don't we have it?
127.327	Where is it?
128.663	Well, there's always a bit of a catch.
130.511	Fusion is really, really hard to do.
133.749	So the problem is, those two nuclei,
136.233	they are both positively charged,
137.861	so they don't want to fuse.
139.652	They go like this. They go like that.
141.429	So in order to make them fuse,
142.393	you have to throw them at
142.393	each other with great speed,
144.58	and if they have enough speed,
145.493	they will go against the repulsion,
147.327	they will touch, and they will make energy.
149.48	Now, the particle speed
151.887	is a measure of the temperature.
153.657	So the temperature required for fusion
155.399	is 150 billion degrees C.
158.561	This is rather warm,
160.392	and this is why fusion is so hard to do.
163.838	Now, I caught my little fusion bug
165.863	when I did my Ph.D. here at the
165.863	University of British Columbia,
169.533	and then I got a big job in a laser printer place
172.585	making printing for the printing industry.
175.123	I worked there for 10 years,
177.375	and I got a little bit bored,
179.055	and then I was 40, and I got a mid-life crisis,
182.008	you know, the usual thing:
183.641	Who am I? What should I do?
186.1	What should I do? What can I do?
188.686	And then I was looking at my good work,
190.738	and what I was doing is I was cutting the forests
192.789	around here in B.C.
194.144	and burying you, all of you,
195.738	in millions of tons of junk mail.
199.18	Now, that was not very satisfactory.
201.115	So some people buy a Porsche.
203.38	Others get a mistress.
206.151	But I've decided to get my bit
207.825	to solve global warming and make fusion happen.
212.088	Now, so the first thing I did
213.819	is I looked into the literature and I see,
216.248	how does fusion work?
218.99	So the physicists have been
218.99	working on fusion for a while,
222.132	and one of the ways they do it
223.448	is with something called a tokamak.
225.754	It's a big ring of magnetic coil,
228.484	superconducting coil,
229.81	and it makes a magnetic field
231.16	in a ring like this,
232.948	and the hot gas in the middle,
234.34	which is called a plasma, is trapped.
236.47	The particles go round and round and round
238.218	the circle at the wall.
239.658	Then they throw a huge amount of heat in there
241.186	to try to cook that to fusion temperature.
243.66	So this is the inside of one of those donuts,
245.988	and on the right side you can see
247.32	the fusion plasma in there.
249.46	Now, a second way of doing this
251.708	is by using laser fusion.
254.108	Now in laser fusion, you have a little ping pong ball,
256.228	you put the fusion fuel in the center,
258.274	and you zap that with a whole
258.274	bunch of laser around it.
261.204	The lasers are very strong, and it squashes
262.908	the ping pong ball really, really quick.
264.634	And if you squeeze something hard enough,
266.589	it gets hotter,
267.964	and if it gets really, really fast,
269.36	and they do that in one billionth of a second,
271.678	it makes enough energy and enough heat
273.581	to make fusion.
274.917	So this is the inside of one such machine.
276.994	You see the laser beam and the pellet
278.837	in the center.
280.386	Now, most people think that fusion is going nowhere.
283.348	They always think that the physicists are in their lab
286.28	and they're working hard, but nothing is happening.
288.095	That's actually not quite true.
289.615	This is a curve of the gain in fusion
291.607	over the last 30 years or so,
293.799	and you can see that we're making now
295.357	about 10,000 times more fusion than we used to
298.19	when we started.
299.264	That's a pretty good gain.
300.259	As a matter of fact, it's as fast
302.245	as the fabled Moore's Law
303.945	that defined the amount of transistors
306.149	they can put on a chip.
307.666	Now, this dot here is called JET,
310.671	the Joint European Torus.
312.094	It's a big tokamak donut in Europe,
314.524	and this machine in 1997
317.594	produced 16 megawatts of fusion power
320.818	with 17 megawatts of heat.
322.976	Now, you say, that's not much use,
324.781	but it's actually pretty close,
326.492	considering we can get
327.532	about 10,000 times more than we started.
329.839	The second dot here is the NIF.
332.452	It's the National Ignition Facility.
334.738	It's a big laser machine in the U.S.,
337.264	and last month they announced
338.541	with quite a bit of noise
340.394	that they had managed to make more fusion energy
342.552	from the fusion
344.142	than the energy that they put in 
344.142	the center of the ping pong ball.
346.998	Now, that's not quite good enough,
348.823	because the laser to put that energy in
350.523	was more energy than that,
352.255	but it was pretty good.
354.295	Now this is ITER,
356.022	pronounced in French: EE-tairh.
358.08	So this is a big collaboration of different countries
361.211	that are building a huge magnetic donut
363.066	in the south of France,
365.01	and this machine, when it's finished,
367.018	will produce 500 megawatts of fusion power
369.796	with only 50 megawatts to make it.
372.196	So this one is the real one.
373.382	It's going to work.
374.114	That's the kind of machine that makes energy.
376.306	Now if you look at the graph, you will notice
378.062	that those two dots are a little bit
379.567	on the right of the curve.
380.609	We kind of have fallen off the progress.
382.545	Actually, the science to make those machines
384.534	was really in time
386.07	to produce fusion during that curve.
388.906	However, there has been a bit of politics going on,
391.645	and the will to do it was not there,
393.777	so it drifted to the right.
395.455	ITER, for example, could have been built
397.511	in 2000 or 2005,
399.362	but because it's a big international collaboration,
401.807	the politics got in and it delayed it a bit.
404.255	For example, it took them about three years
405.879	to decide where to put it.
407.447	Now, fusion is often criticized
409.983	for being a little too expensive.
411.583	Yes, it did cost
413.124	a billion dollars or two billion dollars a year
415.16	to make this progress.
416.353	But you have to compare that to the cost
417.943	of making Moore's Law.
419.183	That cost way more than that.
421.071	The result of Moore's Law
422.589	is this cell phone here in my pocket.
424.525	This cell phone, and the Internet behind it,
426.754	cost about one trillion dollars,
429.434	just so I can take a selfie
432.665	and put it on Facebook.
435.239	Then when my dad sees that,
436.74	he'll be very proud.
439.92	We also spend about 650 billion dollars a year
443.828	in subsidies for oil and gas
446.13	and renewable energy.
447.76	Now, we spend one half of a percent of that on fusion.
451.934	So me, personally, I don't think it's too expensive.
454.582	I think it's actually been shortchanged,
456.362	considering it can solve all our energy problems
458.754	cleanly for the next couple of billions of years.
461.428	Now I can say that, but I'm a little bit biased,
464.088	because I started a fusion company
465.976	and I don't even have a Facebook account.
468.534	So when I started this fusion company in 2002,
473.917	I knew I couldn't fight with the big lads.
476.759	They had much more resources than me.
478.336	So I decided I would need to find a solution
480.576	that is cheaper and faster.
482.463	Now magnetic and laser fusion
484.373	are pretty good machines.
485.804	They are awesome pieces of technology,
487.245	wonderful machines, and they have shown
489.119	that fusion can be done.
490.598	However, as a power plant,
492.552	I don't think they're very good.
494.423	They're way too big, way too complicated,
496.48	way too expensive,
497.618	and also, they don't deal very much
499.374	with the fusion energy.
500.648	When you make fusion, the energy comes out
502.406	as neutrons, fast neutrons comes out of the plasma.
505.074	Those neutrons hit the wall of the machine.
507.334	It damages it.
508.719	And also, you have to catch
508.719	the heat from those neutrons
510.683	and run some steam to spin a turbine somewhere,
513.116	and on those machines,
514.4	it was all a bit of an afterthought.
517.031	So I decided that surely there
517.031	is a better way of doing that.
520.182	So back to the literature,
521.466	and I read about the fusion everywhere.
523.458	One way in particular attracted my attention,
526.18	and it's called magnetized target fusion,
528.27	or MTF for short.
530.858	Now, in MTF, what you want to do
533.3	is you take a big vat
535.27	and you fill that with liquid metal,
537.286	and you spin the liquid metal
538.806	to open a vortex in the center,
540.454	a bit like your sink.
541.59	When you pull the plug on a sink, it makes a vortex.
543.694	And then you have some pistons driven by pressure
546.09	that goes on the outside,
547.566	and this compresses the liquid metal
549.486	around the plasma, and it compresses it,
551.248	it gets hotter, like a laser,
552.902	and then it makes fusion.
554.128	So it's a bit of a mix
555.048	between a magnetized fusion
556.703	and the laser fusion.
558.686	So those have a couple of very good advantages.
561.459	The liquid metal absorbs all the neutrons
563.802	and no neutrons hit the wall,
565.558	and therefore there's no damage to the machine.
567.694	The liquid metal gets hot,
569.15	so you can pump that in a heat exchanger,
571.15	make some steam, spin a turbine.
573.03	So that's a very convenient way of doing
574.209	this part of the process.
575.469	And finally, all the energy to make the fusion happen
579.06	comes from steam-powered pistons,
581.195	which is way cheaper than lasers
582.851	or superconducting coils.
584.745	Now, this was all very good
586.233	except for the problem that it didn't quite work.
588.737	(Laughter)
590.607	There's always a catch.
591.903	So when you compress that,
593.417	the plasma cools down
595.341	faster than the compression speed,
596.969	so you're trying to compress it,
598.282	but the plasma cooled down and
598.282	cooled down and cooled down
600.617	and then it did absolutely nothing.
602.558	So when I saw that, I said,
602.558	well, this is such a shame,
604.593	because it's a very, very good idea.
606.343	So hopefully I can improve on that.
608.697	So I thought about it for a minute,
609.792	and I said, okay, how can we make that work better?
611.869	So then I thought about impact.
613.727	What about if we use a big hammer
615.561	and we swing it and we hit the nail like this,
618.093	in the place of putting the hammer on the nail
620.067	and pushing and try to put it in? That won't work.
622.262	So what the idea is
624.193	is to use the idea of an impact.
625.937	So we accelerate the pistons with steam,
628.019	that takes a little bit of time,
629.298	but then, bang! you hit the piston,
631.281	and, baff!, all the energy is done instantly,
633.833	down instantly to the liquid,
635.429	and that compresses the plasma much faster.
637.479	So I decided, okay, this is good, let's make that.
639.927	So we built this machine in this garage here.
643.652	We made a small machine
644.737	that we managed to squeeze
646.709	a little bit of neutrons out of that,
648.357	and those are my marketing neutrons,
650.558	and with those marketing neutrons,
652.001	then I raised about 50 million dollars,
654.6	and I hired 65 people. That's my team here.
657.49	And this is what we want to build.
659.072	So it's going to be a big machine,
660.586	about three meters in diameter,
662.06	liquid lead spinning around,
663.862	big vortex in the center,
665.454	put the plasma on the top and on the bottom,
667.774	piston hits on the side,
669.2	bang!, it compresses it,
670.71	and it will make some energy,
671.994	and the neutron will come out in the liquid metal,
674.386	going to go in a steam engine and make the turbine,
676.986	and some of the steam will go back
678.492	to fire the piston.
679.49	We're going to run that about one time per second,
681.38	and it will produce 100 megawatts of electricity.
686.764	Okay, we also built this injector,
688.449	so this injector makes the plasma to start with.
690.736	It makes the plasma at about
692.451	a lukewarm temperature of three million degrees C.
696.426	Unfortunately, it doesn't last quite long enough,
698.633	so we need to extend the life
698.633	of the plasma a little bit,
701.768	but last month it got a lot better,
703.4	so I think we have the plasma compressing now.
705.985	Then we built a small sphere, about this big,
710.007	and this will compress the liquid.
712.331	However, plasma is difficult to compress.
714.436	When you compress it,
715.225	it tends to go a little bit crooked like that,
717.777	so you need the timing of the piston
719.385	to be very good,
720.481	and for that we use several control systems,
723.153	which was not possible in 1970,
725.355	but we now can do that
726.747	with nice, new electronics.
730.039	So finally, most people think that fusion
732.568	is in the future and will never happen,
734.72	but as a matter of fact, fusion is getting very close.
737.814	We are almost there.
738.89	The big labs have shown that fusion is doable,
741.527	and now there are small companies
741.527	that are thinking about that,
743.834	and they say, it's not that it cannot be done,
746.195	but it's how to make it cost-effectively.
748.3	General Fusion is one of those small companies,
750.453	and hopefully, very soon, somebody, someone,
753.771	will crack that nut,
755.054	and perhaps it will be General Fusion.
756.628	Thank you very much.
758.407	(Applause)
