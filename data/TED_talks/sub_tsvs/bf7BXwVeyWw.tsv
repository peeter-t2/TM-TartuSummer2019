15.26	A few months ago
17.26	the Nobel Prize in physics
19.26	was awarded to two teams of astronomers
21.26	for a discovery that has been hailed
24.26	as one of the most important
26.26	astronomical observations ever.
28.26	And today, after briefly describing what they found,
30.26	I'm going to tell you about a highly controversial framework
33.26	for explaining their discovery,
36.26	namely the possibility
38.26	that way beyond the Earth,
40.26	the Milky Way and other distant galaxies,
43.26	we may find that our universe
45.26	is not the only universe,
47.26	but is instead
49.26	part of a vast complex of universes
51.26	that we call the multiverse.
53.26	Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one.
56.26	I mean, most of us were raised to believe
58.26	"that the word ""universe"" means everything."
61.26	And I say most of us with forethought,
64.26	as my four-year-old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born.
67.26	And last year I was holding her
69.26	"and I said, ""Sophia,"
71.26	"I love you more than anything in the universe."""
74.26	"And she turned to me and said, ""Daddy,"
76.26	"universe or multiverse?"""
78.26	(Laughter)
81.26	But barring such an anomalous upbringing,
84.26	it is strange to imagine
86.26	other realms separate from ours,
88.26	most with fundamentally different features,
90.26	that would rightly be called universes of their own.
93.26	And yet,
95.26	speculative though the idea surely is,
97.26	I aim to convince you
99.26	that there's reason for taking it seriously,
101.26	as it just might be right.
103.26	I'm going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts.
106.26	In part one,
108.26	I'm going to describe those Nobel Prize-winning results
110.26	and to highlight a profound mystery
112.26	which those results revealed.
114.26	In part two,
116.26	I'll offer a solution to that mystery.
118.26	It's based on an approach called string theory,
120.26	and that's where the idea of the multiverse
122.26	will come into the story.
124.26	Finally, in part three,
126.26	I'm going to describe a cosmological theory
128.26	called inflation,
130.26	which will pull all the pieces of the story together.
133.26	Okay, part one starts back in 1929
137.26	when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble
139.26	realized that the distant galaxies
142.26	were all rushing away from us,
144.26	establishing that space itself is stretching,
146.26	it's expanding.
148.26	Now this was revolutionary.
151.26	The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales
154.26	the universe was static.
156.26	But even so,
158.26	there was one thing that everyone was certain of:
161.26	The expansion must be slowing down.
164.26	That, much as the gravitational pull of the Earth
167.26	slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward,
170.26	the gravitational pull
172.26	of each galaxy on every other
174.26	must be slowing
176.26	the expansion of space.
178.26	Now let's fast-forward to the 1990s
181.26	when those two teams of astronomers
183.26	I mentioned at the outset
185.26	were inspired by this reasoning
187.26	to measure the rate
189.26	at which the expansion has been slowing.
191.26	And they did this
193.26	by painstaking observations
195.26	of numerous distant galaxies,
197.26	allowing them to chart
199.26	how the expansion rate has changed over time.
202.26	Here's the surprise:
205.26	They found that the expansion is not slowing down.
208.26	Instead they found that it's speeding up,
210.26	going faster and faster.
212.26	That's like tossing an apple upward
214.26	and it goes up faster and faster.
216.26	Now if you saw an apple do that,
218.26	you'd want to know why.
220.26	What's pushing on it?
222.26	Similarly, the astronomers' results
224.26	are surely well-deserving of the Nobel Prize,
227.26	but they raised an analogous question.
231.26	What force is driving all galaxies
233.26	to rush away from every other
236.26	at an ever-quickening speed?
239.26	Well the most promising answer
241.26	comes from an old idea of Einstein's.
244.26	You see, we are all used to gravity
246.26	being a force that does one thing,
249.26	pulls objects together.
251.26	But in Einstein's theory of gravity,
253.26	his general theory of relativity,
255.26	gravity can also push things apart.
258.26	How? Well according to Einstein's math,
261.26	if space is uniformly filled
263.26	with an invisible energy,
265.26	sort of like a uniform, invisible mist,
268.26	then the gravity generated by that mist
271.26	would be repulsive,
273.26	repulsive gravity,
275.26	which is just what we need to explain the observations.
278.26	Because the repulsive gravity
280.26	of an invisible energy in space --
282.26	we now call it dark energy,
284.26	but I've made it smokey white here so you can see it --
287.26	its repulsive gravity
289.26	would cause each galaxy to push against every other,
291.26	driving expansion to speed up,
293.26	not slow down.
295.26	And this explanation
297.26	represents great progress.
299.26	But I promised you a mystery
302.26	here in part one.
304.26	Here it is.
306.26	When the astronomers worked out
308.26	how much of this dark energy
311.26	must be infusing space
313.26	to account for the cosmic speed up,
315.26	look at what they found.
324.26	This number is small.
326.26	Expressed in the relevant unit,
328.26	it is spectacularly small.
330.26	And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number.
333.26	We want this number
335.26	to emerge from the laws of physics,
337.26	but so far no one has found a way to do that.
340.26	Now you might wonder,
343.26	should you care?
345.26	Maybe explaining this number
347.26	is just a technical issue,
349.26	a technical detail of interest to experts,
352.26	but of no relevance to anybody else.
354.26	Well it surely is a technical detail,
357.26	but some details really matter.
359.26	Some details provide
361.26	windows into uncharted realms of reality,
363.26	and this peculiar number may be doing just that,
366.26	as the only approach that's so far made headway to explain it
369.26	invokes the possibility of other universes --
372.26	an idea that naturally emerges from string theory,
375.26	which takes me to part two: string theory.
378.26	So hold the mystery of the dark energy
382.26	in the back of your mind
384.26	as I now go on to tell you
386.26	three key things about string theory.
389.26	First off, what is it?
391.26	Well it's an approach to realize Einstein's dream
394.26	of a unified theory of physics,
397.26	a single overarching framework
399.26	that would be able to describe
401.26	all the forces at work in the universe.
403.26	And the central idea of string theory
405.26	is quite straightforward.
407.26	It says that if you examine
409.26	any piece of matter ever more finely,
411.26	at first you'll find molecules
413.26	and then you'll find atoms and subatomic particles.
416.26	But the theory says that if you could probe smaller,
418.26	much smaller than we can with existing technology,
421.26	you'd find something else inside these particles --
424.26	a little tiny vibrating filament of energy,
427.26	a little tiny vibrating string.
430.26	And just like the strings on a violin,
432.26	they can vibrate in different patterns
434.26	producing different musical notes.
436.26	These little fundamental strings,
438.26	when they vibrate in different patterns,
440.26	they produce different kinds of particles --
442.26	so electrons, quarks, neutrinos, photons,
444.26	all other particles
446.26	would be united into a single framework,
448.26	as they would all arise from vibrating strings.
451.26	It's a compelling picture,
454.26	a kind of cosmic symphony,
456.26	where all the richness
458.26	that we see in the world around us
460.26	emerges from the music
462.26	that these little, tiny strings can play.
465.26	But there's a cost
467.26	to this elegant unification,
469.26	because years of research
471.26	have shown that the math of string theory doesn't quite work.
474.26	It has internal inconsistencies,
476.26	unless we allow
478.26	for something wholly unfamiliar --
481.26	extra dimensions of space.
484.26	That is, we all know about the usual three dimensions of space.
487.26	And you can think about those
489.26	as height, width and depth.
492.26	But string theory says that, on fantastically small scales,
495.26	there are additional dimensions
497.26	crumpled to a tiny size so small
499.26	that we have not detected them.
501.26	But even though the dimensions are hidden,
503.26	they would have an impact on things that we can observe
506.26	because the shape of the extra dimensions
509.26	constrains how the strings can vibrate.
512.26	And in string theory,
514.26	vibration determines everything.
517.26	So particle masses, the strengths of forces,
519.26	and most importantly, the amount of dark energy
522.26	would be determined
524.26	by the shape of the extra dimensions.
526.26	So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions,
529.26	we should be able to calculate these features,
532.26	calculate the amount of dark energy.
535.26	The challenge
537.26	is we don't know
539.26	the shape of the extra dimensions.
542.26	All we have
544.26	is a list of candidate shapes
546.26	allowed by the math.
549.26	Now when these ideas were first developed,
551.26	there were only about five different candidate shapes,
553.26	so you can imagine
555.26	analyzing them one-by-one
557.26	to determine if any yield
559.26	the physical features we observe.
561.26	But over time the list grew
563.26	as researchers found other candidate shapes.
565.26	From five, the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands --
568.26	A large, but still manageable, collection to analyze,
571.26	since after all,
573.26	graduate students need something to do.
576.26	But then the list continued to grow
578.26	into the millions and the billions, until today.
581.26	The list of candidate shapes
583.26	has soared to about 10 to the 500.
588.26	So, what to do?
591.26	Well some researchers lost heart,
594.26	concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions,
597.26	each giving rise to different physical features,
600.26	string theory would never make
602.26	definitive, testable predictions.
604.26	But others turned this issue on its head,
608.26	taking us to the possibility of a multiverse.
610.26	Here's the idea.
612.26	Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other.
615.26	Each is as real as every other,
617.26	in the sense
619.26	that there are many universes,
621.26	each with a different shape, for the extra dimensions.
624.26	And this radical proposal
626.26	has a profound impact on this mystery:
629.26	the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize-winning results.
632.26	Because you see,
634.26	if there are other universes,
637.26	and if those universes
639.26	each have, say, a different shape for the extra dimensions,
643.26	then the physical features of each universe will be different,
645.26	and in particular,
647.26	the amount of dark energy in each universe
649.26	will be different.
651.26	Which means that the mystery
653.26	of explaining the amount of dark energy we've now measured
655.26	would take on a wholly different character.
658.26	In this context,
660.26	the laws of physics can't explain one number for the dark energy
663.26	because there isn't just one number,
666.26	there are many numbers.
668.26	Which means
670.26	we have been asking the wrong question.
673.26	It's that the right question to ask is,
675.26	why do we humans find ourselves in a universe
678.26	with a particular amount of dark energy we've measured
681.26	instead of any of the other possibilities
684.26	that are out there?
686.26	And that's a question on which we can make headway.
689.26	Because those universes
691.26	that have much more dark energy than ours,
693.26	whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies,
696.26	the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong
699.26	that it blows the clump apart
701.26	and galaxies don't form.
703.26	And in those universes that have much less dark energy,
706.26	well they collapse back on themselves so quickly
708.26	that, again, galaxies don't form.
711.26	And without galaxies, there are no stars, no planets
714.26	and no chance
716.26	for our form of life
718.26	to exist in those other universes.
720.26	So we find ourselves in a universe
722.26	with the particular amount of dark energy we've measured
725.26	simply because our universe has conditions
728.26	hospitable to our form of life.
732.26	And that would be that.
734.26	Mystery solved,
736.26	multiverse found.
738.26	Now some find this explanation unsatisfying.
743.26	We're used to physics
745.26	giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe.
748.26	But the point is,
750.26	if the feature you're observing
753.26	can and does take on
755.26	a wide variety of different values
757.26	across the wider landscape of reality,
760.26	then thinking one explanation
762.26	for a particular value
764.26	is simply misguided.
767.26	An early example
769.26	comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler
772.26	who was obsessed with understanding
774.26	a different number --
776.26	why the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth.
780.26	And he worked for decades trying to explain this number,
783.26	but he never succeeded, and we know why.
786.26	Kepler was asking
788.26	the wrong question.
790.26	We now know that there are many planets
793.26	at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars.
796.26	So hoping that the laws of physics
799.26	will explain one particular number, 93 million miles,
802.26	well that is simply wrongheaded.
805.26	Instead the right question to ask is,
807.26	why do we humans find ourselves on a planet
810.26	at this particular distance,
812.26	instead of any of the other possibilities?
815.26	And again, that's a question we can answer.
818.26	Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun
821.26	would be so hot
823.26	that our form of life wouldn't exist.
825.26	And those planets that are much farther away from the star,
828.26	well they're so cold
830.26	that, again, our form of life would not take hold.
832.26	So we find ourselves
834.26	on a planet at this particular distance
836.26	simply because it yields conditions
838.26	vital to our form of life.
841.26	And when it comes to planets and their distances,
844.26	this clearly is the right kind of reasoning.
848.26	The point is,
850.26	when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain,
853.26	it may also be the right kind of reasoning.
857.26	One key difference, of course,
860.26	is we know that there are other planets out there,
862.26	but so far I've only speculated on the possibility
865.26	that there might be other universes.
867.26	So to pull it all together,
869.26	we need a mechanism
871.26	that can actually generate other universes.
874.26	And that takes me to my final part, part three.
877.26	Because such a mechanism has been found
880.26	by cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang.
883.26	You see, when we speak of the Big Bang,
885.26	we often have an image
887.26	of a kind of cosmic explosion
889.26	that created our universe
891.26	and set space rushing outward.
894.26	But there's a little secret.
896.26	The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important,
899.26	the Bang.
901.26	It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang,
904.26	but gives us no insight
906.26	into what would have powered the Bang itself.
910.26	And this gap was finally filled
912.26	by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory.
914.26	It's called inflationary cosmology,
917.26	which identified a particular kind of fuel
921.26	that would naturally generate
923.26	an outward rush of space.
925.26	The fuel is based on something called a quantum field,
928.26	but the only detail that matters for us
931.26	is that this fuel proves to be so efficient
934.26	that it's virtually impossible
936.26	to use it all up,
938.26	which means in the inflationary theory,
940.26	the Big Bang giving rise to our universe
943.26	is likely not a one-time event.
946.26	Instead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang,
949.26	but it would also generate countless other Big Bangs,
955.26	each giving rise to its own separate universe
958.26	with our universe becoming but one bubble
960.26	in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes.
963.26	And now, when we meld this with string theory,
965.26	here's the picture we're led to.
967.26	Each of these universes has extra dimensions.
969.26	The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes.
972.26	The different shapes yield different physical features.
975.26	And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another
978.26	simply because it's only in our universe
981.26	that the physical features, like the amount of dark energy,
984.26	are right for our form of life to take hold.
988.26	And this is the compelling but highly controversial picture
991.26	of the wider cosmos
993.26	that cutting-edge observation and theory
995.26	have now led us to seriously consider.
999.26	One big remaining question, of course, is,
1003.26	could we ever confirm
1006.26	the existence of other universes?
1009.26	Well let me describe
1011.26	one way that might one day happen.
1014.26	The inflationary theory
1016.26	already has strong observational support.
1018.26	Because the theory predicts
1020.26	that the Big Bang would have been so intense
1022.26	that as space rapidly expanded,
1025.26	tiny quantum jitters from the micro world
1027.26	would have been stretched out to the macro world,
1030.26	yielding a distinctive fingerprint,
1033.26	a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots,
1035.26	across space,
1037.26	which powerful telescopes have now observed.
1040.26	Going further, if there are other universes,
1043.26	the theory predicts that every so often
1045.26	those universes can collide.
1047.26	And if our universe got hit by another,
1049.26	that collision
1051.26	would generate an additional subtle pattern
1053.26	of temperature variations across space
1055.26	that we might one day
1057.26	be able to detect.
1059.26	And so exotic as this picture is,
1062.26	it may one day be grounded
1064.26	in observations,
1066.26	establishing the existence of other universes.
1069.26	I'll conclude
1071.26	with a striking implication
1074.26	of all these ideas
1076.26	for the very far future.
1078.26	You see, we learned
1080.26	that our universe is not static,
1082.26	that space is expanding,
1084.26	that that expansion is speeding up
1086.26	and that there might be other universes
1088.26	all by carefully examining
1090.26	faint pinpoints of starlight
1092.26	coming to us from distant galaxies.
1095.26	But because the expansion is speeding up,
1098.26	in the very far future,
1100.26	those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast
1103.26	that we won't be able to see them --
1106.26	not because of technological limitations,
1108.26	but because of the laws of physics.
1110.26	The light those galaxies emit,
1112.26	even traveling at the fastest speed, the speed of light,
1115.26	will not be able to overcome
1117.26	the ever-widening gulf between us.
1120.26	So astronomers in the far future
1122.26	looking out into deep space
1124.26	will see nothing but an endless stretch
1127.26	of static, inky, black stillness.
1131.26	And they will conclude
1133.26	that the universe is static and unchanging
1135.26	and populated by a single central oasis of matter
1138.26	that they inhabit --
1140.26	a picture of the cosmos
1142.26	that we definitively know to be wrong.
1145.26	Now maybe those future astronomers will have records
1148.26	handed down from an earlier era,
1150.26	like ours,
1152.26	attesting to an expanding cosmos
1154.26	teeming with galaxies.
1156.26	But would those future astronomers
1158.26	believe such ancient knowledge?
1161.26	Or would they believe
1163.26	in the black, static empty universe
1166.26	that their own state-of-the-art observations reveal?
1170.26	I suspect the latter.
1172.26	Which means that we are living
1174.26	through a remarkably privileged era
1177.26	when certain deep truths about the cosmos
1179.26	are still within reach
1181.26	of the human spirit of exploration.
1183.26	It appears that it may not always be that way.
1188.26	Because today's astronomers,
1190.26	by turning powerful telescopes to the sky,
1193.26	have captured a handful of starkly informative photons --
1196.26	a kind of cosmic telegram
1199.26	billions of years in transit.
1201.26	and the message echoing across the ages is clear.
1205.26	Sometimes nature guards her secrets
1208.26	with the unbreakable grip
1210.26	of physical law.
1212.26	Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons
1216.26	from just beyond the horizon.
1219.26	Thank you very much.
1221.26	(Applause)
1225.26	Chris Anderson: Brian, thank you.
1227.26	The range of ideas you've just spoken about
1229.26	are dizzying, exhilarating, incredible.
1232.26	How do you think
1234.26	of where cosmology is now,
1236.26	in a sort of historical side?
1238.26	Are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion?
1241.26	BG: Well it's hard to say.
1243.26	When we learn that astronomers of the far future
1246.26	may not have enough information to figure things out,
1249.26	the natural question is, maybe we're already in that position
1252.26	and certain deep, critical features of the universe
1255.26	already have escaped our ability to understand
1258.26	because of how cosmology evolves.
1260.26	So from that perspective,
1262.26	maybe we will always be asking questions
1264.26	and never be able to fully answer them.
1266.26	On the other hand, we now can understand
1268.26	how old the universe is.
1270.26	We can understand
1272.26	how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation
1275.26	that was set down 13.72 billion years ago --
1278.26	and yet, we can do calculations today to predict how it will look
1280.26	and it matches.
1282.26	Holy cow! That's just amazing.
1284.26	So on the one hand, it's just incredible where we've gotten,
1287.26	but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future.
1291.26	CA: You're going to be around for the next few days.
1294.26	Maybe some of these conversations can continue.
1296.26	Thank you. Thank you, Brian. (BG: My pleasure.)
1298.26	(Applause)
