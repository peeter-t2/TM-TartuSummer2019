12.58	We live in a time of fear,
15.62	and our response to fear
15.62	can either be to contract
19.02	and attempt to guard ourselves
21.82	or to extend ourselves,
21.82	hold on to each other,
24.98	and face our fears together.
27.98	What is your instinct?
30.5	What do you see more of in the world?
34.06	The problem with the first approach
36.06	is that in our mounting isolation,
38.42	we divide ourselves from others.
41.06	Our sense of isolation grows,
43.5	because our imagination
43.5	goes into overdrive
45.66	about the people and the spaces
45.66	that we no longer engage with.
49.22	Our sense of otherness grows,
49.22	and we lose empathy.
54.38	Today I'm going to tell you
54.38	about a group of people
56.82	that took the global
56.82	challenge of terrorism
58.98	and began creating spaces
58.98	where strangers connect in solidarity.
64.74	My own obsession with what I see
64.74	as irrational divisions began as a child.
69.66	As a fourth-generation
69.66	Kenyan Muslim of Indian origin,
73.86	it bothered me that in four generations,
75.82	there wasn't a single
75.82	marriage in my family
77.9	outside of my small religious community.
80.7	And I wondered what that was about.
83.42	Was it fear?
85.22	Was it racism?
88.06	Was it cultural preservation?
90.58	Did it have something
90.58	to do with colonialism?
94.06	Certainly, we didn't share a lot
94.06	of the same public spaces with others.
99.5	These divisions bothered me deeply,
99.5	and they drove my career choices.
104.22	When I was 20, the US embassies
104.22	in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed.
110.9	A year later, I was on my way
110.9	to the Middle East
113.18	to study conflict resolution.
115.7	And then from that point on,
117.1	it wasn't very hard for me
117.1	to find insecure environments to work in,
120.66	because the world was quickly shifting
122.54	in what we now know
122.54	as the time of terrorism.
125.74	I was in Washington, DC
125.74	when 9/11 happened,
129.02	and then I moved back home
129.02	to Kenya to work with refugees
132.5	and then later worked in Pakistan
134.66	and in Afghanistan.
137.94	In all of these places, what I noticed
140.62	was how important physical spaces are
143.18	to making us feel safe
145.58	and well
146.9	and like we belong.
149.58	In 2013, I came back home
149.58	to Nairobi from Afghanistan.
154.46	Al-Shabaab operatives
154.46	had besieged Westgate shopping center,
157.62	killing 67 people
157.62	in a day of utter horror.
163.86	Soon after that,
165.78	I could see how Nairobi
165.78	was beginning to change,
168.26	and it was beginning to feel
168.26	more like the fear and terror-weary
173.22	and war-torn cities that I had worked in.
177.06	And Nairobi continues to grow
177.06	in fear-driven ways.
181.14	We see more walls, more barriers,
183.7	more security.
185.82	And like other parts of the world,
187.5	we are experiencing
187.5	an erosion of human connection.
192.14	Divisions along
192.14	religious lines are deepening,
195.26	and we're doubting more and more
195.26	how much we have in common.
200.42	We are at a pivotal time
201.74	when we need to restore
201.74	our confidence in humanity
205.3	and stand boldly and visibly together.
209.7	So in 2014, I brought together
209.7	a group of people in Nairobi
212.5	to figure out what to do:
214.5	public intellectuals, diplomats,
214.5	artists, development workers.
220.34	And the group articulated
220.34	our challenge as threefold:
224.82	one, to reclaim the city
224.82	from the narrative of terrorism
228.78	and back into the hands
228.78	of the people that live there;
232.02	two, introduce a language
232.02	beyond race, tribe or religion
236.1	that would help us
236.1	transcend our differences;
239.5	and three, provide a gesture
239.5	that would help restore empathy
244.06	and conversation and trust.
248.34	One of the people in this group
248.34	was an artist and architect,
251.34	Yazmany Arboleda.
253.86	He and I have collaborated
253.86	in other parts of the world
256.66	over many years.
258.26	He has a history
259.82	of disrupting urban environments
262.38	and making strangers connect
264.06	in incredible, beautiful
264.06	and spectacular ways.
268.7	He had an idea.
270.46	The idea was to unite people
270.46	of different faiths
273.62	by getting them to paint
273.62	each other's houses of worship,
276.82	mosques, temples, synagogues, churches,
280.54	paint them yellow
282.5	in the name of love.
285.98	By focusing on icons of faith,
289.34	we would get people to reexamine
289.34	the true essence of their faith,
293.42	the common belief that we share
293.42	in kindness, generosity and friendship.
298.62	By creating pathways
298.62	between houses of worship
301.66	within one neighborhood,
303.3	we would create islands of stability
305.22	and networks of people
306.66	that could withstand threats.
309.98	And neighbors, by picking up
309.98	a paintbrush with other neighbors,
314.54	would engage not just with their heads
316.58	but with their hands
316.58	and with their hearts.
320.14	And the painted buildings would become
320.14	sculptures in the landscape
323.3	that speak of people
323.3	from very different backgrounds
325.98	that stand together.
329.34	"We'd call the project ""Colour in Faith."""
332.22	We loved the idea and we immediately
332.22	began approaching houses of worship:
336.3	churches, temples, mosques, synagogues.
339.1	Door to door, we went
339.1	to more than 60 rabbis,
341.78	imams, pastors and priests.
344.98	As you can imagine,
346.46	bringing these communities together
348.18	when prejudices are reinforced
348.18	by a global pandemic of fear
351.42	is not easy.
352.7	It was complicated.
355.38	We were confronted
355.38	with the hierarchy of decision-making
358.06	within religious establishments.
360.34	For example, with Catholic churches,
362.86	we were told that the archbishop
362.86	would have to make the decision.
366.18	And so we wrote a letter
366.18	to the archbishop.
368.3	We wrote a letter to the Vatican.
370.66	We're still waiting to hear back.
372.26	(Laughter)
374.14	And with other houses of worship,
376.22	we were told that the patrons,
376.22	the people that pay for the building
379.42	and the construction
379.42	and the painting of the buildings
381.98	would have to make a decision.
384.82	And then we came head-to-head
386.3	with the long legacy
386.3	of missionary and donor dependence
389.02	that so impedes
389.02	unconditional civic action,
392.34	and we learned this the hard way.
394.26	There was one community
395.86	that in our repeated conversations
395.86	would keep asking us
399.22	to appreciate them.
401.58	And so we would keep going back
403.62	and telling them that we appreciate them,
405.82	and of course,
407.66	if we didn't appreciate them,
407.66	we wouldn't be here.
412.9	And then we learned
412.9	painfully late in the game
415.42	"that the word ""appreciation"""
415.42	is code for getting paid to participate.
421.3	And so we challenged them
424.42	and we asked the question,
426.26	"""So what will it cost?"
428.46	How much could we pay you?
431.58	And if we pay for your faith,
431.58	"is it really faith?"""
435.66	We started the project
435.66	asking the question,
438.3	"""Where does your faith live?"""
440.5	And here we found ourselves
440.5	asking the question,
442.78	"""How much does your faith cost?"""
446.1	But the most difficult issue
446.1	was the perceived risk of standing apart.
450.5	We had one synagogue
450.5	that flat-out refused to participate
454.42	because it feared
454.42	drawing attention to itself
456.66	and becoming a target.
458.82	Similarly, we had a mosque
458.82	that also feared becoming a target.
463.42	And these fears are justified.
467.3	And yet, there were 25 houses of worship
467.3	that pledged to participate.
473.18	(Applause)
478.58	These bold leaders took the gesture
478.58	and reinforced it with their own meaning.
483.1	For some, it was to tell the world
483.1	that they're not terrorists.
486.74	For others, it was to welcome people
486.74	through their doors to ask questions.
491.46	And for some, it was to bridge the gap
493.34	between the older
493.34	and the younger generation,
495.5	which by the way is something that
495.5	many faiths are grappling with right now.
500.02	And for some it was simply
500.02	to build neighborhood solidarity
503.86	in advance of feared election violence.
507.7	When asked why yellow,
509.26	one imam beautifully said,
511.54	"""Yellow is the color of the sun."
514.22	The sun shines on us all equally.
516.78	"It does not discriminate."""
519.3	He and others spread the word
519.3	through their congregations
522.02	and over the radio.
523.26	Municipal government officials
523.26	stepped forward and helped
525.979	with permits and with convening
525.979	civil society organizations.
530.18	A paint company donated
530.18	a thousand liters of yellow paint
533.82	mixed especially for us
533.82	"in what they now call ""optimistic yellow."""
537.46	(Laughter)
538.78	(Applause)
543.86	And a poetry collective
543.86	joined forces with a university
547.14	and hosted a series of tweet chats
549.42	that challenged the nation
549.42	on issues of faith,
551.62	our faith not just
551.62	in the context of religion,
554.3	but our faith in politicians
554.3	and tribe and nation,
558.02	our faith in the older generation
558.02	and in the younger generation.
563.18	And then Colour in Faith
563.18	was launched at a gallery event
567.06	that invited an incredible mix
567.06	of gallerygoers
570.58	and religious leaders
570.58	and artists and businesspeople.
575.38	Already, even before
575.38	picking up a paintbrush,
578.06	we had accomplished so much
578.06	of the conversation and connection
582.3	that we had hoped for.
584.82	And then we began to paint.
589.74	Muslims stood by Christians
591.9	and atheists and agnostics and Hindus
595.14	and painted a mosque yellow.
601.86	And then they all came together again
601.86	and painted a church yellow,
606.94	and then another mosque,
609.06	and then another church.
611.66	Poets and musicians
611.66	performed while we painted.
614.98	We painted in Nairobi,
617.14	and then we painted in Mombasa.
620.66	The local and international press
620.66	did features on Colour in Faith
624.54	in English and French and Swahili
627.58	and Spanish and Somali.
630.22	CNN highlighted Colour in Faith
630.22	as a way of bringing communities together.
637.34	And our social media platforms lit up,
640.22	connecting more and more people.
642.78	And these neighbors
642.78	continued to stay in touch.
646.66	There are some that are pursuing
646.66	politics with a platform of peace,
650.3	and we have communities
650.3	as far as Argentina and the US
653.38	and as close as Mali and Rwanda
655.66	that are asking for our help.
657.5	And we would love to help.
659.78	It's our dream that this project,
659.78	this idea, spreads across the world,
663.98	with or without our support.
667.3	Colour in Faith is literally highlighting
667.3	those who mean well in yellow.
672.82	Colour in Faith is binding
672.82	neighborhoods together,
675.38	and it's our hope
675.38	that when threats come knocking,
677.9	they will collectively
677.9	sift fact from rumor
680.3	and stand in solidarity.
683.14	We've proven that the human family
683.14	can come together and send a message
686.82	far brighter and more powerful
689.22	than the voices of those
689.22	that wish to do us harm.
693.14	Though fear is infectious,
694.86	we are showing that so is hope.
698.66	Thank you.
699.94	(Applause)
