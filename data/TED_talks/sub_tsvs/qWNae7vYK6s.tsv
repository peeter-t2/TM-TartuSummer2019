13.07	"""All I wanted was"
13.07	a much-deserved promotion,
16.752	and he told me to 'Get up on the desk
18.585	"and spread 'em.'"""
21.904	"""All the men in my office"
21.904	wrote down on a piece of paper
24.675	the sexual favors
24.675	that I could do for them.
27.583	All I had asked for
27.583	"was an office with a window."""
32.19	"""I asked for his advice about how"
32.19	I could get a bill out of committee;
36.5	"he asked me if I brought my kneepads."""
41.753	Those are just a few
41.753	of the horrific stories
44.015	that I heard from women
44.015	over the last year,
46.547	as I've been investigating
46.547	workplace sexual harassment.
50.236	And what I found out
52.409	is that it's an epidemic across the world.
56.307	It's a horrifying reality
56.307	for millions of women,
59.646	when all they want to do every day
61.784	is go to work.
64.998	Sexual harassment doesn't discriminate.
67.886	You can wear a skirt,
69.799	hospital scrubs,
71.395	army fatigues.
73.456	You can be young or old,
75	married or single,
76.239	black or white.
77.453	You can be a Republican,
77.453	a Democrat or an Independent.
82.577	I heard from so many women:
86.047	police officers,
87.427	members of our military,
88.958	financial assistants,
90.439	actors, engineers, lawyers,
93.676	bankers, accountants, teachers ...
97.485	journalists.
101.521	Sexual harassment, it turns out,
103.746	is not about sex.
106.609	It's about power,
108.969	and about what somebody does to you
111.564	to try and take away your power.
114.862	And I'm here today
117.285	to encourage you to know
117.285	that you can take that power back.
123.21	(Applause)
127.675	On July 6, 2016,
131.004	I jumped off a cliff all by myself.
134.685	It was the scariest moment of my life;
136.969	an excruciating choice to make.
141.015	I fell into an abyss all alone,
144.688	not knowing what would be below.
148.373	But then, something miraculous
148.373	started to happen.
151.822	Thousands of women
151.822	started reaching out to me
154.046	to share their own stories
154.046	of pain and agony and shame.
158.132	They told me that I became their voice --
160.411	they were voiceless.
164.293	And suddenly, I realized
164.293	that even in the 21st century,
167.607	every woman still has a story.
172.796	Like Joyce,
175.125	a flight attendant supervisor
176.671	whose boss, in meetings every day,
178.602	would tell her about the porn
178.602	that he'd watched the night before
181.763	while drawing penises on his notepad.
183.664	She went to complain.
184.864	"She was called ""crazy"" and fired."
187.219	Like Joanne, Wall Street banker.
189.659	Her male colleagues would call her
189.659	that vile c-word every day.
193.258	She complained --
194.443	labeled a troublemaker,
195.808	never to do another
195.808	Wall Street deal again.
199.438	Like Elizabeth, an army officer.
202.831	Her male subordinates would wave
202.831	one-dollar bills in her face,
206.335	"and say, ""Dance for me!"""
208.456	And when she went to complain to a major,
210.439	"he said, ""What? Only one dollar?"
213.007	"You're worth at least five or ten!"""
218.392	After reading,
219.989	replying to all
222.277	and crying over all of these emails,
226.802	I realized I had so much work to do.
232.385	Here are the startling facts:
234.077	one in three women -- that we know of --
236.926	have been sexually harassed
236.926	in the workplace.
240.636	Seventy-one percent of those incidences
240.636	never get reported.
246.874	Why?
248.738	Because when women come forward,
250.459	they're still called liars
250.459	and troublemakers
252.614	and demeaned and trashed
254.594	and demoted and blacklisted
256.395	and fired.
257.79	Reporting sexual harassment can be,
257.79	in many cases, career-ending.
263.136	Of all the women that reached out to me,
266.001	almost none are still today working
266.001	in their chosen profession,
270.898	and that is outrageous.
276.036	I, too, was silent in the beginning.
280.256	It happened to me at the end
280.256	of my year as Miss America,
284.391	when I was meeting with
284.391	a very high-ranking TV executive
287.077	in New York City.
288.265	I thought he was helping me
288.265	throughout the day,
290.517	making a lot of phone calls.
291.876	We went to dinner,
293.062	and in the back seat of a car,
293.062	he suddenly lunged on top of me
296.009	and stuck his tongue down my throat.
299.928	"I didn't realize that to ""get"
299.928	"into the business"" -- silly me --"
305.608	he also intended to get into my pants.
310.685	And just a week later,
311.954	when I was in Los Angeles
311.954	meeting with a high-ranking publicist,
316.556	it happened again.
318.099	Again, in a car.
319.439	And he took my neck in his hand,
322.434	and he shoved my head
322.434	so hard into his crotch,
325.52	I couldn't breathe.
333.137	These are the events that suck the life
333.137	out of all of your self-confidence.
341.709	These are the events that, until recently,
345.89	I didn't even call assault.
351.455	And this is why we have
351.455	so much work to do.
359.431	After my year as Miss America,
361.424	I continued to meet
361.424	a lot of well-known people,
364.899	including Donald Trump.
368.05	When this picture was taken in 1988,
370.372	nobody could have ever predicted
370.372	where we'd be today.
372.96	(Laughter)
375.239	Me, fighting to end sexual
375.239	harassment in the workplace;
379.357	he, president of the United States
381.817	in spite of it.
386.266	And shortly thereafter, I got
386.266	my first gig in television news
389.321	in Richmond, Virginia.
390.498	Check out that confident smile
390.498	with the bright pink jacket.
393.303	Not so much the hair.
394.554	(Laughter)
396.458	I was working so hard to prove
396.458	that blondes have a lot of brains.
403.027	But ironically, one of the first
403.027	stories I covered
405.684	was the Anita Hill hearings
405.684	in Washington, DC.
408.663	And shortly thereafter,
410.251	I, too, was sexually harassed
410.251	in the workplace.
414.043	I was covering a story in rural Virginia,
416.512	and when we got back into the car,
418.206	my cameraman started saying to me,
420.109	wondering how much I had enjoyed
420.109	when he touched my breasts
423.004	when he put the microphone on me.
424.601	And it went downhill from there.
426.947	I was bracing myself
426.947	against the passenger door --
429.315	this was before cellphones.
430.872	I was petrified.
432.142	I actually envisioned myself
432.142	rolling outside of that door
436.228	as the car was going 50 miles per hour
436.228	like I'd seen in the movies,
439.481	and wondering how much it would hurt.
445.88	When the story about
445.88	Harvey Weinstein came to light --
448.886	one the most well-known
448.886	movie moguls in all of Hollywood --
452.329	the allegations were horrific.
454.882	But so many women came forward,
456.873	and it made me realize
456.873	what I had done meant something.
461.381	(Applause)
468.245	He had such a lame excuse.
470.813	He said he was a product
470.813	of the '60s and '70s,
473.218	and that that was the culture then.
474.998	Yeah, that was the culture then,
476.901	and unfortunately, it still is.
479.822	Why?
481.779	Because of all the myths
483.174	that are still associated
483.174	with sexual harassment.
487.004	"""Women should just take another job"
487.004	"and find another career."""
490.263	Yeah, right.
491.441	Tell that to the single mom
491.441	working two jobs,
493.632	trying to make ends meet,
495.075	who's also being sexually harassed.
498.082	"""Women --"
499.651	"they bring it on themselves."""
502.005	By the clothes that we wear
503.595	and the makeup that we put on.
505.876	Yeah, I guess those hoodies
505.876	that Uber engineers wear in Silicon Valley
509.455	are just so provocative.
512.639	"""Women make it up."""
514.619	Yeah, because it's so fun and rewarding
517.573	to be demeaned and taken down.
520.182	I would know.
523.324	"""Women bring these claims"
523.324	"because they want to be famous and rich."""
528.456	Our own president said that.
532.465	I bet Taylor Swift,
534.31	one of the most well-known
534.31	and richest singers in the world,
538.66	didn't need more money or fame
540.352	when she came forward
540.352	with her groping case
542.581	for one dollar.
544.688	And I'm so glad she did.
549.018	Breaking news:
550.75	the untold story about women
550.75	and sexual harassment in the workplace:
556.667	women just want a safe, welcoming
559.522	and harass-free environment.
562.056	That's it.
564.18	(Applause)
570.405	So how do we go about
570.405	getting our power back?
573.5	I have three solutions.
575.667	Number one:
577.219	we need to turn bystanders
577.219	and enablers into allies.
581.88	Ninety-eight percent of United States
581.88	corporations right now
584.942	have sexual harassment training policies.
587.089	Seventy percent have prevention programs.
590.9	But still, overwhelmingly,
593.103	bystanders and witnesses
593.103	don't come forward.
597.225	In 2016,
598.401	the Harvard Business Review
598.401	"called it the ""bystander effect."""
603.76	And yet -- remember 9/11.
607.227	Millions of times we've heard,
609.804	"""If you see something,"
611.232	"say something."""
613.845	Imagine how impactful that would be
613.845	if we carried that through
617.715	to bystanders in the workplace
617.715	regarding sexual harassment --
621.933	to recognize and interrupt
621.933	these incidences;
626.397	to confront the perpetrators
626.397	to their face;
630.7	to help and protect the victims.
634.279	This is my shout-out to men:
636.715	we need you in this fight.
639.56	And to women, too --
641.209	enablers to allies.
644.499	Number two:
645.879	change the laws.
649.029	How many of you out there know
650.491	whether or not you have
650.491	a forced arbitration clause
652.934	in your employment contract?
656.095	Not a lot of hands.
657.269	And if you don't know, you should,
659.021	and here's why.
661.096	TIME Magazine calls it,
662.376	right there on the screen,
664.039	"""The teeny tiny little print in contracts"
667.418	that keeps sexual
667.418	"harassment claims unheard."""
671.646	Here's what it is.
673.039	Forced arbitration takes away
673.039	your Seventh Amendment right
675.857	to an open jury process.
677.85	It's secret.
680.105	You don't get the same
680.105	witnesses or depositions.
682.424	In many cases, the company
682.424	picks the arbitrator for you.
685.855	There are no appeals,
688.355	and only 20 percent of the time
688.355	does the employee win.
691.927	But again, it's secret,
693.583	so nobody ever knows what happened to you.
697.732	This is why I've been
697.732	working so diligently
699.772	on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC
701.428	to change the laws.
702.604	And here's what I tell the Senators:
704.444	sexual harassment is apolitical.
706.464	Before somebody harasses you,
708.067	they don't ask you if you're
708.067	a Republican or Democrat first.
711.825	They just do it.
713.143	And this is why we should all care.
716.385	Number three:
717.94	be fierce.
719.666	It starts when we stand tall,
722.293	and we build that self-confidence.
724.279	And we stand up and we speak up,
726.101	and we tell the world what happened to us.
729.932	I know it's scary,
731.957	but let's do it for our kids.
734.102	Let's stop this for the next generations.
738.777	I know that I did it for my children.
742.835	They were paramount in my decision-making
745.069	about whether or not I would come forward.
747.623	My beautiful children,
748.941	my 12-year-old son, Christian,
750.728	my 14-year-old daughter, Kaia.
752.918	And boy, did I underestimate them.
756.164	The first day of school last year
757.764	happened to be the day
757.764	my resolution was announced,
760.201	and I was so anxious
760.201	about what they would face.
762.486	My daughter came home
762.486	from school and she said,
764.723	"""Mommy, so many people asked me"
764.723	"what happened to you over the summer."""
768.125	Then she looked at me in the eyes
769.77	"and she said, ""And mommy,"
771.291	I was so proud
773.794	"to say that you were my mom."""
778.749	And two weeks later,
780.033	when she finally found the courage
780.033	to stand up to two kids
784.011	who had been making her life miserable,
786.083	she came home to me and she said,
787.722	"""Mommy, I found the courage to do it"
791.917	"because I saw you do it."""
796.51	(Applause)
804.487	You see, giving the gift
804.487	of courage is contagious.
810.394	And I hope that my journey
810.394	has inspired you,
813.757	because right now, it's the tipping point.
816.922	We are watching history happen.
819.258	More and more women
819.258	are coming forward and saying,
821.686	"""Enough is enough."""
826.036	(Applause)
831.412	Here's my one last plea to companies.
834.558	Let's hire back all those women
834.558	whose careers were lost
839.027	because of some random jerk.
842.117	Because here's what I know about women:
845.116	we will not longer be underestimated,
845.116	intimidated or set back;
849.881	we will not be silenced
849.881	by the ways of the establishment
853.257	or the relics of the past.
855.209	No.
856.819	We will stand up and speak up
860.214	and have our voices heard.
862.778	We will be the women we were meant to be.
867.957	And above all,
869.938	we will always be fierce.
874.196	Thank you.
875.701	(Applause)
