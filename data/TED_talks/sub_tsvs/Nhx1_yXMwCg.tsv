12.397	When we talk about corruption,
14.852	there are typical types
14.852	of individuals that spring to mind.
18.322	There's the former Soviet megalomaniacs.
20.65	Saparmurat Niyazov, he was one of them.
23.839	Until his death in 2006,
25.827	he was the all-powerful
25.827	leader of Turkmenistan,
29.133	a Central Asian country
29.133	rich in natural gas.
32.898	Now, he really loved to issue
32.898	presidential decrees.
36.848	And one renamed the months of the year
39.093	including after himself and his mother.
42.243	He spent millions of dollars
44.277	creating a bizarre personality cult,
47.097	and his crowning glory was the building
49.066	of a 40-foot-high gold-plated
49.066	statue of himself
53.106	which stood proudly
53.106	in the capital's central square
56.17	and rotated to follow the sun.
59.162	He was a slightly unusual guy.
61.935	And then there's that cliché,
63.792	the African dictator
63.792	or minister or official.
67.191	There's Teodorín Obiang.
70.302	So his daddy is president
70.302	for life of Equatorial Guinea,
74.533	a West African nation that has exported
77.657	billions of dollars of oil since the 1990s
81.138	and yet has a truly appalling
81.138	human rights record.
85.182	The vast majority of its people
87.076	are living in really miserable poverty
90.031	despite an income
90.031	per capita that's on a par
92.151	with that of Portugal.
94.649	So Obiang junior, well, he buys himself
97.354	a $30 million mansion
97.354	in Malibu, California.
101.786	I've been up to its front gates.
102.887	I can tell you it's a magnificent spread.
105.982	He bought an €18 million art collection
109.701	that used to belong to fashion
109.701	designer Yves Saint Laurent,
113.84	a stack of fabulous sports cars,
115.388	some costing a million dollars apiece --
117.943	oh, and a Gulfstream jet, too.
120.259	Now get this:
121.62	Until recently, he was earning
121.62	an official monthly salary
125.761	of less than 7,000 dollars.
129.915	And there's Dan Etete.
131.968	Well, he was the former
131.968	oil minister of Nigeria
134.612	under President Abacha,
136.586	and it just so happens
136.586	he's a convicted money launderer too.
140.088	We've spent a great deal of time
142.33	investigating a $1 billion --
144.731	that's right, a $1 billion —
146.494	oil deal that he was involved with,
149.155	and what we found was pretty shocking,
151.107	but more about that later.
153.873	So it's easy to think
153.873	that corruption happens
157.39	somewhere over there,
159.25	carried out by a bunch of greedy despots
161.706	and individuals up to no good in countries
163.73	that we, personally, may
163.73	know very little about
166.738	and feel really unconnected to
168.427	and unaffected by what might be going on.
171.915	But does it just happen over there?
175.158	Well, at 22, I was very lucky.
178.437	My first job out of university
181.218	was investigating the illegal
181.218	trade in African ivory.
185.202	And that's how my relationship
185.202	with corruption really began.
189.431	In 1993, with two friends
189.431	who were colleagues,
192.439	Simon Taylor and Patrick Alley,
195.242	we set up an organization
195.242	called Global Witness.
198.843	Our first campaign
198.843	was investigating the role
201.593	of illegal logging in funding
201.593	the war in Cambodia.
205.899	So a few years later, and it's now 1997,
208.942	and I'm in Angola undercover
208.942	investigating blood diamonds.
213.703	Perhaps you saw the film,
215.43	"the Hollywood film ""Blood Diamond,"""
217.121	the one with Leonardo DiCaprio.
218.698	Well, some of that sprang from our work.
222.153	Luanda, it was full of land mine victims
224.869	who were struggling
224.869	to survive on the streets
227.049	and war orphans living
227.049	in sewers under the streets,
230.137	and a tiny, very wealthy elite
232.226	who gossiped about shopping
232.226	trips to Brazil and Portugal.
235.445	And it was a slightly crazy place.
238.206	So I'm sitting in a hot
238.206	and very stuffy hotel room
241.89	feeling just totally overwhelmed.
244.95	But it wasn't about blood diamonds.
247.306	Because I'd been speaking
247.306	to lots of people there
250.208	who, well, they talked
250.208	about a different problem:
252.576	that of a massive web
252.576	of corruption on a global scale
255.997	and millions of oil dollars going missing.
259.331	And for what was then
259.331	a very small organization
261.792	of just a few people,
263.94	trying to even begin to think
263.94	how we might tackle that
266.682	was an enormous challenge.
269.153	And in the years that I've been,
270.701	and we've all been campaigning
270.701	and investigating,
273.255	I've repeatedly seen
273.255	that what makes corruption
275.519	on a global, massive scale possible,
277.787	well it isn't just greed
277.787	or the misuse of power
280.921	"or that nebulous phrase ""weak governance."""
283.36	I mean, yes, it's all of those,
285.397	but corruption, it's made
285.397	possible by the actions
288.349	of global facilitators.
291.97	So let's go back to some of those
291.97	people I talked about earlier.
295.16	Now, they're all people
295.16	we've investigated,
296.677	and they're all people who couldn't
296.677	do what they do alone.
299.463	Take Obiang junior. Well, he didn't end up
301.903	with high-end art and luxury
301.903	houses without help.
305.742	He did business with global banks.
307.917	A bank in Paris held accounts
307.917	of companies controlled by him,
311.756	one of which was used to buy the art,
314.154	and American banks, well, they funneled
319.731	some of which was used to buy
319.731	that California mansion.
323.83	And he didn't do all of this
323.83	in his own name either.
326.738	He used shell companies.
328.492	He used one to buy
328.492	the property, and another,
330.826	which was in somebody else's name,
332.912	to pay the huge bills it
332.912	cost to run the place.
336.91	And then there's Dan Etete.
339.138	Well, when he was oil minister,
341.22	he awarded an oil block now
341.22	worth over a billion dollars
346.35	to a company that, guess what, yeah,
349.184	he was the hidden owner of.
351.567	Now, it was then much later traded on
354.969	with the kind assistance
354.969	of the Nigerian government --
357.565	now I have to be careful what I say here —
359.647	to subsidiaries of Shell
359.647	and the Italian Eni,
363.796	two of the biggest oil companies around.
366.45	So the reality is,
366.45	is that the engine of corruption,
368.903	well, it exists far
368.903	beyond the shores of countries
371.346	like Equatorial Guinea
371.346	or Nigeria or Turkmenistan.
374.545	This engine, well, it's driven
376.869	by our international banking system,
379.235	by the problem of anonymous
379.235	shell companies,
381.778	and by the secrecy that we have afforded
384.16	big oil, gas and mining operations,
387.129	and, most of all, by the failure
387.129	of our politicians
390.862	to back up their rhetoric and do something
392.937	really meaningful and systemic
392.937	to tackle this stuff.
397.929	Now let's take the banks first.
399.94	Well, it's not going
399.94	to come as any surprise
402.274	for me to tell you that banks
402.274	accept dirty money,
406.586	but they prioritize their profits
406.586	in other destructive ways too.
411.13	For example, in Sarawak, Malaysia.
414.237	Now this region, it has just five percent
417.876	of its forests left intact. Five percent.
423.292	So how did that happen?
424.627	Well, because an elite
424.627	and its facilitators
427.683	have been making millions of dollars
429.857	from supporting logging
429.857	on an industrial scale
433.388	for many years.
435.794	So we sent an undercover investigator in
438.048	to secretly film meetings
438.048	with members of the ruling elite,
441.638	and the resulting footage, well,
441.638	it made some people very angry,
444.969	and you can see that on YouTube,
447.219	but it proved what we had long suspected,
449.196	because it showed
449.196	how the state's chief minister,
452.693	despite his later denials,
454.603	used his control over land
454.603	and forest licenses
458.002	to enrich himself and his family.
461.033	And HSBC, well, we know
461.033	that HSBC bankrolled
465.632	the region's largest logging companies
467.641	that were responsible
467.641	for some of that destruction
470.046	in Sarawak and elsewhere.
472.633	The bank violated its own
472.633	sustainability policies in the process,
476.341	but it earned around 130 million dollars.
480.161	Now shortly after our exposé,
482.497	very shortly after our exposé
482.497	earlier this year,
485.099	the bank announced
485.099	a policy review on this.
488.103	And is this progress? Maybe,
490.689	but we're going to be
490.689	keeping a very close eye
493.192	on that case.
495.529	And then there's the problem
495.529	of anonymous shell companies.
498.942	Well, we've all heard
498.942	about what they are, I think,
501.771	and we all know they're used quite a bit
504.267	by people and companies
504.267	who are trying to avoid
506.853	paying their proper dues to society,
509.9	also known as taxes.
511.953	But what doesn't usually come to light
514.862	is how shell companies are used to steal
519.412	huge sums of money,
519.412	transformational sums of money,
522.784	from poor countries.
524.83	In virtually every case of corruption
524.83	that we've investigated,
528.25	shell companies have appeared,
530.462	and sometimes
530.462	it's been impossible to find out
532.822	who is really involved in the deal.
536.334	A recent study by the World Bank
538.662	looked at 200 cases of corruption.
541.612	It found that over 70
541.612	percent of those cases
544.702	had used anonymous shell companies,
547.656	totaling almost 56 billion dollars.
551.038	Now many of these
551.038	companies were in America
553.3	or the United Kingdom,
554.61	its overseas territories
554.61	and Crown dependencies,
557.011	and so it's not just an offshore problem,
559.265	it's an on-shore one too.
561.557	You see, shell companies, they're central
563.696	to the secret deals which may
563.696	benefit wealthy elites
566.95	rather than ordinary citizens.
569.974	One striking recent case
569.974	that we've investigated
573.22	is how the government
573.22	in the Democratic Republic of Congo
576.196	sold off a series of valuable,
576.196	state-owned mining assets
580.553	to shell companies
580.553	in the British Virgin Islands.
583.907	So we spoke to sources in country,
586.179	trawled through company
586.179	documents and other information
589.215	trying to piece together a really
589.215	true picture of the deal.
593.27	And we were alarmed to find
593.27	that these shell companies
596.095	had quickly flipped many of the assets on
598.611	for huge profits to major
598.611	international mining companies
602.832	listed in London.
605.195	Now, the Africa Progress
605.195	Panel, led by Kofi Annan,
608.451	they've calculated
608.451	that Congo may have lost
611.339	more than 1.3 billion dollars
611.339	from these deals.
616.443	That's almost twice
618.696	the country's annual health
618.696	and education budget combined.
624.336	And will the people of Congo,
624.336	will they ever get their money back?
626.962	Well, the answer to that question,
628.62	and who was really involved
628.62	and what really happened,
630.514	well that's going to probably
630.514	remain locked away
633.017	in the secretive company registries
633.017	of the British Virgin Islands
636.166	and elsewhere unless we all do
636.166	something about it.
641	And how about the oil, gas
641	and mining companies?
643.987	Okay, maybe it's a bit
643.987	of a cliché to talk about them.
646.701	Corruption in that sector, no surprise.
648.821	There's corruption everywhere,
648.821	so why focus on that sector?
653.254	Well, because there's a lot at stake.
655.454	In 2011, natural resource exports
659.551	outweighed aid flows by almost 19 to one
663.063	in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
663.063	Nineteen to one.
667.486	Now that's a hell of a lot
667.486	of schools and universities
671.123	and hospitals and business startups,
673.1	many of which haven't
673.1	materialized and never will
675.458	because some of that money
675.458	has simply been stolen away.
679.789	Now let's go back to the oil
679.789	and mining companies,
682.194	and let's go back to Dan Etete
682.194	and that $1 billion deal.
685.21	And now forgive me, I'm
685.21	going to read the next bit
688.499	because it's a very live
688.499	issue, and our lawyers
690.796	have been through this in some detail
692.986	and they want me to get it right.
696.296	Now, on the surface, the deal
696.296	appeared straightforward.
700.469	Subsidiaries of Shell and Eni
702.569	paid the Nigerian
702.569	government for the block.
705.543	The Nigerian government transferred
707.706	precisely the same amount,
707.706	to the very dollar,
710.53	to an account earmarked
710.53	for a shell company
715.145	whose hidden owner was Etete.
717.271	Now, that's not bad going
717.271	for a convicted money launderer.
720.66	And here's the thing.
722.117	After many months of digging around
723.994	and reading through hundreds
723.994	of pages of court documents,
727.529	we found evidence that, in fact,
729.484	Shell and Eni had known that the funds
732.913	would be transferred
732.913	to that shell company,
735.988	and frankly, it's hard
735.988	to believe they didn't know
739.695	who they were really dealing with there.
742.986	Now, it just shouldn't take
742.986	these sorts of efforts
746.074	to find out where the money
746.074	in deals like this went.
748.603	I mean, these are state assets.
750.172	They're supposed to be
750.172	used for the benefit
751.638	of the people in the country.
753.371	But in some countries,
753.371	citizens and journalists
756.56	who are trying to expose stories like this
758.584	have been harassed and arrested
760.085	and some have even risked
760.085	their lives to do so.
764.54	And finally, well, there
764.54	are those who believe
768.344	that corruption is unavoidable.
770.668	It's just how some business is done.
772.817	It's too complex and difficult to change.
775.382	So in effect, what? We just accept it.
778.309	But as a campaigner and investigator,
780.702	I have a different view,
781.753	because I've seen what can happen
783.923	when an idea gains momentum.
786.477	In the oil and mining sector, for example,
789.221	there is now the beginning
790.484	of a truly worldwide transparency standard
793.733	that could tackle some of these problems.
796.753	In 1999, when Global Witness called
799.175	for oil companies to make
799.175	payments on deals transparent,
802.514	well, some people laughed
802.514	at the extreme naiveté
806.303	of that small idea.
808.406	But literally hundreds
808.406	of civil society groups
811.976	from around the world came together
813.854	to fight for transparency,
815.463	and now it's fast becoming
815.463	the norm and the law.
819.444	Two thirds of the value
821.416	of the world's oil and mining companies
823.736	are now covered by transparency laws.
823.736	Two thirds.
827.507	So this is change happening.
828.98	This is progress.
830.87	But we're not there yet, by far.
833.993	Because it really isn't about corruption
836.239	somewhere over there, is it?
838.354	In a globalized world, corruption
840.559	is a truly globalized business,
842.822	and one that needs global solutions,
844.937	supported and pushed by us
844.937	all, as global citizens,
848.937	right here.
850.099	Thank you.
851.289	(Applause)
