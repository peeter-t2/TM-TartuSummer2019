12.968	I visit the future for a living.
16.265	Not just one future,
17.915	but many possible futures,
20.185	bringing back evidences from those futures
20.185	for you to experience today.
25.197	Like an archaeologist of the future.
28.432	Over the years, my many journeys
28.432	have brought back things
31.188	like a new species
31.188	of synthetically engineered bees;
37.052	"a book named, ""Pets as Protein;"""
40.263	a machine that makes you rich
40.263	by trading your genetic data;
43.451	a lamp powered by sugar;
46.045	a computer for growing food.
48.573	OK, so I don't actually travel
48.573	to different futures -- yet.
52.988	But my husband Jon and I spend
52.988	a lot of time thinking
55.951	and creating visions
55.951	of different futures in our studio.
60.081	We are constantly looking out
60.081	for weak signals,
62.881	those murmurs of future potential.
65.279	Then we trace those threads of potential
65.279	out into the future, asking:
69.963	What might it feel like
69.963	to live in this future?
73.068	What might we see, hear and even breathe?
77.157	Then we run experiments,
77.157	build prototypes, make objects,
81.63	bringing aspects of these futures to life,
83.684	making them concrete and tangible
86.02	so you can really feel the impact
86.02	of those future possibilities
90.798	here and now.
92.936	But this work is not about predictions.
95.761	It's about creating tools --
97.792	tools that can help connect
97.792	our present and our future selves
101.28	so we become active participants
101.28	in creating a future we want --
105.709	a future that works for all.
108.758	So how do we go about doing this?
111.143	For a recent project called Drone Aviary,
114.511	we were interested in exploring
116.073	what it would mean to live
116.073	with drones in our cities.
119.064	Drones that have the power
119.064	to see things we can't,
121.921	to go places we can't
123.697	and to do so with increasing autonomy.
126.734	But to understand the technology,
128.348	getting our hands dirty was crucial.
130.652	So we built several different
130.652	drones in our studio.
133.506	We gave them names, functions
133.506	and then flew them --
137.395	but not without difficulty.
139.413	Things came loose,
140.826	GPS signals glitched
142.47	and drones crashed.
144.599	But it was through such experimentation
146.765	that we could construct a very
146.765	concrete and very experiential slice
150.964	of one possible future.
153.613	So now, let's go to that future.
156.199	Let's imagine we are living in a city
156.199	with drones like this one.
160.196	We call it The Nightwatchman.
162.756	It patrols the streets, often spotted
162.756	in the evenings and at night.
167.239	Initially, many of us were annoyed
167.239	by its low, dull hum.
171.144	But then, like everything else,
171.144	we got used to it.
174.423	Now, what if you could see
174.423	the world through its eyes?
178.615	See how it constantly logs
178.615	every resident of our neighborhood;
182.961	logging the kids who play football
182.961	in the no-ballgame area
186.305	and marking them as statutory nuisances.
188.776	(Laughter)
190.237	And then see how it disperses
190.237	this other group, who are teenagers,
194.231	with the threat of an autonomously
194.231	issued injunction.
198.387	And then there's this giant
198.387	floating disc called Madison.
202.203	Its glaring presence is so overpowering,
204.447	I can't help but stare at it.
207.242	But if feels like each time I look at it,
209.267	it knows a little more about me --
211.914	like it keeps flashing all these
211.914	Brianair adverts at me,
215.103	as if it knows about
215.103	the holiday I'm planning.
218.479	I'm not sure if I find this
218.479	mildly entertaining
222.23	or just entirely invasive.
225.684	Back to the present.
227.611	In creating this future, we learned a lot.
230.352	Not just about how these machines work,
232.982	but what it would feel like
232.982	to live alongside them.
236.239	Whilst drones like Madison
236.239	and Nightwatchman,
238.517	in these particular forms,
240.058	are not real yet,
241.623	most elements of a drone future
241.623	are in fact very real today.
246.264	For instance,
247.439	facial recognition systems
247.439	are everywhere --
249.777	in our phones, even in our thermostats
252.211	and in cameras around our cities --
254.714	keeping a record of everything we do,
257.484	whether it's an advertisement
257.484	we glanced at or a protest we attended.
261.693	These things are here,
263.387	and we often don't understand
263.387	how they work,
266.135	and what their consequences could be.
269.279	And we see this all around us.
270.883	This difficulty in even imagining
272.679	how the consequences of our actions
272.679	today will affect our future.
277.649	Last year, where I live, in the UK,
277.649	there was a referendum
280.558	where the people could vote
280.558	for the UK to leave the EU
283.107	or stay in the EU,
284.289	"popularly known as ""Brexit."""
286.819	And soon after the results came out,
288.645	a word began to surface
288.645	"called ""Bregret"" --"
291.684	(Laughter)
292.748	describing people who chose to vote
292.748	for Brexit as a protest,
296.207	but without thinking through
296.207	its potential consequences.
301.127	And this disconnect is evident
301.127	in some of the simplest things.
305.795	Say you go out for a quick drink.
307.688	Then you decide
307.688	you wouldn't mind a few more.
310.446	You know you'll wake up
310.446	in the morning feeling awful,
313.09	but you justify it by saying,
314.496	"""The other me in the future"
314.496	"will deal with that."""
317.607	But as we find out in the morning,
319.499	"that future ""you"" is you."
322.454	When I was growing up in India
322.454	in the late '70s and early '80s,
325.675	there was a feeling
326.85	that the future both needed to
326.85	and could actually be planned.
330.343	I remember my parents had to plan
330.343	for some of the simplest things.
333.627	When they wanted a telephone in our house,
335.68	they needed to order it and then wait --
338.014	wait for nearly five years before
338.014	it got installed in our house.
341.285	(Laughter)
342.343	And then if they wanted to call
342.343	my grandparents who lived in another city,
345.865	they needed to book
345.865	"something called a ""trunk call,"""
348.417	and then wait again,
348.417	for hours or even days.
351.298	And then abruptly, the phone
351.298	would ring at two in the morning,
354.259	and all of us would jump out of our beds
354.259	and gather round the phone,
357.533	shrieking into it,
357.533	discussing general well-being
359.872	at two in the morning.
361.229	Today it can feel like things
361.229	are happening too fast --
365.033	so fast, that it can
365.033	become really difficult
367.312	for us to form an understanding
367.312	of our place in history.
370.293	It creates an overwhelming sense
370.293	of uncertainty and anxiety,
373.744	and so, we let the future
373.744	just happen to us.
378.032	"We don't connect with that future ""us."""
380.528	We treat our future selves as a stranger,
382.864	and the future as a foreign land.
385.735	It's not a foreign land;
386.944	it's unfolding right in front of us,
388.716	continually being shaped
388.716	by our actions today.
391.734	We are that future,
393.94	and so I believe fighting
393.94	for a future we want
396.794	is more urgent and necessary
396.794	than ever before.
400.297	We have learned in our work
401.786	that one of the most powerful means
401.786	of effecting change
405.254	is when people can directly, tangibly
405.254	and emotionally experience
409.422	some of the future consequences
409.422	of their actions today.
413.13	Earlier this year, the government
413.13	of the United Arab Emirates invited us
417.128	to help them shape
417.128	their country's energy strategy
419.598	all the way up to 2050.
421.558	Based on the government's econometric
421.558	data, we created this large city model,
425.84	and visualized many
425.84	possible futures on it.
430.387	As I was excitably taking a group
430.387	of government officials
433.731	and members of energy companies
435.292	through one sustainable
435.292	future on our model,
437.847	one of the participants told me,
440.122	"""I cannot imagine that in the future"
440.122	people will stop driving cars
443.253	"and start using public transport."""
445.916	And then he said,
447.1	"""There's no way I can tell my own son"
447.1	"to stop driving his car."""
451.927	But we were prepared for this reaction.
455.208	Working with scientists in a chemistry lab
455.208	in my home city in India,
458.569	we had created approximate samples
460.768	of what the air would be like in 2030
460.768	if our behavior stays the same.
466.493	And so, I walked the group
466.493	over to this object
469.91	that emits vapor from those air samples.
473.494	Just one whiff of the noxious
473.494	polluted air from 2030
477.074	brought home the point
477.074	that no amount of data can.
481.069	This is not the future you would want
481.069	your children to inherit.
484.62	The next day, the government
484.62	made a big announcement.
487.209	They would be investing billions
487.209	of dollars in renewables.
490.396	We don't know what part our future
490.396	experiences played in this decision,
494.799	but we know that they've changed
494.799	their energy policy
497.315	to mitigate such a scenario.
498.823	While something like air from the future
498.823	is very effective and tangible,
502.352	the trajectory from our present
502.352	to a future consequence
505.206	is not always so linear.
507.347	Even when a technology
507.347	is developed with utopian ideals,
510.544	the moment it leaves the laboratory
510.544	and enters the world,
513.301	it is subject to forces outside
513.301	of the creators' control.
517.617	For one particular project,
517.617	we investigated medical genomics:
521.875	the technology of gathering
521.875	and using people's genetic data
524.99	to create personalized medicine.
527.268	We were asking:
528.67	What are some of the unintended
528.67	consequences of linking our genetics
532.418	to health care?
535.175	To explore this question further,
537.465	we created a fictional lawsuit,
539.914	and brought it to life through 31 pieces
539.914	of carefully crafted evidence.
544.783	So we built an illegal genetic clinic,
547.895	a DIY carbon dioxide incubator,
551.102	and even bought frozen mice on eBay.
554.273	So now let's go to that future
554.273	where this lawsuit is unfolding,
557.452	and meet the defendant, Arnold Mann.
560.194	Arnold is being prosecuted
560.194	by this global giant biotech company
563.783	called Dynamic Genetics,
565.627	because they have evidence
567.141	that Arnold has illegally inserted
567.141	the company's patented genetic material
571.755	into his body.
573.273	How on earth did Arnold manage to do that?
576.853	Well, it all started
578.051	when Arnold was asked to submit
578.051	a saliva sample in this spit kit
582.258	to the NHI --
583.84	the UK's National Health
583.84	Insurance service.
587.289	When Arnold received
587.289	his health insurance bill,
590.233	he was shocked and scared
591.969	to see that his premiums
591.969	had gone through the roof,
594.375	beyond anything he or his family
594.375	could ever afford.
597.97	The state's algorithm had scanned
597.97	his genetic data
600.675	and found the risk of a chronic health
600.675	condition lurking in his DNA.
605.135	And so Arnold had to start paying
605.135	toward the potential costs
608.523	of that future disease --
610.223	potential future disease from today.
612.43	In that moment of fear and panic,
614.066	Arnold slipped through the city
615.596	into the dark shadows
615.596	of this illegal clinic for treatment --
619.457	a treatment that would modify his DNA
621.642	so that the state's algorithm
621.642	would no longer see him as a risk,
625.324	and his insurance premiums
625.324	would become affordable again.
628.325	But Arnold was caught.
630.034	And the legal proceedings in the case
630.034	Dynamic Genetics v. Mann began.
634.961	In bringing such a future to life,
636.677	what was important to us
636.677	was that people could actually touch,
639.655	see and feel its potential,
641.757	because such an immediate and close
641.757	encounter provokes people
644.776	to ask the right questions,
646.816	questions like:
648.111	What are the implications
648.111	of living in a world
650.321	where I'm judged on my genetics?
653.045	Or: Who might claim ownership
653.045	to my genetic data,
656.21	and what might they do with it?
658.918	If this feels even slightly
658.918	out-there or farfetched,
662.051	today there's a little-known bill
662.051	being passed through the American congress
665.867	known as HR 1313, Preserving
665.867	Employee Wellness Programs Act.
670.455	This bill proposes to amend the Genetic
670.455	Information Nondiscrimination Act,
674.959	popularly known as GINA,
676.689	and would allow employers to ask
676.689	about family medical history
680.021	and genetic data
681.229	to all employees for the first time.
684.938	Those who refuse
684.938	would face large penalties.
689.346	In the work I've shown so far,
691.124	whether it was drones or genetic crimes,
693.311	these stories describe troubling futures
695.693	with the intention of helping us
695.693	avoid those futures.
699.004	But what about what we can't avoid?
701.577	Today, especially with climate change,
703.693	it looks like we are heading for trouble.
706.151	And so what we want to do now
706.151	is to prepare for that future
709.374	by developing tools and attitudes
709.374	that can help us find hope --
714.322	hope that can inspire action.
716.908	Currently, we are running
716.908	an experiment in our studio.
719.62	It's a work in progress.
721.539	Based on climate data projections,
723.787	we are exploring a future
725.367	where the Western world has moved
725.367	from abundance to scarcity.
728.824	We imagine living in a future city
728.824	with repeated flooding,
732.259	periods with almost
732.259	no food in supermarkets,
735.02	economic instabilities,
736.78	broken supply chains.
739.111	What can we do to not just survive,
739.111	but prosper in such a world?
744.015	What food can we eat?
746.163	To really step inside these questions,
748.006	we are building this room in a flat
748.006	in London from 2050.
752.654	It's like a little time capsule
752.654	that we reclaimed from the future.
755.994	We stripped it down to the bare minimum.
758.164	Everything we lovingly put in our homes,
760.094	like flat-panel TVs,
761.794	internet-connected fridges
763.614	and artisanal furnishings
765.067	all had to go.
766.413	And in its place,
766.413	we're building food computers
769.339	from abandoned, salvaged
769.339	and repurposed materials,
772.715	turning today's waste
772.715	into tomorrow's dinner.
776.707	For instance,
777.882	we've just finished building our first
777.882	fully automated fogponics machine.
781.894	It uses the technique of fogponics --
781.894	so just fog as a nutrient,
785.334	not even water or soil --
786.937	to grow things quickly.
789.324	At the moment,
790.567	we have successfully grown tomatoes.
793.254	But we'll need more food than what
793.254	we can grow in this small room.
796.705	So what else could we forage
796.705	from the city?
799.509	Insects? Pigeons? Foxes?
805.794	Earlier, we brought back
805.794	air from the future.
808.387	This time we are bringing
808.387	an entire room from the future,
811.134	a room full of hope, tools and tactics
813.505	to create positive action
813.505	in hostile conditions.
817.384	Spending time in this room,
818.999	a room that could be our own future home,
821.086	makes the consequences
821.086	of climate change and food insecurity
824.672	much more immediate and tangible.
829.055	What we're learning through such
829.055	experiments and our practice
832.107	and the people we engage with
833.622	is that creating concrete experiences
835.897	can bridge the disconnect
835.897	between today and tomorrow.
839.761	By putting ourselves
839.761	into different possible futures,
842.679	by becoming open and willing
844.265	to embrace the uncertainty and discomfort
844.265	that such an act can bring,
848.629	we have the opportunity
848.629	to imagine new possibilities.
852.223	We can find optimistic futures;
854.151	we can find paths forward;
856.016	we can move beyond hope into action.
858.781	It means we have the chance
858.781	to change direction,
862.966	a chance to have our voices heard,
865.832	a chance to write ourselves
865.832	into a future we want.
871.548	Other worlds are possible.
874.469	Thank you.
875.66	(Applause)
