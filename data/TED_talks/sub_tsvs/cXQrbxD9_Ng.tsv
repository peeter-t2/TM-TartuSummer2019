12.328	The writer George Eliot cautioned us that,
15.277	among all forms of mistake,
17.344	prophesy is the most gratuitous.
19.707	The person that we would all acknowledge
21.555	as her 20th-century counterpart, Yogi Berra, agreed.
25.857	"He said, ""It's tough to make predictions,"
27.722	"especially about the future."""
30.458	I'm going to ignore their cautions
32.269	and make one very specific forecast.
34.242	In the world that we are creating very quickly,
36.882	we're going to see more and more things
38.595	that look like science fiction,
40.32	and fewer and fewer things that look like jobs.
43.436	Our cars are very quickly going to start driving themselves,
46.188	which means we're going to need fewer truck drivers.
48.884	We're going to hook Siri up to Watson
51.005	and use that to automate a lot of the work
53.602	that's currently done by customer service reps
55.828	and troubleshooters and diagnosers,
58.732	and we're already taking R2D2,
60.988	painting him orange, and putting him to work
64.228	carrying shelves around warehouses,
66.777	which means we need a lot fewer people
68.852	to be walking up and down those aisles.
70.818	Now, for about 200 years,
74.62	people have been saying exactly what I'm telling you --
76.803	the age of technological unemployment is at hand —
79.62	starting with the Luddites smashing looms in Britain
82.035	just about two centuries ago,
83.931	and they have been wrong.
85.963	Our economies in the developed world have coasted along
88.78	on something pretty close to full employment.
90.714	Which brings up a critical question:
92.813	Why is this time different, if it really is?
95.739	The reason it's different is that, just in the past few years,
98.735	our machines have started demonstrating skills
100.63	they have never, ever had before:
103.255	understanding, speaking, hearing, seeing,
106.515	answering, writing, and they're still acquiring new skills.
110.728	For example, mobile humanoid robots
113.298	are still incredibly primitive,
115.245	but the research arm of the Defense Department
117.083	just launched a competition
118.598	to have them do things like this,
120.912	and if the track record is any guide,
122.645	this competition is going to be successful.
125.044	So when I look around, I think the day is not too far off at all
128.68	when we're going to have androids
130.856	doing a lot of the work that we are doing right now.
133.737	And we're creating a world where there is going to be
137.495	more and more technology and fewer and fewer jobs.
141.18	It's a world that Erik Brynjolfsson and I are calling
143.429	"""the new machine age."""
144.92	The thing to keep in mind is that
147.053	this is absolutely great news.
149.602	This is the best economic news on the planet these days.
152.919	Not that there's a lot of competition, right?
156.448	This is the best economic news we have these days
158.347	for two main reasons.
159.963	The first is, technological progress is what allows us
162.948	to continue this amazing recent run that we're on
166.685	where output goes up over time,
169.206	while at the same time, prices go down,
172.532	and volume and quality just continue to explode.
176.736	Now, some people look at this and talk about
178.737	shallow materialism,
180.143	but that's absolutely the wrong way to look at it.
182.561	This is abundance, which is exactly
185.056	what we want our economic system to provide.
188.478	The second reason that the new machine age
191.694	is such great news is that, once the androids
194	start doing jobs, we don't have to do them anymore,
197.252	and we get freed up from drudgery and toil.
201.008	Now, when I talk about this with my friends
203.032	in Cambridge and Silicon Valley, they say,
205.584	"""Fantastic. No more drudgery, no more toil."
207.857	This gives us the chance to imagine
209.908	an entirely different kind of society,
212.201	a society where the creators and the discoverers
215.113	and the performers and the innovators
216.942	come together with their patrons and their financiers
220.451	to talk about issues, entertain, enlighten,
223.13	"provoke each other."""
225.208	It's a society really, that looks a lot like the TED Conference.
229.783	And there's actually a huge amount of truth here.
232.266	We are seeing an amazing flourishing taking place.
235.289	In a world where it is just about as easy
237.291	to generate an object as it is to print a document,
240.698	we have amazing new possibilities.
242.787	The people who used to be craftsmen and hobbyists
246.464	are now makers, and they're responsible
248.331	for massive amounts of innovation.
250.721	And artists who were formerly constrained
253.003	can now do things that were never, ever possible
256.171	for them before.
258.067	So this is a time of great flourishing,
260.184	and the more I look around, the more convinced I become
263.116	that this quote, from the physicist Freeman Dyson,
266.19	is not hyperbole at all.
268.223	This is just a plain statement of the facts.
271.013	We are in the middle of an astonishing period.
272.858	"[""Technology is a gift of God. After the gift of life it is perhaps the greatest of God's gifts. It is the mother of civilizations, of arts and of sciences."" — Freeman Dyson]"
273.742	Which brings up another great question:
276.533	What could possibly go wrong in this new machine age?
279.509	Right? Great, hang up, flourish, go home.
282.871	We're going to face two really thorny sets of challenges
285.537	as we head deeper into the future that we're creating.
288.33	The first are economic, and they're really nicely summarized
291.58	in an apocryphal story about a back-and-forth
294.67	between Henry Ford II and Walter Reuther,
297.712	who was the head of the auto workers union.
300.457	They were touring one of the new modern factories,
302.64	and Ford playfully turns to Reuther and says,
305.39	"""Hey Walter, how are you going to get these robots"
307.552	"to pay union dues?"""
309.366	"And Reuther shoots back, ""Hey Henry,"
311.311	"how are you going to get them to buy cars?"""
315.853	Reuther's problem in that anecdote
318.864	is that it is tough to offer your labor to an economy
322.973	that's full of machines,
324.608	and we see this very clearly in the statistics.
326.832	If you look over the past couple decades
329.224	at the returns to capital -- in other words, corporate profits --
332.888	we see them going up,
334.572	and we see that they're now at an all-time high.
336.659	If we look at the returns to labor, in other words
339.36	total wages paid out in the economy,
341.244	we see them at an all-time low
343.791	and heading very quickly in the opposite direction.
346.856	So this is clearly bad news for Reuther.
348.626	It looks like it might be great news for Ford,
352.024	but it's actually not. If you want to sell
354.328	huge volumes of somewhat expensive goods to people,
357.672	you really want a large, stable, prosperous middle class.
361.46	We have had one of those in America
363.684	for just about the entire postwar period.
366.317	But the middle class is clearly under huge threat right now.
370.669	We all know a lot of the statistics,
372.08	but just to repeat one of them,
374.439	median income in America has actually gone down
377.206	over the past 15 years,
378.897	and we're in danger of getting trapped
380.612	in some vicious cycle where inequality and polarization
384.537	continue to go up over time.
387.717	The societal challenges that come along
390.116	with that kind of inequality deserve some attention.
392.692	There are a set of societal challenges
394.36	that I'm actually not that worried about,
396.304	and they're captured by images like this.
398.655	This is not the kind of societal problem
400.477	that I am concerned about.
402.941	There is no shortage of dystopian visions
405.084	about what happens when our machines become self-aware,
408.567	and they decide to rise up and coordinate attacks against us.
411.743	I'm going to start worrying about those
413.49	the day my computer becomes aware of my printer.
416.719	(Laughter) (Applause)
420.348	So this is not the set of challenges we really need to worry about.
423.32	To tell you the kinds of societal challenges
426.108	that are going to come up in the new machine age,
428.32	I want to tell a story about two stereotypical American workers.
432.031	And to make them really stereotypical,
433.799	let's make them both white guys.
435.946	And the first one is a college-educated
439.708	professional, creative type, manager,
442.854	engineer, doctor, lawyer, that kind of worker.
445.605	"We're going to call him ""Ted."""
448.024	He's at the top of the American middle class.
450.297	His counterpart is not college-educated
453.179	and works as a laborer, works as a clerk,
456.243	does low-level white collar or blue collar work in the economy.
459.555	"We're going to call that guy ""Bill."""
461.96	And if you go back about 50 years,
464.039	Bill and Ted were leading remarkably similar lives.
467.856	For example, in 1960 they were both very likely
470.359	to have full-time jobs, working at least 40 hours a week.
473.729	But as the social researcher Charles Murray has documented,
477.025	as we started to automate the economy,
479.993	and 1960 is just about when computers started to be used by businesses,
484.14	as we started to progressively inject technology
487.011	and automation and digital stuff into the economy,
489.747	the fortunes of Bill and Ted diverged a lot.
492.772	Over this time frame, Ted has continued
494.891	to hold a full-time job. Bill hasn't.
497.643	In many cases, Bill has left the economy entirely,
501.914	and Ted very rarely has.
504.178	Over time, Ted's marriage has stayed quite happy.
507.443	Bill's hasn't.
509.084	And Ted's kids have grown up in a two-parent home,
512.406	while Bill's absolutely have not over time.
515.626	Other ways that Bill is dropping out of society?
518.03	He's decreased his voting in presidential elections,
521.719	and he's started to go to prison a lot more often.
525.712	So I cannot tell a happy story about these social trends,
529.696	and they don't show any signs of reversing themselves.
532.443	They're also true no matter which ethnic group
535.416	or demographic group we look at,
537.137	and they're actually getting so severe
539.213	that they're in danger of overwhelming
540.984	even the amazing progress we made with the Civil Rights Movement.
544.632	And what my friends in Silicon Valley
547.144	and Cambridge are overlooking is that they're Ted.
552.395	They're living these amazingly busy, productive lives,
555.832	and they've got all the benefits to show from that,
558.222	while Bill is leading a very different life.
560.657	They're actually both proof of how right Voltaire was
562.797	when he talked about the benefits of work,
565.049	and the fact that it saves us from not one but three great evils.
568.63	"[""Work saves a man from three great evils: boredom, vice and need."" — Voltaire]"
569.627	So with these challenges, what do we do about them?
572.963	The economic playbook is surprisingly clear,
575.546	surprisingly straightforward, in the short term especially.
578.686	The robots are not going to take all of our jobs in the next year or two,
581.578	so the classic Econ 101 playbook is going to work just fine:
586.046	Encourage entrepreneurship,
588.198	double down on infrastructure,
590.394	and make sure we're turning out people
592.093	from our educational system with the appropriate skills.
595.69	But over the longer term, if we are moving into an economy
598.967	that's heavy on technology and light on labor,
601.619	and we are, then we have to consider
604.047	some more radical interventions,
605.831	for example, something like a guaranteed minimum income.
609.03	Now, that's probably making some folk in this room uncomfortable,
612.742	because that idea is associated with the extreme left wing
616.599	and with fairly radical schemes for redistributing wealth.
619.818	I did a little bit of research on this notion,
621.771	and it might calm some folk down to know that
624.226	the idea of a net guaranteed minimum income
626.858	has been championed by those frothing-at-the-mouth socialists
630.035	Friedrich Hayek, Richard Nixon and Milton Friedman.
635.508	And if you find yourself worried
637.387	that something like a guaranteed income
640.696	is going to stifle our drive to succeed
642.971	and make us kind of complacent,
644.735	you might be interested to know that social mobility,
647.525	one of the things we really pride ourselves on in the United States,
650.2	is now lower than it is in the northern European countries
653.54	that have these very generous social safety nets.
656.739	So the economic playbook is actually pretty straightforward.
659.531	The societal one is a lot more challenging.
662.587	I don't know what the playbook is
664.735	for getting Bill to engage and stay engaged throughout life.
668.563	I do know that education is a huge part of it.
671.067	I witnessed this firsthand.
672.847	I was a Montessori kid for the first few years of my education,
676.603	and what that education taught me
678.132	is that the world is an interesting place
680.223	and my job is to go explore it.
682.864	The school stopped in third grade,
684.565	so then I entered the public school system,
686.633	and it felt like I had been sent to the Gulag.
690.999	With the benefit of hindsight, I now know the job
693.9	was to prepare me for life as a clerk or a laborer,
696.414	but at the time it felt like the job was to kind of
698.744	bore me into some submission with what was going on around me.
702.568	We have to do better than this.
703.916	We cannot keep turning out Bills.
707.592	So we see some green shoots that things are getting better.
709.936	We see technology deeply impacting education
712.76	and engaging people, from our youngest learners
715.288	up to our oldest ones.
717.052	We see very prominent business voices telling us
719.672	we need to rethink some of the things that we've been holding dear for a while.
722.888	And we see very serious and sustained
725.148	and data-driven efforts to understand
727.952	how to intervene in some of the most troubled communities that we have.
731.495	So the green shoots are out there.
733.704	I don't want to pretend for a minute
735.138	that what we have is going to be enough.
737.08	We're facing very tough challenges.
739.222	To give just one example, there are about five million Americans
742.328	who have been unemployed for at least six months.
745.142	We're not going to fix things for them
746.484	by sending them back to Montessori.
748.927	And my biggest worry is that we're creating a world
751.282	where we're going to have glittering technologies
753.831	embedded in kind of a shabby society
756.136	and supported by an economy that generates inequality
759.103	instead of opportunity.
760.584	But I actually don't think that's what we're going to do.
763.336	I think we're going to do something a lot better
764.965	for one very straightforward reason:
767.075	The facts are getting out there.
769.043	The realities of this new machine age
771.085	and the change in the economy are becoming more widely known.
774.4	If we wanted to accelerate that process, we could do things
777.251	like have our best economists and policymakers
780.017	"play ""Jeopardy!"" against Watson."
782.436	We could send Congress on an autonomous car road trip.
785.986	And if we do enough of these kinds of things,
787.639	the awareness is going to sink in that things are going to be different.
791.043	And then we're off to the races,
792.814	because I don't believe for a second
795.244	that we have forgotten how to solve tough challenges
798.212	or that we have become too apathetic or hard-hearted to even try.
802.562	I started my talk with quotes from wordsmiths
804.956	who were separated by an ocean and a century.
807.772	Let me end it with words from politicians
809.924	who were similarly distant.
811.655	Winston Churchill came to my home of MIT in 1949,
814.988	"and he said, ""If we are to bring the broad masses"
817.136	of the people in every land to the table of abundance,
820.846	it can only be by the tireless improvement
823.876	"of all of our means of technical production."""
826.849	Abraham Lincoln realized there was one other ingredient.
829.468	"He said, ""I am a firm believer in the people."
832.366	If given the truth, they can be depended upon
834.699	to meet any national crisis.
837.068	"The great point is to give them the plain facts."""
839.852	So the optimistic note, great point that I want to leave you with
842.962	is that the plain facts of the machine age are becoming clear,
846.107	and I have every confidence that we're going to use them
848.564	to chart a good course into the challenging,
851.479	abundant economy that we're creating.
854.012	Thank you very much.
855.703	(Applause)
