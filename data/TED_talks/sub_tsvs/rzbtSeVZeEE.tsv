12.763	I want you all to think
16.603	about the third word
16.603	that was ever said about you --
23.582	or, if you were delivering,
26.638	about the person you were delivering.
31.864	And you can all mouth it
31.864	if you want or say it out loud.
35.729	"It was -- the first two were, ""It's a ..."""
41.31	Audience: (Mixed reply) Girl. Boy.
43.355	(Laughter)
44.38	Well, it shows you that --
46.006	I also deal with issues
46.006	where there's not certainty
49.109	of whether it's a girl or a boy,
50.708	so the mixed answer was very appropriate.
54.336	Of course, now the answer often comes
54.336	not at birth but at the ultrasound,
58.994	unless the prospective parents
58.994	choose to be surprised,
62.972	like we all were.
65.835	But I want you to think about what it is
65.835	that leads to that statement
72.859	on the third word,
74.899	because the third word
77.4	is a description of your sex.
85.159	And by that I mean,
87.572	made by a description of your genitals.
92.436	Now, as a pediatric endocrinologist,
95.504	I used to be very, very involved
95.504	and still somewhat am, in cases
101.005	in which there are mismatches
101.005	in the externals
107.293	or between the externals
107.293	and the internals,
111.331	and we literally have to figure out
116.168	what is the description of your sex.
120.502	But there is nothing
120.502	that is definable at the time of birth
125.808	that would define you.
130.101	And when I talk about definition,
132.268	I'm talking about your sexual orientation.
138.274	"We don't say, ""It's a ... gay boy!"""
143.668	"""A lesbian girl!"""
146.449	Those situations don't
146.449	really define themselves
149.982	more until the second decade of life.
153.971	Nor do they define your gender,
158.952	which, as different
158.952	from your anatomic sex,
162.564	describes your self-concept:
165.838	Do you see yourself as a male or female,
171.37	or somewhere in the spectrum in between?
176.593	That sometimes shows up
181.896	in the first decade of life,
184.88	but it can be very confusing for parents,
188.526	because it is quite normative for children
193.257	to act in a cross-gender play and way,
197.634	and, in fact, there are studies that show
199.968	that even 80 percent of children
199.968	who act in that fashion
205.82	will not persist in wanting
205.82	to be the opposite gender
212.762	at the time when puberty begins.
216.746	But, at the time that puberty begins --
222.206	that means between about age 10 to 12
222.206	in girls, 12 to 14 in boys --
229.239	with breast budding,
230.97	or two to three times'
230.97	increase in the gonads
234.867	in the case of genetic males,
237.736	by that particular point,
239.386	the child who says
239.386	they are in the absolute wrong body
245.504	is almost certain to be transgender
249.291	and is extremely unlikely
249.291	to change those feelings,
256.303	no matter how anybody tries
256.303	reparative therapy
260.862	or any other noxious things.
264.742	Now, this is relatively rare,
267.213	so I had relatively little
267.213	personal experience with this.
270.929	And my experience was more typical,
273.607	only because I had an adolescent practice.
275.671	And I saw someone age 24,
277.363	genetically female, went through Harvard
277.363	with three male roommates
281.954	who knew the whole story,
283.314	a registrar who always listed his name
283.314	on course lists as a male name,
289.355	and came to me after graduating,
292.33	"saying, ""Help me. I know you know"
292.33	"a lot of endocrinology."""
296.348	And indeed, I've treated a lot of people
296.348	who were born without gonads.
299.68	This wasn't rocket science.
301.348	But I made a deal with him:
302.975	"""I'll treat you if you teach me."""
305.9	And so he did.
309.161	And what an education I got
310.995	from taking care of all the members
310.995	of his support group.
315.647	And then I got really confused,
318.194	because I thought it was
318.194	relatively easy at that age
320.751	to just give people the hormones
322.358	of the gender
322.358	in which they were affirming.
326.595	But then my patient married,
329.825	and he married a woman
329.825	who had been born as a male,
334.655	had married as a male, had two children,
337.958	then went through
337.958	a transition into female.
343.721	And now this delightful female
348.536	was attached to my male patient --
348.536	in fact, got legally married,
354.226	because they showed up as a man
354.226	and a woman, and who knew, right?
357.502	(Laughter)
359.966	And I was confused --
363.501	"""Does this make so-and-so gay?"
365.922	"Does this make so-and-so straight?"""
367.696	I was getting sexual orientation
367.696	confused with gender identity.
373.609	And my patient said to me,
375.808	"""Look, look, look."
377.3	If you just think of the following,
377.3	you'll get it right:
380.737	Sexual orientation
380.737	is who you go to bed with.
384.004	"Gender identity is who you go to bed as."""
387.802	(Laughter)
389.827	And I subsequently learned
389.827	from the many adults --
392.643	I took care of about 200 adults --
395.189	I learned from them
396.883	that if I didn't peek as to who
396.883	their partner was in the waiting room,
401.542	I would never be able to guess
401.542	better than chance,
405.241	whether they were gay,
405.241	straight, bi or asexual
409.463	in their affirmed gender.
411.631	In other words,
412.877	one thing has absolutely nothing
412.877	to do with the other.
417.46	And the data show it.
422.075	Now, as I took care of the 200 adults,
424.248	I found it extremely painful.
426.814	These people -- many of them --
429.821	had to give up so much of their lives.
434.122	Sometimes their parents would reject them,
436.577	siblings, their own children,
438.95	and then their divorcing spouse
440.721	would forbid them
440.721	from seeing their children.
444.724	It was so awful,
446.509	but why did they do it at 40 and 50?
450.289	Because they felt
450.289	they had to affirm themselves
455.058	before they would kill themselves.
457.316	And indeed, the rate of suicide
457.316	among untreated transgendered people
463.286	is among the highest in the world.
467.057	So, what to do?
469.02	I was intrigued, in going
469.02	to a conference in Holland,
472.956	where they are experts in this,
475.226	and saw the most remarkable thing.
478.623	They were treating young adolescents
481.869	after giving them the most intense
481.869	psychometric testing of gender,
487.863	and they were treating them by blocking
487.863	the puberty that they didn't want.
492.283	Because basically,
492.283	kids look about the same,
494.869	each sex, until they go through puberty,
497.888	at which point, if you feel
497.888	you're in the wrong sex,
500.605	you feel like Pinocchio becoming a donkey.
503.675	The fantasy that you had
503.675	that your body will change
506.24	to be who you want it to be, with puberty,
508.915	actually is nullified
508.915	by the puberty you get.
513.779	And they fall apart.
517.328	So that's why putting the puberty
517.328	on hold -- why on hold?
520.828	You can't just give them
520.828	the opposite hormones that young.
523.902	They'll end up stunted in growth,
525.761	and you think you can have
525.761	a meaningful conversation
528.333	about the fertility effects
528.333	of such treatment
530.847	with a 10-year-old girl,
530.847	a 12-year-old boy?
534.663	So this buys time
534.663	in the diagnostic process
537.193	for four or five years,
539.045	so that they can work it out.
541.819	They can have more and more testing,
544.471	they can live without feeling their bodies
544.471	are running away from them.
548.464	And then, in a program they call 12-16-18,
552.646	around age 12 is when they
552.646	give the blocking hormones,
557.519	and then at age 16, with retesting,
559.983	they re-qualify to receive --
562.289	now remember, the blocking
562.289	hormones are reversible,
565.285	but when you give the hormones
565.285	of the opposite sex,
568.19	you now start spouting breasts
568.19	and facial hair and voice change,
571.531	depending on what you're using,
573.297	and those effects are permanent,
575.423	or require surgery to remove,
577.265	or electrolysis,
578.52	and you can never really affect the voice.
581.027	So this is serious,
581.027	and this is 15-, 16-year-old stuff.
585.184	And then at 18,
585.184	they're eligible for surgery.
588.772	And while there's no good surgery
588.772	for females to males genitally,
592.888	the male-to-female surgery
592.888	has fooled gynecologists.
597.381	That's how good it can be.
600.087	So I looked at how
600.087	the patients were doing,
604.088	and I looked at patients
604.088	who just looked like everybody else,
606.974	except they were pubertally delayed.
609.729	But once they gave them the hormones
611.666	consistent with the gender they affirm,
614.299	they look beautiful.
616.229	They look normal.
618.04	They had normal heights.
619.935	You would never be able
619.935	to pick them out in a crowd.
624.522	So at that point, I decided
624.522	I'm going to do this.
627.103	This is really where the pediatric
627.103	endocrine realm comes in,
631.611	because, in fact, if you're going to deal
631.611	with it in kids aged 10 to 14,
636.452	that's pediatric endocrinology.
639.354	So I brought some kids in,
643.513	and this now became the standard of care,
646.098	and the [Boston]
646.098	Children's Hospital was behind it.
648.927	By my showing them
648.927	the kids before and after,
653.094	people who never got treated
653.094	and people who wished to be treated,
656.939	and pictures of the Dutch --
660.035	they came to me and said,
661.28	"""You've got to do"
661.28	"something for these kids."""
663.511	Well, where were these kids before?
666.774	They were out there suffering,
666.774	is where they were.
669.894	So we started a program in 2007.
676.062	It became the first program of its kind --
678.482	but it's really of the Dutch kind --
680.863	in North America.
682.927	And since then, we have 160 patients.
687.18	Did they come from Afghanistan? No.
	from within 150 miles of Boston.
698.701	And some came from England.
702.138	Jackie had been abused
702.138	in the Midlands, in England.
706.205	She's 12 years old there,
708.091	she was living as a girl,
709.428	but she was being beaten up.
711.61	It was a horror show,
711.61	they had to homeschool her.
714.649	And the reason the British were coming
717.017	was because they would not treat
717.017	anybody with anything under age 16,
722.741	which means they were consigning
722.741	them to an adult body
726.478	no matter what happened,
727.961	even if they tested them well.
730.108	Jackie, on top of it, was,
730.108	by virtue of skeletal markings,
734.81	destined to be six feet five.
739.138	And yet, she had just begun
739.138	a male puberty.
742.938	Well, I did something
742.938	a little bit innovative,
746.537	because I do know hormones,
748.659	and that estrogen is much more potent
750.621	in closing epiphyses, the growth plates,
754.435	and stopping growth, than testosterone is.
757.752	So we blocked her testosterone
757.752	with a blocking hormone,
762.505	but we added estrogen,
762.505	not at 16, but at 13.
766.909	And so here she is at 16, on the left.
770.093	And on her 16th birthday,
770.093	she went to Thailand,
772.395	where they would do
772.395	a genital plastic surgery.
774.697	They will do it at 18 now.
776.597	"And she ended up 5'11""."
779.312	But more than that,
779.312	she has normal breast size,
782.559	because by blocking testosterone,
784.871	every one of our patients
784.871	has normal breast size
788.249	if they get to us at the appropriate age,
791.283	not too late.
793.057	And on the far right, there she is.
794.84	She went public -- semifinalist
794.84	in the Miss England competition.
801.068	The judges debated
801.068	as to, can they do this?
804.134	And one of them quipped, I'm told,
808.309	"""But she has more natural self"
808.309	"than half the other contestants."""
812.299	(Laughter)
814.211	And some of them
814.211	have been rearranged a little bit,
818.482	but it's all her DNA.
821.679	And she's become a remarkable spokeswoman.
825.121	And she was offered contracts as a model,
829.006	at which point
829.006	she teased me, when she said,
831.155	"""You know, I might have had"
831.155	a better chance as a model
833.724	"if you'd made me six feet one."""
835.456	(Laughter)
837.46	Go figure.
840.038	So this picture, I think, says it all.
843.74	It really says it all.
845.76	These are Nicole and brother Jonas,
849.408	identical twin boys,
852.427	and proven to be identical.
855.978	Nicole had affirmed herself
855.978	as a girl as early as age three.
859.596	At age seven, they changed her name,
862.127	and came to me at the very
862.127	beginnings of a male puberty.
866.904	Now you can imagine
866.904	looking at Jonas at only 14,
869.712	that male puberty is early in this family,
872.523	because he looks more like a 16-year-old.
875.086	But it makes the point all the more,
876.92	of why you have to be conscious
876.92	of where the patient is.
880.665	Nicole is on pubertal blockade in here,
884.451	and Jonas is just going --
884.451	biologic control.
888.189	This is what Nicole would look like
889.91	if we weren't doing what we were doing.
891.991	He's got a prominent Adam's apple.
894.482	He's got angular bones
894.482	to the face, a mustache,
898.063	and you can see there's
898.063	a height difference,
900.15	because he's gone through
900.15	a growth spurt that she won't get.
903.053	Now Nicole is on estrogen.
904.594	She has a bit of a form to her.
907.887	This family went
907.887	to the White House last spring,
911.526	because of their work in overturning
911.526	an anti-discrimination --
917.289	there was a bill that would block
919.695	the right of transgender people in Maine
919.695	to use public bathrooms,
924.322	and it looked like the bill
924.322	was going to pass,
927.091	and that would have been a problem,
928.822	but Nicole went personally
928.822	to every legislator in Maine
932.323	"and said, ""I can do this."
934.335	If they see me, they'll understand
936.351	why I'm no threat in the ladies' room,
938.521	but I can be threatened
938.521	"in the men's room."""
940.627	And then they finally got it.
944.038	So where do we go from here?
947.022	Well, we still have a ways to go
947.022	in terms of anti-discrimination.
951.115	There are only 17 states
951.115	that have an anti-discrimination law
954.806	against discrimination in housing,
957.406	employment, public accommodation --
960.522	only 17 states, and five of them
960.522	are in New England.
963.534	We need less expensive drugs.
965.459	They cost a fortune.
967.164	And we need to get
967.164	this condition out of the DSM.
971.081	It is as much a psychiatric disease
971.081	as being gay and lesbian,
975.805	and that went out the window in 1973,
978.748	and the whole world changed.
980.649	And this isn't going to break
980.649	anybody's budget.
983.018	This is not that common.
985.279	But the risks of not
985.279	doing anything for them
990.005	not only puts all of them at risk
990.005	of losing their lives to suicide,
996.501	but it also says something about
996.501	whether we are a truly inclusive society.
1002.777	Thank you.
1003.952	(Applause)
