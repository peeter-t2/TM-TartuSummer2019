12.629	So here's the most important economic fact of our time.
17.917	We are living in an age of surging income inequality,
21.947	particularly between those at the very top
24.872	and everyone else.
26.708	This shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K.,
30.73	but it's a global phenomenon.
32.928	It's happening in communist China,
35.251	in formerly communist Russia,
36.974	it's happening in India, in my own native Canada.
40.268	We're even seeing it in cozy social democracies
43.235	like Sweden, Finland and Germany.
46.86	Let me give you a few numbers to place what's happening.
50.771	In the 1970s, the One Percent
53.48	accounted for about 10 percent of the national income
57.757	in the United States.
59.521	Today, their share has more than doubled
62.83	to above 20 percent.
65.269	But what's even more striking
67.369	is what's happening at the very tippy top
70.055	of the income distribution.
72.297	The 0.1 percent in the U.S.
75.301	today account for more than eight percent
78.53	of the national income.
80.42	They are where the One Percent was 30 years ago.
84.913	Let me give you another number to put that in perspective,
87.681	and this is a figure that was calculated in 2005
91.199	by Robert Reich,
92.658	the Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration.
95.397	Reich took the wealth of two admittedly very rich men,
100.701	Bill Gates and Warren Buffett,
103.421	and he found that it was equivalent to the wealth
106.37	of the bottom 40 percent of the U.S. population,
113.965	Now, as it happens,
116.329	Warren Buffett is not only himself a plutocrat,
119.133	he is one of the most astute observers of that phenomenon,
122.86	and he has his own favorite number.
126.162	Buffett likes to point out that in 1992,
130.105	the combined wealth of the people
132.267	on the Forbes 400 list --
134.596	and this is the list of the 400 richest Americans --
137.993	was 300 billion dollars.
140.765	Just think about it.
141.966	You didn't even need to be a billionaire
143.993	to get on that list in 1992.
146.966	Well, today, that figure has more than quintupled
150.979	to 1.7 trillion,
153.865	and I probably don't need to tell you
156.043	that we haven't seen anything similar happen
158.504	to the middle class,
159.889	whose wealth has stagnated if not actually decreased.
164.59	So we're living in the age of the global plutocracy,
168.65	but we've been slow to notice it.
170.691	One of the reasons, I think,
172.374	is a sort of boiled frog phenomenon.
175.352	Changes which are slow and gradual
177.915	can be hard to notice
179.455	even if their ultimate impact is quite dramatic.
182.359	Think about what happened, after all, to the poor frog.
185.591	But I think there's something else going on.
188.406	Talking about income inequality,
190.516	even if you're not on the Forbes 400 list,
193.047	can make us feel uncomfortable.
195.188	It feels less positive, less optimistic,
198.633	to talk about how the pie is sliced
201.162	than to think about how to make the pie bigger.
204.214	And if you do happen to be on the Forbes 400 list,
206.942	talking about income distribution,
209.74	and inevitably its cousin, income redistribution,
213.427	can be downright threatening.
215.967	So we're living in the age of surging income inequality,
220.243	especially at the top.
222.356	What's driving it, and what can we do about it?
225.944	One set of causes is political:
229.61	lower taxes, deregulation, particularly of financial services,
235.205	privatization, weaker legal protections for trade unions,
240.335	all of these have contributed
242.775	to more and more income going to the very, very top.
246.892	A lot of these political factors can be broadly lumped
250.315	"under the category of ""crony capitalism,"""
253.644	political changes that benefit a group
255.821	of well-connected insiders
257.983	but don't actually do much good for the rest of us.
261.521	In practice, getting rid of crony capitalism
264.91	is incredibly difficult.
266.951	Think of all the years reformers of various stripes
270.444	have tried to get rid of corruption in Russia, for instance,
273.838	or how hard it is to re-regulate the banks
276.867	even after the most profound financial crisis
280.024	since the Great Depression,
281.646	or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies,
286.242	"including those whose motto might be ""don't do evil,"""
290.253	to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that
293.027	paid by the middle class.
295.135	But while getting rid of crony capitalism in practice
298.171	is really, really hard,
300.167	at least intellectually, it's an easy problem.
303.635	After all, no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism.
309.284	Indeed, this is one of those rare issues
311.931	that unites the left and the right.
315.166	A critique of crony capitalism is as central
317.986	to the Tea Party as it is to Occupy Wall Street.
322.283	But if crony capitalism is, intellectually at least,
326.621	the easy part of the problem,
328.656	things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers
331.931	of surging income inequality.
334.684	In and of themselves, these aren't too mysterious.
338.423	Globalization and the technology revolution,
341.47	the twin economic transformations
344.01	which are changing our lives
345.708	and transforming the global economy,
347.805	are also powering the rise of the super-rich.
351.272	Just think about it.
352.852	For the first time in history,
354.84	if you are an energetic entrepreneur
357.579	with a brilliant new idea
359.278	or a fantastic new product,
361.693	you have almost instant, almost frictionless access
365.372	to a global market of more than a billion people.
369.352	As a result, if you are very, very smart
373.186	and very, very lucky,
374.981	you can get very, very rich
377.832	very, very quickly.
380.362	The latest poster boy for this phenomenon
383.204	is David Karp.
385.184	The 26-year-old founder of Tumblr
388.039	recently sold his company to Yahoo
390.821	for 1.1 billion dollars.
393.854	Think about that for a minute:
395.392	1.1 billion dollars, 26 years old.
399.806	It's easiest to see how the technology revolution
403.253	and globalization are creating this sort of superstar effect
406.874	in highly visible fields,
408.817	like sports and entertainment.
411.12	We can all watch how a fantastic athlete
414.495	or a fantastic performer can today leverage his or her skills
418.839	across the global economy as never before.
422.507	But today, that superstar effect
424.587	is happening across the entire economy.
427.569	We have superstar technologists.
429.746	We have superstar bankers.
431.467	We have superstar lawyers and superstar architects.
434.803	There are superstar cooks
436.232	and superstar farmers.
437.744	There are even, and this is my personal favorite example,
440.527	superstar dentists,
442.518	the most dazzling exemplar of whom
444.622	is Bernard Touati, the Frenchman who ministers
447.984	to the smiles of fellow superstars
450.303	like Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich
452.984	or European-born American fashion designer
455.845	Diane von Furstenberg.
457.89	But while it's pretty easy to see how globalization
460.973	and the technology revolution
462.885	are creating this global plutocracy,
465.356	what's a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it.
469.523	And that's because,
471.049	in contrast with crony capitalism,
473.426	so much of what globalization and the technology revolution
477.336	have done is highly positive.
479.699	Let's start with technology.
481.434	I love the Internet. I love my mobile devices.
485.044	I love the fact that they mean that
486.878	whoever chooses to will be able to watch this talk
490.564	far beyond this auditorium.
492.611	I'm even more of a fan of globalization.
495.72	This is the transformation
497.707	which has lifted hundreds of millions
500.131	of the world's poorest people out of poverty
503.18	and into the middle class,
504.622	and if you happen to live in the rich part of the world,
507.664	it's made many new products affordable --
511.171	who do you think built your iPhone? —
513.697	and things that we've relied on for a long time much cheaper.
517.519	Think of your dishwasher or your t-shirt.
520.143	So what's not to like?
522.679	Well, a few things.
524.571	One of the things that worries me
526.675	is how easily what you might call meritocratic plutocracy
530.838	can become crony plutocracy.
533.534	Imagine you're a brilliant entrepreneur
536.193	who has successfully sold that idea or that product
539.57	to the global billions
540.949	and become a billionaire in the process.
543.515	It gets tempting at that point
545.884	to use your economic nous
548.859	to manipulate the rules of the global political economy
553.131	in your own favor.
555.217	And that's no mere hypothetical example.
557.966	Think about Amazon, Apple, Google, Starbucks.
562.395	These are among the world's most admired,
564.499	most beloved, most innovative companies.
567.045	They also happen to be particularly adept
569.969	at working the international tax system
572.207	so as to lower their tax bill very, very significantly.
576.765	And why stop at just playing the global political
581.08	and economic system as it exists
583.168	to your own maximum advantage?
585.313	Once you have the tremendous economic power
589.63	that we're seeing at the very, very top of the income distribution
592.703	and the political power that inevitably entails,
595.953	it becomes tempting as well
598.466	to start trying to change the rules of the game
602.054	in your own favor.
604.156	Again, this is no mere hypothetical.
606.89	It's what the Russian oligarchs did
608.825	in creating the sale-of-the-century privatization
612.087	of Russia's natural resources.
614.057	It's one way of describing what happened
615.831	with deregulation of the financial services
617.866	in the U.S. and the U.K.
620.101	A second thing that worries me
622.027	is how easily meritocratic plutocracy
624.758	can become aristocracy.
627.504	One way of describing the plutocrats
629.579	is as alpha geeks,
631.386	and they are people who are acutely aware
633.9	of how important highly sophisticated
636.308	analytical and quantitative skills are in today's economy.
640.49	That's why they are spending
642.909	unprecedented time and resources
645.686	educating their own children.
647.583	The middle class is spending more on schooling too,
650.85	but in the global educational arms race
653.211	that starts at nursery school
654.995	and ends at Harvard, Stanford or MIT,
658.733	the 99 percent is increasingly outgunned
662.211	by the One Percent.
663.75	The result is something that economists Alan Krueger
666.456	and Miles Corak call the Great Gatsby Curve.
670.161	As income inequality increases,
672.964	social mobility decreases.
675.737	The plutocracy may be a meritocracy,
678.495	but increasingly you have to be born
680.711	on the top rung of the ladder to even take part in that race.
685.595	The third thing, and this is what worries me the most,
688.619	is the extent to which those same largely positive forces
692.97	which are driving the rise of the global plutocracy
696.16	also happen to be hollowing out the middle class
699.592	in Western industrialized economies.
702.546	Let's start with technology.
704.633	Those same forces that are creating billionaires
707.706	are also devouring many traditional middle-class jobs.
711.729	When's the last time you used a travel agent?
714.668	And in contrast with the industrial revolution,
717.749	the titans of our new economy
719.905	aren't creating that many new jobs.
722.707	At its zenith, G.M. employed hundreds of thousands,
726.526	Facebook fewer than 10,000.
729.549	The same is true of globalization.
732.219	For all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people
735.462	out of poverty in the emerging markets,
737.802	it's also outsourcing a lot of jobs
740.668	from the developed Western economies.
742.969	The terrifying reality is
745.736	that there is no economic rule
747.993	which automatically translates
750.93	increased economic growth
752.633	into widely shared prosperity.
754.943	That's shown in what I consider to be
757.617	the most scary economic statistic of our time.
761.3	Since the late 1990s, increases in productivity
765.358	have been decoupled from increases
768.036	in wages and employment.
769.97	That means that our countries are getting richer,
772.914	our companies are getting more efficient,
775.538	but we're not creating more jobs
777.479	and we're not paying people, as a whole, more.
781.35	One scary conclusion you could draw from all of this
785.559	is to worry about structural unemployment.
789.27	What worries me more is a different nightmare scenario.
793.057	After all, in a totally free labor market,
795.649	we could find jobs for pretty much everyone.
798.851	The dystopia that worries me
800.879	is a universe in which a few geniuses
804.525	invent Google and its ilk
806.605	and the rest of us are employed giving them massages.
811.8	So when I get really depressed about all of this,
814.433	I comfort myself in thinking about the Industrial Revolution.
818.262	After all, for all its grim, satanic mills,
822.157	it worked out pretty well, didn't it?
824.657	After all, all of us here are richer, healthier, taller --
831.68	well, there are a few exceptions —
833.706	and live longer than our ancestors in the early 19th century.
838.697	But it's important to remember
841.281	that before we learned how to share the fruits
844.103	of the Industrial Revolution
845.782	with the broad swathes of society,
848.345	we had to go through two depressions,
851.74	the Great Depression of the 1930s,
853.599	the Long Depression of the 1870s,
856.453	two world wars, communist revolutions
859.62	in Russia and in China,
861.699	and an era of tremendous social
864.024	and political upheaval in the West.
866.78	We also, not coincidentally,
869.5	went through an era of tremendous
872.038	social and political inventions.
874.617	We created the modern welfare state.
876.961	We created public education.
878.703	We created public health care.
880.407	We created public pensions.
882.182	We created unions.
884.207	Today, we are living through an era
886.723	of economic transformation
888.684	comparable in its scale and its scope
891.99	to the Industrial Revolution.
894.258	To be sure that this new economy benefits us all
897.449	and not just the plutocrats,
899.567	we need to embark on an era
901.231	of comparably ambitious social and political change.
905.15	We need a new New Deal.
907.808	(Applause)
