16.26	I'm here today to share with you
18.26	an extraordinary journey -
20.26	extraordinarily rewarding journey,
20.26	actually -
23.26	which brought me into
25.26	training rats
27.26	to save human lives
29.26	by detecting landmines
31.26	and tuberculosis.
33.26	As a child, I had two passions.
36.26	One was a passion for rodents.
39.26	I had all kinds of rats,
41.26	mice, hamsters,
43.26	gerbils, squirrels.
45.26	You name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops.
48.26	(Laughter)
50.26	I also had a passion for Africa.
53.26	Growing up in a multicultural environment,
55.26	we had African students in the house,
57.26	and I learned about their stories,
59.26	so different backgrounds,
61.26	dependency on imported know-how,
64.26	goods, services,
66.26	exuberant cultural diversity.
69.26	Africa was truly fascinating for me.
71.26	I became an industrial engineer,
73.26	engineer in product development,
75.26	and I focused on appropriate detection technologies,
78.26	actually the first appropriate technologies
80.26	for developing countries.
83.26	I started working in the industry,
85.26	but I wasn't really happy to contribute
87.26	to a material consumer society
90.26	in a linear, extracting
93.26	and manufacturing mode.
95.26	I quit my job to focus on the real world problem:
97.26	landmines.
100.26	We're talking '95 now.
103.26	Princess Diana is announcing on TV
106.26	that landmines form a structural barrier
108.26	to any development, which is really true.
111.26	As long as these devices are there,
113.26	or there is suspicion of landmines,
115.26	you can't really enter into the land.
117.26	Actually, there was an appeal worldwide
119.26	for new detectors
122.26	sustainable in the environments
124.26	where they're needed to produce,
126.26	which is mainly in the developing world.
128.26	We chose rats.
130.26	Why would you choose rats?
132.26	Because, aren't they vermin?
134.26	Well, actually rats are,
136.26	in contrary to what most people think about them,
138.26	rats are highly sociable creatures.
142.26	And actually, our product -- what you see here.
145.26	There's a target somewhere here.
147.26	You see an operator, a trained African
149.26	with his rats in front
151.26	who actually are left and right.
153.26	There, the animal finds a mine.
155.26	It scratches on the soil.
157.26	And the animal comes back for a food reward.
160.26	Very, very simple.
162.26	Very sustainable in this environment.
165.26	Here, the animal gets its food reward.
168.26	And that's how it works.
170.26	Very, very simple.
172.26	Now why would you use rats?
174.26	Rats have been used since the '50s last century,
176.26	in all kinds of experiments.
179.26	Rats have more genetic material
182.26	allocated to olfaction
184.26	than any other mammal species.
186.26	They're extremely sensitive to smell.
189.26	Moreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells
192.26	and to communicate about it.
195.26	Now how do we communicate with rats?
197.26	Well don't talk rat,
200.26	but we have a clicker,
202.26	a standard method for animal training,
204.26	which you see there.
206.26	A clicker, which makes a particular sound
209.26	with which you can reinforce particular behaviors.
212.26	First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward,
215.26	which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.
219.26	Once the animal knows click, food,
221.26	click, food, click, food --
223.26	so click is food --
225.26	we bring it in a cage with a hole,
227.26	and actually the animal learns
229.26	to stick the nose in the hole
231.26	under which a target scent is placed,
233.26	and to do that for five seconds --
235.26	five seconds, which is long for a rat.
237.26	Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult.
240.26	It learns how to find the target smell
243.26	in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.
246.26	Then the animal learns
248.26	to walk on a leash in the open
250.26	and find targets.
252.26	In the next step, animals learn
255.26	to find real mines in real minefields.
257.26	They are tested and accredited
260.26	according to International Mine Action Standards,
262.26	just like dogs have to pass a test.
265.26	This consists of 400 square meters.
267.26	There's a number of mines
270.26	placed blindly,
272.26	and the team of trainer and their rat
275.26	have to find all the targets.
279.26	If the animal does that, it gets a license
282.26	as an accredited animal
284.26	to be operational in the field --
286.26	just like dogs, by the way.
288.26	Maybe one slight difference:
290.26	we can train rats at a fifth of the price
293.26	of training the mining dog.
295.26	This is our team in Mozambique:
297.26	one Tanzanian trainer,
299.26	who transfers the skills
301.26	to these three Mozambican fellows.
303.26	And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people.
306.26	They have a skill,
308.26	which makes them much less dependent
310.26	on foreign aid.
312.26	Moreover, this small team
315.26	together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles
318.26	and the manual de-miners to follow-up.
321.26	But with this small investment in a rat capacity,
324.26	we have demonstrated in Mozambique
327.26	that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter
330.26	up to 60 percent
332.26	of what is currently normal --
334.26	two dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18,
336.26	and we can still bring that price down.
338.26	Question of scale.
340.26	If you can bring in more rats,
342.26	we can actually make the output even bigger.
344.26	We have a demonstration site in Mozambique.
347.26	Eleven African governments
350.26	have seen that they can become less dependent
353.26	by using this technology.
355.26	They have signed the pact for peace
357.26	and treaty in the Great Lakes region,
360.26	and they endorse hero rats
363.26	to clear their common borders of landmines.
366.26	But let me bring you to a very different problem.
369.26	And there's about 6,000 people last year
371.26	that walked on a landmine,
373.26	but worldwide last year,
375.26	almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis
377.26	as a first cause of infection.
381.26	Especially in Africa
383.26	where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked,
386.26	there is a huge common problem.
391.26	Microscopy, the standard WHO procedure,
394.26	reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability.
398.26	In Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie --
404.26	get diagnosed with T.B. before they die.
408.26	It means that, if you have T.B.,
411.26	you have more chance that you won't be detected,
413.26	but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on.
420.26	And if, however,
422.26	you are detected very early, diagnosed early,
424.26	treatment can start,
426.26	and even in HIV-positives, it makes sense.
429.26	You can actually cure T.B.,
431.26	even in HIV-positives.
434.26	So in our common language, Dutch,
437.26	the name for T.B.
439.26	"is ""tering,"""
441.26	which, etymologically,
443.26	refers to the smell of tar.
446.26	Already the old Chinese
448.26	and the Greek, Hippocrates,
451.26	have actually published,
453.26	documented, that T.B. can be diagnosed
456.26	based on the volatiles
458.26	exuding from patients.
461.26	So what we did is we collected some samples --
463.26	just as a way of testing --
465.26	from hospitals,
467.26	trained rats on them
470.26	and see if this works,
472.26	and wonder, well,
474.26	we can reach 89 percent sensitivity,
478.26	using multiple rats in a row.
480.26	This is how it works,
483.26	and really, this is a generic technology.
486.26	We're talking now explosives, tuberculosis,
489.26	but can you imagine,
491.26	you can actually put anything under there.
493.26	So how does it work?
495.26	You have a cassette with 10 samples.
497.26	You put these 10 samples at once in the cage.
500.26	An animal only needs two hundredths of a second
502.26	to discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast.
505.26	Here it's already at the third sample.
508.26	This is a positive sample.
512.26	It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward.
517.26	And by doing so, very fast,
519.26	we can have like a second-line opinion
522.26	to see which patients are positive,
524.26	which are negative.
527.26	Just as an indication,
529.26	whereas a microscopist can process
533.26	a rat can process
535.26	the same amount of samples
537.26	in seven minutes only.
539.26	A cage like this --
541.26	(Applause)
546.26	A cage like this -- provided that you have rats,
549.26	and we have now currently
553.26	a cage like this, operating throughout the day,
556.26	can process 1,680 samples.
561.26	Can you imagine the potential offspring applications --
564.26	environmental detection
566.26	of pollutants in soils,
568.26	customs applications,
570.26	detection of illicit goods in containers and so on.
574.26	But let's stick first to tuberculosis.
576.26	I just want to briefly highlight,
578.26	the blue rods
580.26	are the scores of microscopy only
582.26	at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam
585.26	on a population of 500,000 people,
587.26	where 15,000 reported to get a test done.
590.26	Microscopy for 1,800 patients.
593.26	And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats
597.26	and looping those results back,
600.26	we were able to increase case detection rates
602.26	by over 30 percent.
604.26	Throughout last year,
606.26	we've been -- depending on which intervals you take --
608.26	we've been consistently
610.26	increasing case detection rates
612.26	in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam
614.26	between 30 and 40 percent.
617.26	So this is really considerable.
619.26	Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy
621.26	infects up to 15 people,
623.26	healthy people, per year,
625.26	you can be sure
627.26	that we have saved lots of lives.
629.26	At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.
632.26	The way forward for us
634.26	is now to standardize this technology.
636.26	And there are simple things
638.26	like, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole
642.26	where the animal has to stick for five seconds.
644.26	So, to standardize this.
646.26	Also, to standardize the pellets,
648.26	the food rewards,
650.26	and to semi-automate this
652.26	in order to replicate this on a much larger scale
655.26	and affect the lives of many more people.
658.26	To conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon.
661.26	Here is a first prototype
663.26	of our camera rat,
665.26	which is a rat with a rat backpack
667.26	with a camera that can go under rubble
669.26	to detect for victims
671.26	after earthquake and so on.
673.26	This is in a prototype stage.
675.26	We don't have a working system here yet.
678.26	To conclude, I would actually like to say,
681.26	you may think this is about rats, these projects,
683.26	but in the end it is about people.
685.26	It is about empowering vulnerable communities
687.26	to tackle difficult, expensive
690.26	and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks,
693.26	and doing that with a local resource,
696.26	plenty available.
698.26	So something completely different
701.26	is to keep on challenging your perception
704.26	about the resources surrounding you,
707.26	whether they are environmental,
710.26	technological, animal, or human.
715.26	And to respectfully harmonize with them
718.26	in order to foster a sustainable world.
721.26	Thank you very much.
723.26	(Applause)
