12.95	Thousands of years from now,
15.088	we'll look back at the first
15.088	century of computing
18.96	as a fascinating but very peculiar time --
23.096	the only time in history where humans
23.096	were reduced to live in 2D space,
28.126	interacting with technology
28.126	as if we were machines;
32.069	a singular, 100-year period
32.069	in the vastness of time
37.31	where humans communicated,
40.022	were entertained and managed their lives
42.697	from behind a screen.
44.395	Today, we spend most of our time
44.395	tapping and looking at screens.
50.762	What happened to interacting
50.762	with each other?
55.04	I don't know about you, but I feel limited
57.735	inside this 2D world
57.735	of monitors and pixels.
61.751	And it is this very limitation
63.84	and my desire to connect with people
66.28	that inspires me as a creator.
68.292	Put simply: I want
68.292	to create a new reality,
71.667	a reality where technology brings
71.667	us infinitely closer to each other,
77.398	a reality where people, not devices,
80.612	are the center of everything.
82.998	I dream of a reality where technology
82.998	senses what we see, touch and feel;
89.724	a reality where technology
89.724	no longer gets in our way,
93.059	but instead embraces who we are.
96.328	I dream of technology
98.728	on a human path.
100.878	We have all experienced technology
102.91	that enables people
102.91	to act more like people,
106.236	products that enable natural interactions,
106.236	voice controls or biometrics.
115.476	This is the next step in the evolution.
119.33	This is Microsoft HoloLens,
121.309	the first fully untethered
121.309	holographic computer.
125.644	Devices like this will bring
125.644	3D holographic content
129.861	right into our world,
131.804	enhancing the way we experience life
133.885	beyond our ordinary range of perceptions.
137.233	Now, I'm not thinking
137.233	about a distant future.
141.844	I'm talking about today.
143.958	We are already seeing
143.958	car companies like Volvo
147.126	designing cars differently with HoloLens;
150.077	universities like Case Western
150.077	redefining the way medical students learn;
154.832	and my personal favorite,
156.744	NASA is using HoloLens
156.744	to let scientists explore planets
162.115	holographically.
163.932	Now, this is important.
166.194	By bringing holograms into our world,
168.66	I'm not just talking about a new device
168.66	or a better computer.
172.914	I'm talking about freeing ourselves
172.914	from the 2D confines
178.341	of traditional computing.
181.334	Put it this way:
182.961	temporally adjusted, we're like
182.961	cave people in computer terms.
187.878	We've barely discovered charcoal
189.816	and started drawing
189.816	the first stick figures in our cave.
194.925	Now, this is the perspective
194.925	I apply to my work every single day.
200.016	And now for the next few minutes,
201.991	I invite all of you to apply
201.991	the same perspective
206.314	to the journey ahead of us.
211.461	Now, as I put this HoloLens on,
214.405	let me explain the setup a little bit.
216.608	It's probably the most risky demo
216.608	we have ever done on any stage
222.004	with HoloLens,
223.262	and I can't think of a better place
223.262	to do it than here at TED.
227.221	Momentarily, I am going
227.221	to be seeing holograms
231.019	right on this stage,
232.365	just as clearly as I can see all of you.
234.645	Now at the same time,
234.645	we have also this special camera
238.307	that just walked in onstage
240.027	so that all of you can share
240.027	in this experience with me
243.283	up on all the monitors.
245.917	So let's start our journey.
247.296	And what better place
247.296	to begin our journey,
249.756	than in the computer cave of 2D.
254.978	Let's explore the world
254.978	all around us with this new lens,
259.193	and understand the computer world
259.193	from a brand new perspective.
263.673	The computer universe
263.673	is both marvelous and primitive.
268.933	It's a universe based on causality.
272.112	As developers, we dream
272.112	the different causes
275.304	and then we program the different effects.
278.084	Double click on an icon, that's a cause.
281.582	Open an application, that's an effect.
285.264	Now when we compare this
285.264	to our physical universe,
289.535	it is overly constraining,
291.574	because our universe is not digital.
294.747	Our universe is analog.
296.662	Our universe doesn't think
296.662	in terms of zero or one,
301.24	true or false, or black or white.
304.663	We exist in a world
304.663	governed by quantum physics,
308.933	a universe of zero and one
308.933	both at the same time,
313.88	a reality based on infinite
313.88	probabilities and shades of gray.
319.384	You can see how these two worlds collide.
323.975	So why are screens so pervasive
323.975	in our analog life?
330.366	We see screens from the moment we wake up,
332.991	to the moment we fall asleep.
335.174	Why?
336.666	I think it's because computers
336.666	give us superpowers.
340.393	Within the digital universe,
340.393	we have the power to displace space
344.123	and the power to displace time.
346.381	It doesn't matter if you're using
346.381	technology for entertainment,
349.741	productivity or communication.
352.7	Think of it this way:
353.885	let's all go home tonight
355.289	and watch our favorite show on television.
358.462	This is theater -- time
358.462	and space displaced.
362.634	As soon as I'm done with this TED Talk,
364.758	I'm going to immediately call
364.758	my lovely family in Seattle.
371.261	That's displacement of space.
374.088	Now, these are such great superpowers
376.335	that we put up with
376.335	the two-dimensional limitations
379.308	of our current digital world.
381.121	But what if we didn't have to?
383.18	What if we could have
383.18	these same digital powers
387.168	in our world?
389.966	You can already see glimmers of this,
392.386	but I believe our children's children
395.062	will grow up in a world
395.062	devoid of 2D technology.
400.079	It's remarkable to dream of this world,
402.518	a world where technology
402.518	truly understands us --
406.731	where we live, work and communicate --
409.285	with tools that enhance
409.285	the human experience,
412.971	not machines that limit our humanity.
418.642	So how do we get there?
421.182	For me, the answer required
421.182	looking at the problem
425.296	from a different perspective.
428.93	It required sensing the world
428.93	from the perspective of a machine.
434.429	If you're a machine trying
434.429	to sense our world,
438.055	how would you actually
438.055	break the problem down?
441.137	You'd probably try to classify things
443.856	as a human,
446.205	an environment
448.999	or an object.
451.973	But how would that machine
451.973	then interact with reality?
457.063	And I can think of three ways.
458.712	First, as a machine,
460.902	I would observe or I would input reality.
465.847	Speech recognition
465.847	and biometric authentication
468.553	are great examples of a machine
468.553	interacting with humans
471.837	from an input perspective.
474.481	Secondly, as a machine,
476.796	I could place digital information,
476.796	or output information,
481.931	into reality.
483.939	Holograms are examples of a machine
483.939	interacting with an environment
488.635	from an output perspective.
490.968	Finally, as a machine,
493.11	I could exchange energy
493.11	with the world via haptics.
497.8	Now, imagine being able to feel
497.8	the temperature of a virtual object,
502.416	or better yet, imagine pushing a hologram
505.659	and having it push you back
505.659	with equal force.
509.455	With this perspective,
511.186	we are able to collapse reality
511.186	into a simple matrix.
516.172	Now here's a secret:
517.347	as an engineer, I get really excited
519.429	anytime I can reduce
519.429	something to the matrix.
522.783	From self-driving cars
524.846	to smartphones
526.459	to this holographic computer on my head,
528.805	machines are becoming capable
528.805	of understanding our world.
533.293	And they are starting to interact with us
535.852	in significantly more personal ways.
540.197	Now, imagine having granular control
543.846	over everything in the world.
546.78	Move the dial one way,
550.93	and you get reality.
553.268	Move the dial the other way,
557.582	and you get virtual reality.
561.748	Now, imagine dialing
561.748	your entire environment
566.863	between virtual and real worlds.
574.462	I love it down here.
576.663	Now, imagine if I could look at all of you
580.154	and dial from real humans into elves.
584.76	When technology truly
584.76	understands our world,
587.548	it will again transform
587.548	the ways we interact,
591.219	the ways we work and the ways we play.
599.238	Less than half a century ago,
601.798	two courageous men landed on the moon,
604.696	using computers that were less powerful
604.696	than the phones in your pockets.
609.11	Six hundred million humans watched them
612.245	on grainy, black-and-white televisions.
615.579	And the world?
617.096	The world was mesmerized.
620.03	Now imagine how our children
620.03	and their children
624.986	will experience the continued
624.986	exploration of space
628.547	with technology
628.547	that understands this world.
633.355	We already live in a world where
633.355	real-time universal translators exist.
638.174	And I can squint, and I can already
638.174	see holographic telepresence
643.333	in our near future.
645.079	In fact, since we've been lucky
645.079	with our demo so far,
648.182	let's try doing something else
648.182	even more crazy.
651.153	I invite you to experience,
653.93	for the first time anywhere in the world,
656.991	here on the TED stage,
659.5	a real-life holographic teleportation,
663.953	between me and my friend,
663.953	Dr. Jeffrey Norris,
667.684	from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
670.506	Finger crossed. Hi, Jeff.
674.514	Jeff Norris: Hey, Alex.
675.704	Alex Kipman: Phew! That worked.
675.704	How are you doing today, Jeff?
678.831	(Applause)
680.958	JN: Doing great. I had an awesome week.
683.046	AK: So, can you tell us a little bit,
683.046	Jeff, about where you are?
688.197	JN: Well, I'm actually in three places.
691.222	I'm standing in a room across the street,
694.127	while I'm standing on this stage with you,
697.155	while I'm standing on Mars,
697.155	a hundred million miles away.
701.981	AK: Wow, a hundred million
701.981	miles away. This is crazy!
705.697	Can you tell us a little bit more
705.697	about where all this data
708.507	from Mars is coming from?
712.005	JN: Absolutely.
713.481	This is a precise
713.481	holographic replica of Mars,
717.591	built from data captured
717.591	by the Curiosity Mars Rover,
720.795	that I can explore as easily
720.795	as a place on Earth.
725.056	Humans are natural explorers.
728.334	We can instantly
728.334	understand an environment,
730.919	just by being present in it.
733.773	We've built tools like our Mars Rover
735.817	to extend our vision
735.817	and lengthen our reach.
739.441	But for decades,
741.576	we've explored from a seat
741.576	behind screens and keyboards.
746.779	Now, we're leaping over all of that,
749.652	over the giant antennas
749.652	and the relay satellites
752.879	and the vastness between worlds
755.178	to take our first steps on this landscape
755.178	as if we were truly there.
761.502	Today, a group of scientists
761.502	on our mission
764.114	are seeing Mars as never before --
767.522	an alien world made
767.522	a little more familiar,
770.863	because they're finally exploring it
770.863	as humans should.
775.225	But our dreams don't have to end
775.225	with making it just like being there.
779.935	When we dial this real world
779.935	to the virtual,
782.373	we can do magical things.
785.092	We can see in invisible wavelengths
787.507	or teleport to the top of a mountain.
790.882	Perhaps someday, we'll feel the minerals
790.882	in a rock just by touching it.
797.003	We're taking the first steps.
799.177	But we want the whole world
799.177	to join us in taking the next,
802.951	because this is not a journey for a few,
805.738	but for all of us.
808.36	AK: Thank you Jeff, this was amazing.
810.249	Thank you so much for joining us
810.249	on the TED stage today.
813.01	(Applause)
819.747	JN: Thank you Alex, bye bye.
822.483	AK: Bye, Jeff.
830.562	(Applause)
837.908	I dream about this future
841.145	every single day.
844.08	I take inspiration from our ancestors.
846.855	We used to live in tribes
846.855	where we interacted,
849.404	communicated and worked together.
852.509	We are all beginning to build technology
852.509	that will enable us to return
857.526	to the humanity that brought us
857.526	where we are today --
861.419	technology that will let us stop living
861.419	inside this 2D world
866.56	of monitors and pixels,
868.592	and let us start remembering
868.592	what it feels like
873.363	to live in our 3D world.
877.938	It's a phenomenal time to be human.
882.147	Thank you.
883.344	(Applause)
888.437	Helen Walters: Thanks so much.
888.437	I have some questions.
890.958	AK: OK.
892.133	HW: So there's been
892.133	some talk in the press.
894.579	And I'll just ask you straight,
894.579	then we have a straight answer.
897.629	There's been talk about the difference
897.629	between the demos
900.335	and the reality of the commercial product.
902.541	Talk about this field of view issue.
904.516	Is this type of experience what someone
904.516	who buys the product will get?
908.859	AK: It's a great question,
910.842	Or, said better, this is a question
910.842	we've been receiving
913.517	in the media for possibly the last year.
916.204	If you do your research,
916.204	I haven't answered that question.
918.975	I've purposely ignored it,
920.405	because ultimately,
920.405	it's the wrong question to ask.
923.535	That's the equivalent of me showing
923.535	holograms to someone for the first time,
929.983	and you then saying,
929.983	"""What's the size of your television?"""
933.817	The field of view for the product
933.817	is almost irrelevant.
936.535	What we should be talking about
936.535	is the density of lights,
940.057	or radiance, that shows up.
941.867	Better said, what the angular resolution
941.867	is of the things that you see.
945.262	So from that perspective, what you saw --
947.286	you know, the camera
947.286	is wearing a HoloLens.
949.373	So even if I wanted to cheat, I can't.
951.381	HW: But the camera has a different lens
951.381	on it than our eye. Right?
954.971	AK: The camera has a fish-eye lens on it.
957.915	It's seeing a much wider view
957.915	than the human eye is.
960.86	So if you think about the points of light
960.86	that show up radially
965.189	from the vision of the camera,
966.727	which is the thing that matters:
968.472	how many points of light
968.472	can I get in a given volume?
971.054	That's the same as I get
971.054	on this HoloLens as I will on that one.
975.205	Now, this camera sees
975.205	a much wider view of the world, right?
980.21	HW: Jesus Christ!
981.457	(Laughter)
982.482	AK: He did show up!
982.482	I told you he'd show up.
984.585	Come this way.
985.808	(Laughter)
987.696	HW: Oh, shit.
989.723	AK: And there's holographic Jeff Norris.
992.199	HW: I knew something was happening,
992.199	but I really wasn't sure what.
995.841	AK: So in short: to be super crisp,
997.612	the camera that you see on the screen
997.612	has a wider field of view
1000.652	than the human eye.
1001.874	But the angular resolution
1001.874	of the holograms that you see,
1005.105	the points of light per unit of area,
1009.098	are actually the same.
1010.288	HW: So you spent -- Jeff,
1010.288	I'll get to you in a minute --
1013.451	so you spent a lot of time
1013.451	mapping the stage --
1018.055	AK: That's right.
1019.429	HW: So help me out here:
1020.627	if I buy a HoloLens and have it at home,
1022.62	I don't need to map my apartment, right?
1024.581	AK: The HoloLens maps in real time
1024.581	at about five frames per second,
1028.718	with this technology
1028.718	that we call spatial mapping.
1031.143	So in your home, as soon as you put it on,
1033.194	holograms will start showing up,
1033.194	and you'll start placing them
1036.148	and they'll start learning your home.
1037.963	In a stage environment where we're trying
1037.963	to get something on my head
1041.496	to communicate with something over there
1043.671	with all of the wireless connectivity
1043.671	that usually brings all conferences down,
1047.666	we don't take the risk
1047.666	of trying to do this live.
1052.027	So what we do is pre-map the stage
1052.027	at five frames per second
1055.105	with the same spatial-mapping technology
1057.153	that you'll use with the product at home,
1059.164	and then we store it,
1060.339	so that when there's shenanigans
1060.339	of wireless in an environment like this,
1063.817	between the camera's HoloLens
1063.817	and the one on my head,
1066.858	we don't have things disappear.
1068.475	Because ultimately, the holograms
1068.475	are coming from this HoloLens,
1071.928	and that one is just viewing the HoloLens.
1073.992	So if I lose connectivity,
1075.941	you would stop seeing
1075.941	beautiful things on the screen.
1078.492	HW: And it was beautiful.
1080.079	Um ... Jeff?
1082.538	JN: Yes?
1084.367	HW: Hi.
1087.543	AK: I'll take a step back.
1088.818	HW: So Jeff, you were on Mars,
1091.772	you were here, you were
1091.772	in a room across the street.
1094.303	Tell me more about the fact that,
1094.303	with holograms, you have sight
1098.529	but you don't have touch,
1098.529	you don't have smell.
1101.254	Is this scientifically useful now?
1104.824	That's my question for a hologram.
1107.044	JN: Thanks for the question.
1108.864	Absolutely, I believe
1108.864	that these technologies
1111.401	are scientifically useful right now,
1113.449	and that's why we're using them
1113.449	in multiple parts of our work at NASA.
1118.077	So we're using it to improve
1118.077	the ways that we explore Mars.
1121.72	We're also using it for our astronauts
1121.72	on the space station.
1125.205	We're even using it now to design
1127.681	the next generation of our spacecraft.
1130.834	HW: Amazing. OK, Jeff, please go away.
1130.834	Thank you very much.
1133.892	(Laughter)
1136.125	Alex, really, that was amazing.
1136.125	Thank you so much.
1139.636	AK: Thank you.
1140.818	HW: Thank you. Thank you.
1142.103	(Applause)
