12.834	So my moment of truth
14.872	did not come all at once.
17.936	In 2010, I had the chance to be considered
21.562	for promotion from my job
23.889	as director of policy planning
25.961	at the U.S. State Department.
28.718	This was my moment to lean in,
32.449	to push myself forward
35.334	for what are really only a handful
38.028	of the very top foreign policy jobs,
41.045	and I had just finished a big, 18-month project
44.125	for Secretary Clinton, successfully,
46.698	and I knew I could handle a bigger job.
50.929	The woman I thought I was
54.759	would have said yes.
56.93	But I had been commuting for two years
58.957	between Washington and Princeton, New Jersey,
62.1	where my husband and my two teenage sons lived,
66.027	and it was not going well.
69.293	I tried on the idea of eking out another two years
72.998	in Washington, or maybe uprooting my sons
75.794	from their school and my husband from his work
77.929	and asking them to join me.
80.51	But deep down, I knew
83.549	that the right decision was to go home,
87.08	even if I didn't fully recognize the woman
89.996	who was making that choice.
93.988	That was a decision based on love
97.495	and responsibility.
99.439	I couldn't keep watching my oldest son
102.338	make bad choices
103.763	without being able to be there for him
106.458	when and if he needed me.
110.241	But the real change came more gradually.
113.755	Over the next year,
115.514	while my family was righting itself,
118.389	I started to realize
120.053	that even if I could go back into government,
122.992	I didn't want to.
124.772	I didn't want to miss the last five years
128.719	that my sons were at home.
131.551	I finally allowed myself to accept
135.437	what was really most important to me,
138.443	not what I was conditioned to want
141.852	or maybe what I conditioned myself to want,
146.55	and that decision led to a reassessment
151.611	of the feminist narrative that I grew up with
154.634	and have always championed.
158.29	I am still completely committed
162.142	to the cause of male-female equality,
167.327	but let's think about what that equality really means,
172.273	and how best to achieve it.
175.2	I always accepted the idea
178.323	that the most respected and powerful people
181.248	in our society are men at the top of their careers,
185.753	so that the measure of male-female equality
189.928	ought to be how many women are in those positions:
194.147	prime ministers, presidents, CEOs,
197.066	directors, managers, Nobel laureates, leaders.
202.169	I still think we should do everything we possibly can
206.446	to achieve that goal.
208.526	But that's only half of real equality,
213.651	and I now think we're never going to get there
216.999	unless we recognize the other half.
222.281	I suggest that real equality,
226.592	full equality,
228.863	does not just mean valuing women
232.078	on male terms.
234.245	It means creating a much wider range
238.863	of equally respected choices
242.875	for women and for men.
245.926	And to get there, we have to change our workplaces,
249.395	our policies and our culture.
252.309	In the workplace,
254.374	real equality means valuing family
257.677	just as much as work,
259.3	and understanding that the two reinforce each other.
263.863	As a leader and as a manager,
265.766	I have always acted on the mantra,
268.811	if family comes first,
271.091	work does not come second --
273.938	life comes together.
276.242	If you work for me, and you have a family issue,
280.407	I expect you to attend to it,
282.841	and I am confident,
284.486	and my confidence has always been borne out,
287.183	that the work will get done, and done better.
291.174	Workers who have a reason to get home
293.575	to care for their children or their family members
296.954	are more focused, more efficient,
299.461	more results-focused.
301.484	And breadwinners who are also caregivers
304.613	have a much wider range
307.22	of experiences and contacts.
309.746	Think about a lawyer who spends part of his time
312.978	at school events for his kids
315.579	talking to other parents.
317.405	He's much more likely to bring in
319.463	new clients for his firm
321.403	than a lawyer who never leaves his office.
324.664	And caregiving itself
326.553	develops patience --
330.335	a lot of patience --
332.798	and empathy, creativity, resilience, adaptability.
338.418	Those are all attributes that are ever more important
342.216	in a high-speed, horizontal,
344.309	networked global economy.
348.758	The best companies actually know this.
351.946	The companies that win awards
353.673	for workplace flexibility in the United States
356.925	include some of our most successful corporations,
360.151	and a 2008 national study
362.422	on the changing workforce
364.475	showed that employees
366.089	in flexible and effective workplaces
369.591	are more engaged with their work,
371.304	they're more satisfied and more loyal,
373.794	they have lower levels of stress
375.627	and higher levels of mental health.
378.026	And a 2012 study of employers
381.736	showed that deep, flexible practices
384.589	actually lowered operating costs
386.979	and increased adaptability
389.444	in a global service economy.
392.531	So you may think
395.648	that the privileging of work over family
399.865	is only an American problem.
403.812	Sadly, though, the obsession with work
407.35	is no longer a uniquely American disease.
410.51	Twenty years ago,
412.282	when my family first started going to Italy,
414.278	we used to luxuriate in the culture of siesta.
417.881	Siesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day.
420.764	It's actually just as much
422.63	about embracing the warmth of a family lunch.
425.742	Now, when we go, fewer and fewer businesses
428.945	close for siesta,
430.658	reflecting the advance of global corporations
434.196	and 24-hour competition.
437.033	So making a place for those we love
439.902	is actually a global imperative.
443.647	In policy terms,
446.377	real equality means recognizing
449.813	that the work that women have traditionally done
452.771	is just as important
454.648	as the work that men have traditionally done,
457.311	no matter who does it.
460.363	Think about it: Breadwinning and caregiving
464.108	are equally necessary for human survival.
467.633	At least if we get beyond a barter economy,
471.117	somebody has to earn an income
473.354	and someone else has to convert that income
476.308	to care and sustenance for loved ones.
480.092	Now most of you, when you hear me
482.23	talk about breadwinning and caregiving,
484.955	instinctively translate those categories
488.396	into men's work and women's work.
492.127	And we don't typically challenge
494.963	why men's work is advantaged.
498.861	But consider a same-sex couple
501.451	like my friends Sarah and Emily.
503.47	They're psychiatrists.
505.338	They got married five years ago,
507.167	and now they have two-year-old twins.
510.448	They love being mothers,
512.52	but they also love their work,
514.088	and they're really good at what they do.
516.298	So how are they going to divide up
518.319	breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities?
520.796	Should one of them stop working
522.881	or reduce hours to be home?
525.573	Or should they both change their practices
528.252	so they can have much more flexible schedules?
531.535	And what criteria should they use
533.506	to make that decision?
534.8	Is it who makes the most money
536.574	or who is most committed to her career?
540.351	Or who has the most flexible boss?
544.912	The same-sex perspective helps us see
548.237	that juggling work and family
550.701	are not women's problems,
552.812	they're family problems.
555.45	And Sarah and Emily are the lucky ones,
558.473	because they have a choice
560.242	about how much they want to work.
562.779	Millions of men and women
565.608	have to be both breadwinners and caregivers
568.945	just to earn the income they need,
572.485	and many of those workers are scrambling.
575.033	They're patching together care arrangements
577.917	that are inadequate
579.09	and often actually unsafe.
581.501	If breadwinning and caregiving are really equal,
586.191	then why shouldn't a government
587.779	invest as much in an infrastructure of care
591.595	as the foundation of a healthy society
595.454	as it invests in physical infrastructure
598.566	as the backbone of a successful economy?
602.442	The governments that get it --
604.778	no surprises here --
606.625	the governments that get it,
608.465	Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands,
613.17	provide universal child care,
616.1	support for caregivers at home,
618.219	school and early childhood education,
621.386	protections for pregnant women,
623.596	and care for the elderly and the disabled.
627.981	Those governments invest in that infrastructure
631.662	the same way they invest in roads and bridges
634.991	and tunnels and trains.
638.126	Those societies also show you
640.534	that breadwinning and caregiving
642.824	reinforce each other.
645.208	They routinely rank among the top 15 countries
651.047	of the most globally competitive economies,
654.38	but at the same time,
656.032	they rank very high on the OECD Better Life Index.
660.723	In fact, they rank higher than other governments,
664.259	like my own, the U.S., or Switzerland,
666.928	that have higher average levels of income
669.857	but lower rankings on work-life balance.
675.62	So changing our workplaces
678.296	and building infrastructures of care
681.592	would make a big difference,
683.067	but we're not going to get equally valued choices
687.551	unless we change our culture,
690.056	and the kind of cultural change required
693.197	means re-socializing men.
695.952	(Applause)
699.626	Increasingly in developed countries,
701.361	women are socialized to believe that our place
704.443	is no longer only in the home,
708.103	but men are actually still where they always were.
712.999	Men are still socialized to believe
716.397	that they have to be breadwinners,
718.652	that to derive their self-worth
721.527	from how high they can climb over other men
724.406	on a career ladder.
726.751	The feminist revolution still has a long way to go.
729.534	It's certainly not complete.
731.436	But 60 years after
733.092	"""The Feminine"
733.092	"Mystique"" was published,"
735.402	many women actually have
737.703	more choices than men do.
740.681	We can decide to be a breadwinner,
743.409	a caregiver, or any combination of the two.
747.556	When a man, on the other hand,
750.082	decides to be a caregiver,
752.971	he puts his manhood on the line.
756.275	His friends may praise his decision,
759.495	but underneath, they're scratching their heads.
763.367	Isn't the measure of a man
766.468	his willingness to compete with other men
769.399	for power and prestige?
771.779	And as many women hold that view as men do.
775.875	We know that lots of women
778.841	still judge the attractiveness of a man
782.16	based in large part on how successful he is
784.885	in his career.
786.382	A woman can drop out of the work force
788.733	and still be an attractive partner.
790.893	For a man, that's a risky proposition.
795.432	So as parents and partners,
797.673	we should be socializing our sons
800.86	and our husbands
803.311	to be whatever they want to be,
806.635	either caregivers or breadwinners.
810.254	We should be socializing them to make caregiving
813.61	cool for guys.
815.597	(Applause)
819.362	"I can almost hear lots of you thinking, ""No way."""
825.674	But in fact, the change is 
825.674	actually already happening.
830.321	At least in the United States,
832.278	lots of men take pride in cooking,
834.502	and frankly obsess over stoves.
837.818	They are in the birthing rooms.
840.805	They take paternity leave when they can.
843.449	They can walk a baby or soothe a toddler
845.911	just as well as their wives can,
848.553	and they are increasingly
850.302	doing much more of the housework.
852.869	Indeed, there are male college students now
854.957	who are starting to say,
856.484	"""I want to be a stay-at-home dad."""
858.36	That was completely unthinkable
863.478	And in Norway, where men have
866.369	an automatic three month's paternity leave,
869.158	but they lose it if they decide not to take it,
872.495	a high government official told me
874.42	that companies are starting to look
876.652	at prospective male employees
878.737	and raise an eyebrow if they didn't in fact
882.715	take their leave when they had kids.
885.111	That means that it's starting to seem
887.94	like a character defect
890.142	not to want to be a fully engaged father.
897.421	So I was raised
902.943	to believe that championing women's rights
906.592	meant doing everything we could
908.711	to get women to the top.
910.485	And I still hope that I live long enough
913.204	to see men and women equally represented
916.467	at all levels of the work force.
919.514	But I've come to believe that we have to value family
923.613	every bit as much as we value work,
926.445	and that we should entertain the idea
928.957	that doing right by those we love
932.506	will make all of us better at everything we do.
936.422	Thirty years ago, Carol Gilligan,
938.49	a wonderful psychologist, studied adolescent girls
941.447	and identified an ethic of care,
944.504	an element of human nature every bit as important
947.659	as the ethic of justice.
949.646	"It turns out that ""you don't care"""
952.951	is just as much a part of who we are
955.872	"as ""that's not fair."""
958.152	Bill Gates agrees.
959.952	He argues that the two great forces of human nature
963.123	are self-interest and caring for others.
967.33	Let's bring them both together.
969.972	Let's make the feminist revolution
972.631	a humanist revolution.
975.363	As whole human beings,
977.107	we will be better caregivers and breadwinners.
980.951	You may think that can't happen,
983.059	but I grew up in a society
984.759	where my mother put out small vases
987.105	of cigarettes for dinner parties,
989.767	where blacks and whites used separate bathrooms,
993.96	and where everybody claimed to be heterosexual.
1000.602	Today, not so much.
1005.041	The revolution for human equality
1008.681	can happen.
1010.471	It is happening.
1012.717	It will happen.
1014.999	How far and how fast is up to us.
1019.717	Thank you.
1021.86	(Applause)
