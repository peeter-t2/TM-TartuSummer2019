12.316	What I want you all to do right now
14.838	is to think of this mammal that I'm going to describe to you.
19.029	The first thing I'm going to tell you about this mammal
21.877	is that it is essential for our ecosystems to function correctly.
26.205	If we remove this mammal from our ecosystems,
29.267	they simply will not work.
32.339	That's the first thing.
34.029	The second thing is that due to the unique sensory abilities
38.706	of this mammal, if we study this mammal,
42.86	we're going to get great insight into our diseases
46.422	of the senses, such as blindness and deafness.
50.958	And the third really intriguing aspect of this mammal
55.728	is that I fully believe that the secret of everlasting youth
60.922	lies deep within its DNA.
64.977	So are you all thinking?
67.285	So,
69.779	magnificent creature, isn't it?
72.881	Who here thought of a bat?
76.233	Ah, I can see half the audience agrees with me,
78.864	and I have a lot of work to do to convince the rest of you.
82.087	So I have had the good fortune for the past 20 years
86.345	to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals.
90.744	One fifth of all living mammals is a bat,
94.506	and they have very unique attributes.
96.918	Bats as we know them have been around on this planet
99.946	for about 64 million years.
103.929	One of the most unique things that bats do
107.394	as a mammal is that they fly.
110.195	Now flight is an inherently difficult thing.
113.53	Flight within vertebrates has only evolved three times:
117.473	once in the bats, once in the birds,
120.833	and once in the pterodactyls.
122.928	And so with flight, it's very metabolically costly.
126.774	Bats have learned and evolved how to deal with this.
130.704	But one other extremely unique thing about bats
135.09	is that they are able to use sound
137.139	to perceive their environment. They use echolocation.
141.935	Now, what I mean by echolocation --
144.599	they emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth
148.104	or through their nose. This sound wave comes out
152	and it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment,
156.087	and the bats then hear these echoes
158.947	and they turn this information into an acoustic image.
162.465	And this enables them to orient in complete darkness.
167.093	Indeed, they do look very strange. We're humans.
170.518	We're a visual species. When scientists first realized
173.713	that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly
177.654	and orient and move at night, we didn't believe it.
180.629	For a hundred years, despite evidence to show
183.653	that this is what they were doing, we didn't believe it.
186.892	Now, if you look at this bat, it looks a little bit alien.
190.86	Indeed, the very famous philosopher Thomas Nagel
194.158	"once said, ""To truly experience an alien life form"
197.663	on this planet, you should lock yourself inside a room
201.403	"with a flying, echolocating bat in complete darkness."""
205.528	And if you look at the actual physical characteristics
208.599	on the face of this beautiful horseshoe bat,
211.556	you see a lot of these characteristics are dedicated
214.35	to be able to make sound and perceive it.
217.689	Very big ears, strange nose leaves, but teeny-tiny eyes.
222.253	So again, if you just look at this bat, you realize
226.142	sound is very important for its survival.
229.416	Most bats look like the previous one.
233.785	However, there are a group that do not use echolocation.
237.824	They do not perceive their environment using sound,
240.823	and these are the flying foxes.
242.569	If anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in Australia,
245.839	you've seen them coming out of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney,
249.064	and if you just look at their face, you can see
252.249	they have much, much larger eyes and much smaller ears.
255.787	So among and within bats is a huge variation
259.309	in their ability to use sensory perception.
262.2	Now this is going to be important for what I'm going
264.253	to tell you later during the talk.
266.016	Now, if the idea of bats in your belfry terrifies you,
271.095	and I know some people probably are feeling a little sick
273.964	looking at very large images of bats,
277.168	that's probably not that surprising,
280.057	because here in Western culture,
282.384	bats have been demonized.
284.141	"Really, of course the famous book ""Dracula,"""
286.805	written by a fellow Northside Dubliner Bram Stoker,
289.888	probably is mainly responsible for this.
291.945	However, I also think it's got to do with the fact
295.025	that bats come out at night, and we don't
297.308	really understand them. We're a little frightened by things
299.96	that can perceive the world slightly differently than us.
303.26	Bats are usually synonymous with some type of evil events.
306.319	They are the perpetrators in horror movies,
309.184	"such as this famous ""Nightwing."""
310.991	Also, if you think about it, demons
313.752	always have bat wings, whereas birds, they typically --
317.467	or angels have bird wings.
320.336	Now, this is Western society, and what I hope to do tonight
325.445	is to convince you of the Chinese traditional culture,
330.144	that they perceive bats as
333.073	creatures that bring good luck, and indeed, if you walk
336.657	into a Chinese home, you may see an image such as this.
341.001	This is considered the Five Blessings.
343.183	"The Chinese word for ""bat"" sounds like the Chinese word"
345.845	"for ""happiness,"" and they believe that bats"
348.936	bring wealth, health, longevity, virtue and serenity.
353.297	And indeed, in this image, you have a picture of longevity
356.657	surrounded by five bats.
358.755	And what I want to do tonight is to talk to you
362.438	and to show you that at least three of these blessings
366.024	are definitely represented by a bat, and that if we study bats
369.393	we will get nearer to getting each of these blessings.
373.656	So, wealth -- how can a bat possibly bring us wealth?
378.707	Now as I said before, bats are essential for our ecosystems
382.217	to function correctly. And why is this?
385.889	Bats in the tropics are major pollinators of many plants.
390.003	They also feed on fruit, and they disperse the seeds
392.995	of these fruits. Bats are responsible for pollinating
397.103	the tequila plant, and this is a multi-million dollar industry
400.756	in Mexico. So indeed, we need them
403.717	for our ecosystems to function properly.
406.109	Without them, it's going to be a problem.
408.844	But most bats are voracious insect predators.
414.366	It's been estimated in the U.S., in a tiny colony
417.242	of big brown bats, that they will feed
419.393	on over a million insects a year,
422.963	and in the United States of America, right now
425.906	bats are being threatened by a disease known as white-nose syndrome.
429.247	It's working its way slowly across the U.S. and wiping out
432.487	populations of bats, and scientists have estimated
436.247	that 1,300 metric tons of insects a year are now
441.204	remaining in the ecosystems due to the loss of bats.
444.918	Bats are also threatened in the U.S.
447.33	by their attraction to wind farms. Again, right now
451.169	bats are looking at a little bit of a problem.
452.893	They're going to -- They are very threatened
455.191	in the United States of America alone.
458.736	Now how can this help us?
460.277	Well, it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats
463.942	from the equation, we're going to have to then use
466.336	insecticides to remove all those pest insects
469.277	that feed on our agricultural crops.
472.352	And for one year in the U.S. alone, it's estimated
476	that it's going to cost 22 billion U.S. dollars,
478.942	if we remove bats. So indeed, bats then do bring us wealth.
483.465	They maintain the health of our ecosystems,
485.921	and also they save us money.
488.41	So again, that's the first blessing. Bats are important
491.297	for our ecosystems.
493.953	And what about the second? What about health?
497.953	Inside every cell in your body lies your genome.
502.615	Your genome is made up of your DNA,
505.265	your DNA codes for proteins that enable you to function
508.457	and interact and be as you are.
511.377	Now since the new advancements in modern molecular technologies,
515.839	it is now possible for us to sequence our own genome
519.962	in a very rapid time and at a very, very reduced cost.
524.091	Now when we've been doing this, we've realized
526.631	that there's variations within our genome.
530.448	So I want you to look at the person beside you.
533.642	Just have a quick look. And what we need to realize
535.721	is that every 300 base pairs in your DNA, you're a little bit different.
540.365	And one of the grand challenges right now
542.63	in modern molecular medicine is to work out
545.226	whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases,
550.068	or does this variation just make you different?
552.979	Again, what does it mean here? What does this variation
555.385	actually mean? So if we are to capitalize on all of this
559.204	new molecular data and personalized genomic information
563.098	that is coming online that we will be able to have
565.499	in the next few years, we have to be able to differentiate
568.571	between the two. So how do we do this?
571.787	Well, I believe we just look at nature's experiments.
575.115	So through natural selection, over time,
579.96	mutations, variations that disrupt the function of a protein
585.077	will not be tolerated over time.
587.698	Evolution acts as a sieve. It sieves out the bad variation.
591.892	And so therefore, if you look at the same region
594.153	of a genome in many mammals that have been
597.304	evolutionarily distant from each other
600.808	and are also ecologically divergent, you will get a better
604.271	understanding of what the evolutionary prior of that site is,
608.033	i.e., if it is important for the mammal to function,
611.912	for its survival, it will be the same
614.232	in all of those different lineages, species, taxa.
618.983	So therefore, if we were to do this,
622.26	what we'd need to do is sequence that region
623.729	in all these different mammals and ascertain if it's the same
626.844	or if it's different. So if it is the same,
630.851	this indicates that that site is important for a function,
633.96	so a disease mutation should fall within that site.
637.823	So in this case here, if all the mammals that we look at
641.56	have a yellow-type genome at that site,
644.824	it probably suggests that purple is bad.
647.486	This could be even more powerful if you look at mammals
650.96	that are doing things slightly differently.
653.632	So say, for example, the region of the genome
655.71	that I was looking at was a region that's important for vision.
659.239	If we look at that region in mammals that don't see so well,
662.913	such as bats, and we find that bats that don't see so well
666.747	have the purple type, we know that this is probably
669.519	what's causing this disease.
672.894	So in my lab, we've been using bats to look at two different
677.087	types of diseases of the senses.
680.435	We're looking at blindness. Now why would you do this?
683.243	Three hundred and fourteen million people are visually impaired, and
691.78	and a lot of these blind disorders come from inherited diseases,
695.995	so we want to try and better understand
698.166	which mutations in the gene cause the disease.
701.771	Also we look at deafness. One in every 1,000
705.679	newborn babies are deaf, and when we reach 80,
709.195	over half of us will also have a hearing problem.
712.253	Again, there's many underlying genetic causes for this.
716.53	So what we've been doing in my lab
719.177	is looking at these unique sensory specialists, the bats,
722.291	and we have looked at genes that cause blindness
724.839	when there's a defect in them,
726.188	genes that cause deafness when there's a defect in them,
728.731	and now we can predict which sites are most likely to cause disease.
733.721	So bats are also important for our health,
736.602	to enable us to better understand how our genome functions.
741.492	So this is where we are right now,
743.911	but what about the future?
745.811	What about longevity?
747.467	This is where we're going to go, and as I said before,
751.208	I really believe that the secret of everlasting youth
754.287	lies within the bat genome.
755.996	So why should we be interested in aging at all?
760.112	Well, really, this is a picture drawn from the 1500s
762.6	of the Fountain of Youth. Aging is considered
766.416	one of the most familiar, yet the least well-understood,
770.051	aspects of all of biology, and really,
773.013	since the dawn of civilization, mankind has sought to avoid it.
777.389	But we are going to have to understand it a bit better.
780.434	In Europe alone, by 2050, there is going to be
784.063	a 70 percent increase of individuals over 65,
787.878	and 170 percent increase in individuals over 80.
791.615	As we age, we deteriorate, and this deterioration
794.456	causes problems for our society, so we have to address it.
799.218	So how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie
803.732	within the bat genome? Does anybody want to hazard
806.413	a guess over how long this bat could live for?
810.371	Who -- put up your hands -- who says two years?
813.396	Nobody? One? How about 10 years?
817.292	Some? How about 30?
821.144	How about 40? Okay, it's a whole varied response.
825.019	This bat is myotis brandtii. It's the longest-living bat.
828.67	It lived for up to 42 years,
830.858	and this bat's still alive in the wild today.
833.193	But what would be so amazing about this?
835.775	Well, typically, in mammals there is a relationship
840.857	between body size, metabolic rate,
843.357	and how long you can live for, and you can predict
845.493	how long a mammal can live for given its body size.
848.72	So typically, small mammals live fast, die young.
852.415	Think of a mouse. But bats are very different.
855.154	As you can see here on this graph, in blue,
857.97	these are all other mammals, but bats
860.536	can live up to nine times longer than expected
862.704	despite having a really, really high metabolic rate,
865.846	and the question is, how can they do that?
868.481	There are 19 species of mammal that live longer
872.022	than expected, given their body size, than man,
874.798	and 18 of those are bats.
877.646	So therefore, they must have something within their DNA
882.582	that ables them to deal with the metabolic stresses,
885.427	particularly of flight. They expend three times more energy
889.333	than a mammal of the same size,
890.873	but don't seem to suffer the consequences or the effects.
894.485	So right now, in my lab, we're combining
897.83	state-of-the-art bat field biology, going out and catching
901.741	the long-lived bats, with the most up-to-date,
904.55	modern molecular technology to understand better
908.021	what it is that they do to stop aging as we do.
912.549	And hopefully in the next five years, I'll be giving you a TEDTalk on that.
915.709	Aging is a big problem for humanity,
919.308	and I believe that by studying bats, we can uncover
922.244	the molecular mechanisms that enable mammals
925.116	to achieve extraordinary longevity. If we find out
928.325	what they're doing, perhaps through gene therapy,
931.557	we can enable us to do the same thing.
934.116	Potentially, this means that we could halt aging or maybe even reverse it.
939.392	Just imagine what that would be like.
943.283	So really, I don't think we should be thinking of them
946.168	as flying demons of the night, but more as our superheroes.
951.222	And the reality is that bats can bring us so much benefit
955.068	if we just look in the right place. They're good for our ecosystem,
957.62	they allow us to understand how our genome functions,
960.526	and they potentially hold the secret to everlasting youth.
963.755	So tonight, when you walk out of here and you look up
966.37	in the night skies, and you see this beautiful flying mammal,
969.869	I want you to smile. Thank you. (Applause)
