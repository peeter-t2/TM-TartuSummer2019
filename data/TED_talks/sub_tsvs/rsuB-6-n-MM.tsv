16.26	Why can't we solve these problems?
21.26	We know what they are.
24.26	Something always seems to stop us.
28.26	Why?
31.26	I remember March the 15th, 2000.
35.26	The B15 iceberg broke off the Ross Ice Shelf.
39.26	In the newspaper it said
42.26	"""it was all part of a normal process."""
45.26	A little bit further on in the article
48.26	"it said ""a loss that would normally take"
51.26	"the ice shelf 50-100 years to replace."""
58.26	"That same word, ""normal,"""
61.26	had two different,
63.26	almost opposite meanings.
66.26	If we walk into the B15 iceberg
69.26	when we leave here today,
72.26	we're going to bump into something
75.26	a thousand feet tall,
84.26	and it's going to weigh two gigatons.
87.26	I'm sorry, there's nothing normal about this.
90.26	And yet I think it's this perspective of us
93.26	as humans to look at our world
96.26	through the lens of normal
98.26	is one of the forces
100.26	that stops us developing real solutions.
106.26	Only 90 days after this,
109.26	arguably the greatest discovery
111.26	of the last century occurred.
113.26	It was the sequencing for the first time
115.26	of the human genome.
118.26	This is the code that's in every single one
122.26	of our 50 trillion cells
124.26	that makes us who we are and what we are.
128.26	And if we just take one cell's worth
130.26	of this code and unwind it,
135.26	it's a meter long,
139.26	two nanometers thick.
141.26	Two nanometers is 20 atoms in thickness.
145.26	And I wondered,
147.26	what if the answer to some of our biggest problems
150.26	could be found in the smallest of places,
153.26	where the difference between what is
155.26	valuable and what is worthless
157.26	is merely the addition or subtraction
159.26	of a few atoms?
161.26	And what
163.26	if we could get exquisite control
166.26	over the essence of energy,
168.26	the electron?
171.26	So I started to go around the world
173.26	finding the best and brightest scientists
175.26	I could at universities
177.26	whose collective discoveries have the chance
179.26	to take us there,
181.26	and we formed a company to build
183.26	on their extraordinary ideas.
185.26	Six and a half years later,
187.26	a hundred and eighty researchers,
189.26	they have some amazing developments
191.26	in the lab,
193.26	and I will show you three of those today,
195.26	such that we can stop burning up our planet
198.26	and instead,
200.26	we can generate all the energy we need
203.26	right where we are,
205.26	cleanly, safely, and cheaply.
208.26	Think of the space that we spend
210.26	most of our time.
212.26	A tremendous amount of energy
214.26	is coming at us from the sun.
216.26	We like the light that comes into the room,
218.26	but in the middle of summer,
220.26	all that heat is coming into the room
222.26	that we're trying to keep cool.
224.26	In winter, exactly the opposite is happening.
226.26	We're trying to heat up
227.26	the space that we're in,
229.26	and all that is trying to get out through the window.
231.26	Wouldn't it be really great
235.26	if the window could flick back the heat
237.26	into the room if we needed it
239.26	or flick it away before it came in?
241.26	One of the materials that can do this
243.26	is a remarkable material, carbon,
248.26	that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction
251.26	where graphite is blasted by a vapor,
256.26	and when the vaporized carbon condenses,
260.26	it condenses back into a different form:
263.26	chickenwire rolled up.
266.26	But this chickenwire carbon,
268.26	called a carbon nanotube,
270.26	is a hundred thousand times smaller
272.26	than the width of one of your hairs.
275.26	It's a thousand times
277.26	more conductive than copper.
280.26	How is that possible?
285.26	One of the things about working at the nanoscale
289.26	is things look and act very differently.
292.26	You think of carbon as black.
298.26	Carbon at the nanoscale
301.26	is actually transparent
304.26	and flexible.
309.26	And when it's in this form,
311.26	if I combine it with a polymer
314.26	and affix it to your window
317.26	when it's in its colored state,
320.26	it will reflect away all heat and light,
323.26	and when it's in its bleached state
325.26	it will let all the light and heat through
328.26	and any combination in between.
331.26	To change its state, by the way,
334.26	takes two volts from a millisecond pulse.
337.26	And once you've changed its state, it stays there
340.26	until you change its state again.
343.26	As we were working on this incredible
345.26	discovery at University of Florida,
347.26	we were told to go down the corridor
350.26	to visit another scientist,
352.26	and he was working
354.26	on a pretty incredible thing.
356.26	Imagine
358.26	if we didn't have to rely
360.26	on artificial lighting to get around at night.
366.26	We'd have to see at night, right?
372.26	This lets you do it.
374.26	It's a nanomaterial, two nanomaterials,
377.26	a detector and an imager.
380.26	The total width of it
382.26	is 600 times smaller
384.26	than the width of a decimal place.
387.26	And it takes all the infrared available at night,
391.26	converts it into an electron
394.26	in the space of two small films,
397.26	and is enabling you to play an image
400.26	which you can see through.
407.26	I'm going to show to TEDsters,
410.26	the first time, this operating.
412.26	Firstly I'm going to show you
414.26	the transparency.
417.26	Transparency is key.
421.26	It's a film that you can look through.
424.26	And then I'm going to turn the lights out.
427.26	And you can see, off a tiny film,
430.26	incredible clarity.
434.26	As we were working on this, it dawned on us:
438.26	this is taking infrared radiation, wavelengths,
442.26	and converting it into electrons.
445.26	What if we combined it
451.26	with this?
454.26	Suddenly you've converted energy
457.26	into an electron on a plastic surface
461.26	that you can stick on your window.
464.26	But because it's flexible,
466.26	it can be on any surface whatsoever.
470.26	The power plant of tomorrow
473.26	is no power plant.
480.26	We talked about generating and using.
483.26	We want to talk about storing energy,
485.26	and unfortunately
487.26	the best thing we've got going
489.26	is something that was developed in France
491.26	a hundred and fifty years ago,
493.26	the lead acid battery.
495.26	In terms of dollars per what's stored,
497.26	it's simply the best.
499.26	Knowing that we're not going to put fifty of
501.26	these in our basements to store our power,
503.26	we went to a group at University of Texas at Dallas,
505.26	and we gave them this diagram.
507.26	It was in actually a diner
509.26	outside of Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.
511.26	"We said, ""Could you build this?"""
513.26	And these scientists,
515.26	"instead of laughing at us, said, ""Yeah."""
517.26	And what they built was eBox.
520.26	EBox is testing new nanomaterials
522.26	to park an electron on the outside,
525.26	hold it until you need it,
528.26	and then be able to release it and pass it off.
531.26	Being able to do that means
535.26	that I can generate energy
538.26	cleanly, efficiently and cheaply
541.26	right where I am.
543.26	It's my energy.
546.26	And if I don't need it, I can convert it
548.26	back up on the window
550.26	to energy, light, and beam it,
552.26	line of site, to your place.
555.26	And for that I do not need
558.26	an electric grid between us.
561.26	The grid of tomorrow is no grid,
565.26	and energy, clean efficient energy,
569.26	will one day be free.
576.26	If you do this, you get the last puzzle piece,
580.26	which is water.
586.26	Each of us, every day,
591.26	need just eight glasses of this,
596.26	because we're human.
599.26	When we run out of water,
601.26	as we are in some parts of the world
603.26	and soon to be in other parts of the world,
605.26	we're going to have to get this from the sea,
608.26	and that's going to require us to build desalination plants.
614.26	These also require tremendous amounts of energy.
616.26	In fact, it's going to require twice the world's
618.26	supply of oil to run the pumps
620.26	to generate the water.
623.26	We're simply not going to do that.
625.26	But in a world where energy is freed
627.26	and transmittable
629.26	easily and cheaply, we can take any water
631.26	wherever we are
633.26	and turn it into whatever we need.
637.26	I'm glad to be working with
639.26	incredibly brilliant and kind scientists,
641.26	no kinder than
643.26	many of the people in the world,
645.26	but they have a magic look at the world.
648.26	And I'm glad to see their discoveries
650.26	coming out of the lab and into the world.
653.26	It's been a long time in coming for me.
660.26	I saw a photograph in the paper.
664.26	It was taken by Kevin Carter
666.26	who went to the Sudan
668.26	to document their famine there.
670.26	I've carried this photograph with me
672.26	every day since then.
677.26	It's a picture of a little girl dying of thirst.
687.26	By any standard this is wrong.
692.26	It's just wrong.
698.26	We can do better than this.
701.26	We should do better than this.
704.26	And whenever I go round
706.26	to somebody who says,
708.26	"""You know what, you're working on something that's too difficult."
710.26	It'll never happen. You don't have enough money.
713.26	You don't have enough time.
716.26	"There's something much more interesting around the corner,"""
719.26	"I say, ""Try saying that to her."""
721.26	That's what I say in my mind. And I just say
723.26	"""thank you,"" and I go on to the next one."
726.26	This is why we have to solve our problems,
729.26	and I know the answer as to how
734.26	is to be able to get exquisite control
738.26	over a building block of nature,
741.26	the stuff of life:
743.26	the simple electron.
745.26	Thank you.
747.26	(Applause)
