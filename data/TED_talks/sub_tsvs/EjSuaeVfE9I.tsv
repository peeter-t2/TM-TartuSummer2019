15.273	Over the past six months, I've spent my time
19.116	traveling. I think I've done 60,000 miles,
22.507	but without leaving my desk.
25.429	And the reason I can do that is because I'm actually two people.
28.275	I look like one person but I'm two people. I'm Eddie who is here,
31.228	and at the same time, my alter ego is a big green boxy
35.629	avatar nicknamed Cyber Frank.
39.309	So that's what I spend my time doing. I'd like to start,
42.118	if it's possible, with a test, because I do business stuff,
45.18	so it's important that we focus on outcomes.
48.764	And then I struggled, because I was thinking to myself,
50.697	"""What should I talk? What should I do? It's a TED audience."
53.165	"It's got to be stretching. How am I going to make — ?"""
55.973	So I just hope I've got the level of difficulty right.
59.066	So let's just walk our way through this.
61.13	Please could you work this through with me? You can shout out the answer if you like.
64.579	The question is, which of these horizontal lines is longer?
66.761	The answer is?
67.907	Audience: The same.Eddie Obeng: The same.
70.631	No, they're not the same. (Laughter)
72.378	They're not the same. The top one is 10 percent longer than the bottom one.
76.007	So why did you tell me they were the same? Do you remember when we were kids at school,
79.316	about that big, they played the same trick on us?
81.771	It was to teach us parallax. Do you remember?
84.108	"And you got, you said, ""It's the same!"" And you got it wrong."
87.255	You remember? And you learned the answer, and you've carried this answer in your head for 10, 20, 30, 40 years:
91.091	The answer is the same. The answer is the same. So when you're asked what the lengths are,
94.971	you say they're the same, but they're not the same, because I've changed it.
97.54	And this is what I'm trying to explain has happened to us in the 21st century.
101.707	Somebody or something has changed the rules
104.005	about how our world works.
106.062	When I'm joking, I try and explain it happened at midnight,
108.968	you see, while we were asleep, but it was midnight 15 years ago. Okay?
112.804	You didn't notice it? But basically, what they do is,
115.419	they switched all the rules round, so that the way to
118.091	successfully run a business, an organization, or even a country,
121.683	has been deleted, flipped, and it's a completely new
124.364	— you think I'm joking, don't you — there's a completely new set of rules in operation. (Laughter)
128.644	Did you notice that? I mean, you missed this one.
130.454	You probably — No, you didn't. Okay. (Laughter)
132.289	My simple idea is that what's happened is,
136.631	the real 21st century around us isn't so obvious to us,
140.625	so instead we spend our time responding rationally
143.67	to a world which we understand and recognize,
146.843	but which no longer exists.
149.262	You don't believe me, do you? Okay. (Applause)
151.471	So let me take you on a little journey of many of the things I don't understand.
156.375	"If you search Amazon for the word ""creativity,"""
158.967	you'll discover something like 90,000 books.
161.334	"If you go on Google and you look for ""innovation + creativity,"""
164.138	"you get 30 million hits. If you add the word ""consultants,"" it doubles to 60 million. (Laughter)"
168.397	Are you with me? And yet, statistically, what you discover
171.582	is that about one in 100,000 ideas is found making money
174.567	or delivering benefits two years after its inception.
177.69	It makes no sense. Companies make their expensive executives
180.703	spend ages carefully preparing forecasts and budgets
183.263	which are obsolete or need changing before they can be published.
187.323	How is that possible? If you look at the visions we have,
191.046	the visions of how we're going to change the world,
192.823	the key thing is implementation. We have the vision.
195.448	We've got to make it happen.
196.804	We've spent decades professionalizing implementation.
199.796	People are supposed to be good at making stuff happen.
202.253	However, if I use as an example a family of five
207.15	going on holiday, if you can imagine this,
209.884	all the way from London all the way across to Hong Kong,
214.284	what I want you to think about is their budget is only 3,000 pounds of expenses.
218.193	What actually happens is, if I compare this to the average
221.324	real project, average real successful project,
227.111	the family actually end up in Makassar, South Sulawesi,
231.337	at a cost of 4,000 pounds,
234.354	whilst leaving two of the children behind. (Laughter)
237.059	What I'm trying to explain to you is, there are things which don't make sense to us.
241.394	It gets even worse than that. Let me just walk you through this one.
245.679	This is a quote, and I'll just pick words out of it.
248.253	"It says -- I'll put on the voice -- ""In summary, your Majesty,"
251.596	the failure to foresee the timing, extent and severity
255.102	of the crisis was due to the lack of creativity
258.865	"and the number of bright minds,"" or something like that."
262.263	This was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the Queen of England
266.071	when she asked the question,
268.076	"""Why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming?"" (Laughter)"
271.015	I'll never get my knighthood. I'll never get my knighthood. (Laughter)
274.518	That's not the important point. The thing you have to remember is,
276.746	these are eminent economists, some of the smartest people
280.208	on the planet. Do you see the challenge? (Laughter)
283.724	It's scary. My friend and mentor, Tim Brown of IDEO,
288.271	he explains that design must get big, and he's right.
292.173	He wisely explains this to us. He says design thinking
294.792	must tackle big systems for the challenges we have.
297.094	He's absolutely right.
299.231	"And then I ask myself, ""Why was it ever small?"""
302.904	Isn't it weird? You know, if collaboration is so cool,
306.766	is cross-functional working is so amazing,
308.899	why did we build these huge hierarchies? What's going on?
314.125	You see, I think what's happened, perhaps, is that
318.406	we've not noticed that change I described earlier.
322.492	What we do know is that the world has accelerated.
325.27	Cyberspace moves everything at the speed of light.
327.592	Technology accelerates things exponentially.
330.064	So if this is now, and that's the past,
332.226	and we start thinking about change, you know,
333.596	all governments are seeking change, you're here seeking change,
336.167	everybody's after change, it's really cool. (Laughter)
338.838	So what happens is, we get this wonderful whooshing acceleration and change.
343.281	The speed is accelerating. That's not the only thing.
347.377	At the same time, as we've done that, we've done something really weird.
350.048	We've doubled the population in 40 years,
352.697	put half of them in cities, then connected them all up so they can interact.
356.311	The density of the interaction of human beings is amazing.
359.18	There are charts which show all these movements of information. That density of information is amazing.
364.032	And then we've done a third thing.
365.666	you know, for those of you who have as an office
367.661	a little desk underneath the stairs, and you say, well this is my little desk under the stairs,
373.13	no! You are sitting at the headquarters of a global corporation if you're connected to the Internet.
379.521	What's happened is, we've changed the scale.
382.435	Size and scale are no longer the same.
385.382	And then add to that, every time you tweet,
388.604	over a third of your followers follow from a country
391.394	which is not your own.
394.302	Global is the new scale. We know that.
397.311	"And so people say things like, ""The world is now a turbulent place."" Have you heard them saying things like that?"
401.323	And they use it as a metaphor. Have you come across this?
404.084	And they think it's a metaphor, but this is not a metaphor.
407.217	It's reality. As a young engineering student, I remember
410.434	going to a demonstration where they basically,
414.425	the demonstrator did something quite intriguing.
416.836	What he did was, he got a transparent pipe — have you seen this demonstration before? —
422.018	he attached it to a tap. So effectively what you had was,
425.434	you had a situation where — I'll try and draw the tap
428.609	and the pipe, actually I'll skip the tap. The taps are hard.
431.324	"Okay? So I'll write the word ""tap."" Is that okay? It's a tap. (Laughter)"
434.522	Okay, so he attaches it to a transparent pipe, and he turns the water on.
438.324	And he says, do you notice anything? And the water is whooshing down this pipe.
440.945	I mean, this is not exciting stuff. Are you with me?
444.066	So the water goes up. He turns it back down. Great.
448.184	"And he says, ""Anything you notice?"" No. Then he sticks a needle into the pipe,"
451.896	and he connects this to a container, and he fills
454.072	the container up with green ink. You with me?
457.393	So guess what happens? A thin green line comes out
461.183	as it flows down the pipe. It's not that interesting.
465.529	And then he turns the water up a bit, so it starts coming back in. And nothing changes.
469.821	So he's changing the flow of the water, but it's just a boring green line.
473.007	He adds some more. He adds some more. And then something weird happens.
475.874	There's this little flicker, and then as he turns it ever so slightly more,
481.03	the whole of that green line disappears, and instead
484.005	there are these little sort of inky dust devils close to the needle.
487.365	They're called eddies. Not me. And they're violently dispersing the ink
490.529	so that it actually gets diluted out, and the color's gone.
494.213	What's happened in this world of pipe
498.226	is somebody has flipped it. They've changed the rules from laminar to turbulent.
502.153	All the rules are gone. In that environment, instantly,
505.834	all the possibilities which turbulence brings are available,
509.953	and it's not the same as laminar.
512.795	And if we didn't have that green ink, you'd never notice.
517.753	And I think this is our challenge, because somebody
521.05	has actually increased — and it's probably you guys with all your tech and stuff —
525.154	the speed, the scale and the density of interaction.
529.135	Now how do we cope and deal with that?
530.834	Well, we could just call it turbulence, or we could try and learn.
534.267	Yes, learn, but I know you guys grew up in the days when
539.365	there were actually these things called correct answers,
542.169	because of the answer you gave me to the horizontal line puzzle,
545.33	and you believe it will last forever.
547.143	So I'll put a little line up here which represents learning,
550.57	and that's how we used to do it. We could see things,
552.745	understand them, take the time to put them into practice.
555.258	Out here is the world. Now, what's happened to our pace
559.107	of learning as the world has accelerated? Well, if you work
562.352	for a corporation, you'll discover it's quite difficult to work
564.898	on stuff which your boss doesn't approve of, isn't in the strategy,
567.844	and anyway, you've got to go through your monthly meetings.
570.449	If you work in an institution, one day you will get them to make that decision.
575.817	And if you work in a market where people believe in cycles,
578.552	it's even funnier, because you have to wait all the way
580.939	"for the cycle to fail before you go, ""There's something wrong."" You with me?"
584.562	So it's likely that the line, in terms of learning, is pretty flat.
590.114	You with me? This point over here, the point at which
594.311	the lines cross over, the pace of change
598.214	overtakes the pace of learning,
601.358	and for me, that is what I was describing
604.243	when I was telling you about midnight.
607.5	So what does it do to us? Well, it completely transforms what we have to do,
610.661	many mistakes we make. We solve last year's problems
614.3	without thinking about the future. If you try and think about it,
617.036	the things you're solving now, what problems are they going to bring in the future?
619.972	If you haven't understood the world you're living in,
622.492	it's almost impossible to be absolutely certain that what you're going to deliver fits.
626.108	I'll give you an example, a quick one. Creativity and ideas,
629.516	I mentioned that earlier. All the CEOs around me, my clients, they want innovation,
632.557	"so they seek innovation. They say to people, ""Take risks and be creative!"""
635.861	But unfortunately the words get transformed as they travel through the air.
638.788	"Entering their ears, what they hear is, ""Do crazy things and then I'll fire you."" Why? (Laughter) Because —"
642.909	Why? Because in the old world, okay, in the old world,
646.564	over here, getting stuff wrong was unacceptable.
649.029	If you got something wrong, you'd failed. How should you be treated?
651.661	Well, harshly, because you could have asked somebody who had experience.
654.797	So we learned the answer and we carried this in our heads for 20, 30 years, are you with me?
659.861	The answer is, don't do things which are different.
662.564	And then suddenly we tell them to and it doesn't work.
664.787	You see, in reality, there are two ways you can fail in our new world.
667.399	One, you're doing something that you should follow a procedure to, and it's a very difficult thing,
671.25	you're sloppy, you get it wrong. How should you be treated? You should probably be fired.
674.732	On the other hand, you're doing something new, no one's ever done before,
677.964	you get it completely wrong. How should you be treated?
679.944	Well, free pizzas! You should be treated better than the people who succeed.
683.556	It's called smart failure. Why? Because you can't put it on your C.V.
687.044	So what I want to leave you, then, is with the explanation
689.773	of why I actually traveled 60,000 miles from my desk.
693.597	When I realized the power of this new world,
695.637	I quit my safe teaching job, and set up a virtual business school,
700.009	the first in the world, in order to teach people how to make this happen,
703.804	and I used some of my learnings about some of the rules which I'd learned on myself.
709.137	If you're interested, worldaftermidnight.com, you'll find out more,
712.186	but I've applied them to myself for over a decade,
715.106	and I'm still here, and I still have my house, and the most important thing is,
718.855	I hope I've done enough to inject a little green ink into your lives,
724.235	so that when you go away and you're making your next
726.978	absolutely sensible and rational decision, you'll take some time to think,
731.577	"""Hmm, I wonder whether this also makes sense"
734.657	"in our new world after midnight."" Thank you very much."
737.44	(Applause)
744.49	Thank you, thank you. (Applause)
