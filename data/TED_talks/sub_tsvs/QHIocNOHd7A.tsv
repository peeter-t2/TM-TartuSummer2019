16.26	We're here today to announce
18.26	the first synthetic cell,
21.26	a cell made by
23.26	starting with the digital code in the computer,
26.26	building the chromosome
29.26	from four bottles of chemicals,
32.26	assembling that chromosome in yeast,
34.26	transplanting it into
37.26	a recipient bacterial cell
39.26	and transforming that cell
41.26	into a new bacterial species.
44.26	So this is the first self-replicating species
47.26	that we've had on the planet
49.26	whose parent is a computer.
52.26	It also is the first species
54.26	to have its own website
56.26	encoded in its genetic code.
59.26	But we'll talk more about
61.26	the watermarks in a minute.
64.26	This is a project that had its inception
68.26	when our team then --
70.26	we called the institute TIGR --
72.26	was involved in sequencing
74.26	the first two genomes in history.
76.26	We did Haemophilus influenzae
78.26	and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism,
81.26	that of Mycoplasma genitalium.
84.26	And as soon as
86.26	we had these two sequences
88.26	we thought, if this is supposed to be the smallest genome
91.26	of a self-replicating species,
93.26	could there be even a smaller genome?
95.26	Could we understand the basis of cellular life
98.26	at the genetic level?
100.26	It's been a 15-year quest
102.26	just to get to the starting point now
104.26	to be able to answer those questions,
107.26	because it's very difficult to eliminate
109.26	multiple genes from a cell.
111.26	You can only do them one at a time.
114.26	We decided early on
116.26	that we had to take a synthetic route,
118.26	even though nobody had been there before,
120.26	to see if we could synthesize
122.26	a bacterial chromosome
124.26	so we could actually vary the gene content
126.26	to understand the essential genes for life.
129.26	That started our 15-year quest
132.26	to get here.
134.26	But before we did the first experiments,
136.26	we actually asked
139.26	Art Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvania
142.26	to undertake a review
144.26	of what the risks, the challenges,
147.26	the ethics around creating new
149.26	species in the laboratory were
151.26	because it hadn't been done before.
153.26	They spent about two years
155.26	reviewing that independently
157.26	and published their results in Science in 1999.
160.26	Ham and I took two years off
162.26	as a side project to sequence the human genome,
164.26	but as soon as that was done
166.26	we got back to the task at hand.
170.26	In 2002, we started
172.26	a new institute,
174.26	the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives,
177.26	where we set out two goals:
179.26	One, to understand
181.26	the impact of our technology on the environment,
184.26	and how to understand the environment better,
186.26	and two, to start down this process
188.26	of making synthetic life
191.26	to understand basic life.
194.26	In 2003,
196.26	we published our first success.
198.26	So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison
200.26	developed some new methods
202.26	for making error-free DNA
205.26	at a small level.
207.26	Our first task was
209.26	a 5,000-letter code bacteriophage,
212.26	a virus that attacks only E. coli.
216.26	So that was
218.26	the phage phi X 174,
220.26	which was chosen for historical reasons.
222.26	It was the first DNA phage,
225.26	DNA virus, DNA genome
228.26	that was actually sequenced.
230.26	So once we realized
233.26	that we could make 5,000-base pair
235.26	viral-sized pieces,
237.26	we thought, we at least have the means
239.26	then to try and make serially lots of these pieces
242.26	to be able to eventually assemble them together
245.26	to make this mega base chromosome.
249.26	So, substantially larger than
251.26	we even thought we would go initially.
255.26	There were several steps to this. There were two sides:
258.26	We had to solve the chemistry
260.26	for making large DNA molecules,
262.26	and we had to solve the biological side
264.26	of how, if we had this new chemical entity,
267.26	how would we boot it up, activate it
270.26	in a recipient cell.
273.26	We had two teams working in parallel:
275.26	one team on the chemistry,
277.26	and the other on trying to
280.26	be able to transplant
282.26	entire chromosomes
284.26	to get new cells.
287.26	When we started this out, we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem,
290.26	which is why we chose the smallest genome.
293.26	And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome
296.26	to a much larger one.
298.26	And we can walk through the reasons for that,
300.26	but basically the small cell
303.26	took on the order of
305.26	one to two months to get results from,
308.26	whereas the larger, faster-growing cell
310.26	takes only two days.
312.26	So there's only so many cycles we could go through
315.26	in a year at six weeks per cycle.
318.26	And you should know that basically
323.26	of our experiments failed.
325.26	So this was a debugging,
327.26	problem-solving scenario from the beginning
330.26	because there was no recipe
332.26	of how to get there.
334.26	So, one of the most important publications we had
337.26	was in 2007.
339.26	Carole Lartigue led the effort
342.26	to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome
345.26	from one bacteria to another.
347.26	I think philosophically, that was one of the most important papers
350.26	that we've ever done
352.26	because it showed how dynamic life was.
355.26	And we knew, once that worked,
357.26	that we actually had a chance
359.26	if we could make the synthetic chromosomes
361.26	to do the same with those.
364.26	We didn't know that it was going to take us
366.26	several years more to get there.
368.26	In 2008,
370.26	we reported the complete synthesis
372.26	of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome,
375.26	a little over 500,000 letters of genetic code,
379.26	but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome.
382.26	We think in part, because of its slow growth
386.26	and, in part,
388.26	cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms
391.26	to keep these events from happening.
393.26	It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into
396.26	had a nuclease, an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface,
399.26	and was happy to eat
401.26	the synthetic DNA that we gave it
403.26	and never got transplantations.
406.26	But at the time, that was the largest
408.26	molecule of a defined structure
410.26	that had been made.
412.26	And so both sides were progressing,
414.26	but part of the synthesis
416.26	had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished
419.26	using yeast, putting the fragments in yeast
422.26	and yeast would assemble these for us.
424.26	It's an amazing step forward,
427.26	but we had a problem because now we had
429.26	the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast.
432.26	So in addition to doing the transplant,
435.26	we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome
437.26	out of the eukaryotic yeast
439.26	into a form where we could transplant it
441.26	into a recipient cell.
445.26	So our team developed new techniques
448.26	for actually growing, cloning
450.26	entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast.
452.26	So we took the same mycoides genome
455.26	that Carole had initially transplanted,
457.26	and we grew that in yeast
459.26	as an artificial chromosome.
462.26	And we thought this would be a great test bed
464.26	for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast
466.26	and transplant them.
468.26	When we did these experiments, though,
470.26	we could get the chromosome out of yeast
472.26	but it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell.
476.26	That little issue took the team two years to solve.
479.26	It turns out, the DNA in the bacterial cell
482.26	was actually methylated,
484.26	and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme,
488.26	from digesting the DNA.
491.26	So what we found is if we took the chromosome
493.26	out of yeast and methylated it,
495.26	we could then transplant it.
497.26	Further advances came
499.26	when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes
502.26	from the recipient capricolum cell.
505.26	And once we had done that, now we can take
507.26	naked DNA out of yeast and transplant it.
510.26	So last fall
512.26	when we published the results of that work in Science,
515.26	we all became overconfident
517.26	and were sure we were only
519.26	a few weeks away
521.26	from being able to now boot up
523.26	a chromosome out of yeast.
526.26	Because of the problems with
528.26	Mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth
531.26	about a year and a half ago,
534.26	we decided to synthesize
537.26	the much larger chromosome, the mycoides chromosome,
540.26	knowing that we had the biology worked out on that
543.26	for transplantation.
545.26	And Dan led the team for the synthesis
547.26	of this over one-million-base pair chromosome.
552.26	But it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end,
555.26	and it set us back three months
557.26	because we had one error
559.26	out of over a million base pairs in that sequence.
562.26	So the team developed new debugging software,
565.26	where we could test each synthetic fragment
568.26	to see if it would grow in a background
570.26	of wild type DNA.
573.26	And we found that 10 out of the 11
579.26	were completely accurate
581.26	and compatible with
583.26	a life-forming sequence.
587.26	We narrowed it down to one fragment;
589.26	we sequenced it
591.26	and found just one base pair had been deleted
593.26	in an essential gene.
595.26	So accuracy is essential.
598.26	There's parts of the genome
600.26	where it cannot tolerate even a single error,
603.26	and then there's parts of the genome
605.26	where we can put in large blocks of DNA,
607.26	as we did with the watermarks,
609.26	and it can tolerate all kinds of errors.
612.26	So it took about three months to find that error
615.26	and repair it.
617.26	And then early one morning, at 6 a.m.
620.26	we got a text from Dan
623.26	saying that, now, the first blue colonies existed.
626.26	So, it's been a long route to get here:
632.26	We felt
634.26	one of the tenets of this field
636.26	was to make absolutely certain
639.26	we could distinguish synthetic DNA
642.26	from natural DNA.
644.26	Early on, when you're working in a new area of science,
647.26	you have to think about all the pitfalls
650.26	and things that could lead you
652.26	to believe that you had done something when you hadn't,
655.26	and, even worse, leading others to believe it.
658.26	So, we thought the worst problem would be
660.26	a single molecule contamination
663.26	of the native chromosome,
665.26	leading us to believe that we actually had
668.26	created a synthetic cell,
670.26	when it would have been just a contaminant.
672.26	So early on, we developed the notion
674.26	of putting in watermarks in the DNA
676.26	to absolutely make clear
678.26	that the DNA was synthetic.
681.26	And the first chromosome we built
684.26	in 2008 --
686.26	the 500,000-base pair one --
688.26	we simply assigned
691.26	the names of the authors of the chromosome
694.26	into the genetic code,
697.26	but it was using just amino acid
699.26	single letter translations,
701.26	which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet.
705.26	So the team actually developed a new code
708.26	within the code within the code.
711.26	So it's a new code
713.26	for interpreting and writing messages in DNA.
716.26	Now, mathematicians have been hiding and writing
719.26	messages in the genetic code for a long time,
722.26	but it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists
725.26	because, if you write long messages
728.26	with the code that the mathematicians developed,
731.26	it would more than likely lead to
733.26	new proteins being synthesized
736.26	with unknown functions.
739.26	So the code that Mike Montague and the team developed
742.26	actually puts frequent stop codons,
744.26	so it's a different alphabet
747.26	but allows us to use
749.26	the entire English alphabet
752.26	with punctuation and numbers.
754.26	So, there are four major watermarks
756.26	all over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code.
759.26	The first one actually contains within it
762.26	this code for interpreting
765.26	the rest of the genetic code.
769.26	So in the remaining information,
771.26	in the watermarks,
773.26	contain the names of, I think it's
778.26	and key contributors
780.26	to getting the project to this stage.
784.26	And we also built in
786.26	a website address
789.26	so that if somebody decodes the code
791.26	within the code within the code,
793.26	they can send an email to that address.
795.26	So it's clearly distinguishable
798.26	from any other species,
800.26	having 46 names in it,
803.26	its own web address.
807.26	And we added three quotations,
810.26	because with the first genome
812.26	we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound
815.26	than just signing the work.
817.26	So we won't give the rest of the code,
819.26	but we will give the three quotations.
821.26	The first is,
823.26	"""To live, to err,"
825.26	to fall, to triumph
827.26	"and to recreate life out of life."""
829.26	It's a James Joyce quote.
833.26	"The second quotation is, ""See things not as they are,"
836.26	"but as they might be."""
838.26	"It's a quote from the ""American Prometheus"""
841.26	book on Robert Oppenheimer.
843.26	And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote:
846.26	"""What I cannot build,"
848.26	"I cannot understand."""
853.26	So, because this is as much a philosophical advance
856.26	as a technical advance in science,
859.26	we tried to deal with both the philosophical
862.26	and the technical side.
864.26	The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions
866.26	is that the extensive work
869.26	that we've done --
871.26	asking for ethical review,
873.26	pushing the envelope
875.26	on that side as well as the technical side --
878.26	this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community,
881.26	in the policy community
883.26	and at the highest levels of the federal government.
886.26	Even with this announcement,
889.26	as we did in 2003 --
891.26	that work was funded by the Department of Energy,
894.26	so the work was reviewed
896.26	at the level of the White House,
898.26	trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it.
901.26	And they came down on the side of open publication,
904.26	which is the right approach --
907.26	we've briefed the White House,
909.26	we've briefed members of Congress,
912.26	we've tried to take and push
914.26	the policy issues
916.26	in parallel with the scientific advances.
920.26	So with that, I would like
922.26	to open it first to the floor for questions.
925.26	Yes, in the back.
927.26	Reporter: Could you explain, in layman's terms,
929.26	how significant a breakthrough this is please?
933.26	Craig Venter: Can we explain how significant this is?
935.26	I'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is.
938.26	It's significant to us.
941.26	Perhaps it's a giant philosophical change
944.26	in how we view life.
946.26	We actually view it as a baby step in terms of,
949.26	it's taken us 15 years to be able
951.26	to do the experiment
953.26	we wanted to do 15 years ago
955.26	on understanding life at its basic level.
958.26	But we actually believe
960.26	this is going to be a very powerful set of tools
964.26	and we're already starting
966.26	in numerous avenues
968.26	to use this tool.
970.26	We have, at the Institute,
972.26	ongoing funding now from NIH
975.26	in a program with Novartis
977.26	to try and use these new
979.26	synthetic DNA tools
981.26	to perhaps make the flu vaccine
984.26	that you might get next year.
987.26	Because instead of taking weeks to months to make these,
990.26	Dan's team can now make these
993.26	in less than 24 hours.
996.26	So when you see how long it took to get an H1N1 vaccine out,
999.26	we think we can shorten that process
1001.26	quite substantially.
1003.26	In the vaccine area,
1005.26	Synthetic Genomics and the Institute
1007.26	are forming a new vaccine company
1009.26	because we think these tools can affect vaccines
1012.26	to diseases that haven't been possible to date,
1015.26	things where the viruses rapidly evolve,
1018.26	such with rhinovirus.
1020.26	Wouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds?
1023.26	Or, more importantly, HIV,
1026.26	where the virus evolves so quickly
1028.26	the vaccines that are made today
1030.26	can't keep up
1032.26	with those evolutionary changes.
1035.26	Also, at Synthetic Genomics,
1037.26	we've been working
1039.26	on major environmental issues.
1041.26	I think this latest oil spill in the Gulf
1043.26	is a reminder.
1045.26	We can't see CO2 --
1047.26	we depend on scientific measurements for it
1049.26	and we see the beginning results
1051.26	of having too much of it --
1053.26	but we can see pre-CO2 now
1055.26	floating on the waters
1057.26	and contaminating the beaches in the Gulf.
1060.26	We need some alternatives
1063.26	for oil.
1065.26	We have a program with Exxon Mobile
1067.26	to try and develop new strains of algae
1070.26	that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide
1073.26	from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources,
1076.26	make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries
1079.26	to make normal gasoline
1081.26	and diesel fuel out of CO2.
1083.26	Those are just a couple of the approaches
1085.26	and directions that we're taking.
1088.26	(Applause)
