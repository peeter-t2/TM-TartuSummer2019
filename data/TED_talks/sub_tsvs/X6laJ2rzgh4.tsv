20.16	I was a student in the '60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning,
25.466	and -- on a personal level -- an awakening sense of idealism.
30.092	The war in Vietnam was raging, the Civil Rights movement was under way
34.297	and pictures had a powerful influence on me.
37.443	Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing
41.066	and photographers were telling us another.
43.779	I believed the photographers and so did millions of other Americans.
48.323	Their images fuelled resistance to the war and to racism.
52.484	They not only recorded history -- they helped change the course of history.
57.128	Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness
60.746	and, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience,
64.639	change became not only possible, but inevitable.
67.927	It puts a human face on issues which, from afar,
71.678	can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact.
77.085	What happens at ground level, far from the halls of power,
81.73	happens to ordinary citizens one by one.
85.152	And I understood that documentary photography
87.475	has the ability to interpret events from their point of view.
91.965	It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice.
96.013	My TED wish. Thereâ€™s a vital story that needs to be told
101.498	and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it
105.105	and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways
108.689	to use news photography in the digital era.
111.938	Thank you very much.
