15.662	I grew up in Bihar, India's poorest state,
20.671	and I remember when I was six years old,
24.137	I remember coming home one day to find a cart
27.903	full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep.
33.224	My brothers and I dug in,
36.713	and that's when my father came home.
40.001	He was livid, and I still remember how we cried
45.465	when that cart with our half-eaten sweets
49.529	was pulled away from us.
52.746	Later, I understood why my father got so upset.
57.547	Those sweets were a bribe
60.772	from a contractor who was trying to get my father
64.353	to award him a government contract.
67.816	My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar,
72.477	and he had developed a firm stance against corruption,
77.08	even though he was harassed and threatened.
81.128	His was a lonely struggle, because Bihar
84.496	was also India's most corrupt state,
88.233	where public officials were enriching themselves,
91.995	[rather] than serving the poor who had no means
96.088	to express their anguish if their children
100.034	had no food or no schooling.
103.867	And I experienced this most viscerally
108.224	when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty.
114.522	And as I went village to village,
118.339	I remember one day, when I was famished and exhausted,
124.851	and I was almost collapsing
127.17	in a scorching heat under a tree,
130.2	and just at that time, one of the poorest men in that village
136.259	invited me into his hut and graciously fed me.
142.175	Only I later realized that what he fed me
146.823	was food for his entire family for two days.
152.566	This profound gift of generosity
156.989	challenged and changed the very purpose of my life.
162.267	I resolved to give back.
166.039	Later, I joined the World Bank, which sought to fight
170.343	such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries.
176.111	My initial work focused on Uganda, where I focused
181.143	on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda
185.371	so they could access our loans.
188.2	But after we disbursed the loans, I remember
191.331	a trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools
196.049	without textbooks or teachers,
198.833	new health clinics without drugs,
201.753	and the poor once again without any voice or recourse.
207.536	It was Bihar all over again.
211.112	Bihar represents the challenge of development:
215.072	abject poverty surrounded by corruption.
218.983	Globally, 1.3 billion people live on less than
223.243	$1.25 a day, and the work I did in Uganda
227.952	represents the traditional approach to these problems
232.883	that has been practiced since 1944,
237.175	when winners of World War II, 500 founding fathers,
242.795	and one lonely founding mother,
246.231	gathered in New Hampshire, USA,
248.658	to establish the Bretton Woods institutions,
251.277	including the World Bank.
253.082	And that traditional approach to development
256.382	had three key elements. First, transfer of resources
260.318	from rich countries in the North
262.269	to poorer countries in the South,
264.766	accompanied by reform prescriptions.
267.659	Second, the development institutions that channeled
271.225	these transfers were opaque, with little transparency
275.987	of what they financed or what results they achieved.
279.787	And third, the engagement in developing countries
283.7	was with a narrow set of government elites
286.982	with little interaction with the citizens, who are
290.296	the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance.
294.581	Today, each of these elements is opening up
298.782	due to dramatic changes in the global environment.
302.142	Open knowledge, open aid, open governance,
305.837	and together, they represent three key shifts
309.582	that are transforming development
312.352	and that also hold greater hope for the problems
316.065	I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar.
320.638	The first key shift is open knowledge.
323.604	You know, developing countries today will not simply
327.165	accept solutions that are handed down to them
330.762	by the U.S., Europe or the World Bank.
334.389	They get their inspiration, their hope,
337.224	their practical know-how,
339.624	from successful emerging economies in the South.
343.175	They want to know how China lifted 500 million people
347.855	out of poverty in 30 years,
351.518	how Mexico's Oportunidades program
354.464	improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children.
359.16	This is the new ecosystem of open-knowledge flows,
364.822	not just traveling North to South, but South to South,
369.755	and even South to North,
372.058	with Mexico's Oportunidades today inspiring New York City.
377.8	And just as these North-to-South transfers are opening up,
381.648	so too are the development institutions
384.488	that channeled these transfers.
387.015	This is the second shift: open aid.
390.884	Recently, the World Bank opened its vault of data
394.434	for public use, releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators
399.297	for 200 countries over 50 years,
403.666	and it launched a global competition to crowdsource
407.644	innovative apps using this data.
411.311	Development institutions today are also opening
414.484	for public scrutiny the projects they finance.
418.298	Take GeoMapping. In this map from Kenya,
422.563	the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors
427.282	are located, and the darker the shade of green,
431.274	the more the number of out-of-school children.
434.634	So this simple mashup reveals that donors
438.77	have not financed any schools in the areas
441.746	with the most out-of-school children,
443.854	provoking new questions. Is development assistance
447.946	targeting those who most need our help?
452.565	In this manner, the World Bank has now GeoMapped
460.409	and donors are using a common platform
463.585	to map all their projects.
466.53	This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency
471.392	and accountability of aid.
474.234	And this leads me to the third, and in my view,
477.23	the most significant shift in development:
480.562	open governance. Governments today are opening up
484.777	just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability.
488.754	From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India,
492.784	using mobile phones and social media
495.518	not just for political accountability
498.132	but also for development accountability.
502.277	Are governments delivering services to the citizens?
506.749	So for instance, several governments in Africa
510.894	and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public.
515.918	But, you know, there is a big difference between a budget
519.321	that's public and a budget that's accessible.
523.358	This is a public budget. (Laughter)
528.278	And as you can see, it's not really accessible
531.383	or understandable to an ordinary citizen
534.102	that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources.
539.1	To tackle this problem, governments are using new tools
543.035	to visualize the budget so it's more understandable
547.718	to the public.
549.918	In this map from Moldova, the green color shows
553.852	those districts that have low spending on schools
557.94	but good educational outcomes,
560.26	and the red color shows the opposite.
563.509	Tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents
570.036	into a publicly understandable visual,
573.79	and what's exciting is that with this openness,
577.556	there are today new opportunities for citizens
581.414	to give feedback and engage with government.
584.94	So in the Philippines today, parents and students
589.323	can give real-time feedback on a website,
593.47	Checkmyschool.org, or using SMS, whether teachers
598.562	and textbooks are showing up in school,
601.356	the same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar.
606.007	And the government is responsive. So for instance,
608.859	when it was reported on this website that 800 students
613.369	were at risk because school repairs had stalled
617.555	due to corruption, the Department of Education
620.146	in the Philippines took swift action.
623.1	And you know what's exciting is that this innovation
626.797	is now spreading South to South, from the Philippines
631.459	to Indonesia, Kenya, Moldova and beyond.
635.804	In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, even an impoverished
640.063	community was able to use these tools
643.617	to voice its aspirations.
646.589	This is what the map of Tandale looked like
649.508	in August, 2011. But within a few weeks,
653.861	university students were able to use mobile phones
658.327	and an open-source platform to dramatically map
662.877	the entire community infrastructure.
666.364	And what is very exciting is that citizens were then
670.829	able to give feedback as to which health or water points
675.836	were not working, aggregated
678.71	in the red bubbles that you see,
681.31	which together provides a graphic visual
685.908	of the collective voices of the poor.
690.363	Today, even Bihar is turning around and opening up
695.973	under a committed leadership that is making government
698.845	transparent, accessible and responsive to the poor.
704.013	But, you know, in many parts of the world,
707.541	governments are not interested in opening up
710.519	or in serving the poor, and it is a real challenge
715.636	for those who want to change the system.
719.98	These are the lonely warriors
723.549	like my father and many, many others,
727.013	and a key frontier of development work
730.137	is to help these lonely warriors join hands
735.333	so they can together overcome the odds.
738.874	So for instance, today, in Ghana, courageous reformers
743.617	from civil society, Parliament and government,
746.817	have forged a coalition for transparent contracts
751.009	in the oil sector, and, galvanized by this,
755.065	reformers in Parliament are now investigating dubious contracts.
760.745	These examples give new hope, new possibility
765.673	to the problems I witnessed in Uganda
768.785	or that my father confronted in Bihar.
773.887	Two years ago, on April 8th, 2010, I called my father.
780.856	It was very late at night, and at age 80,
786.254	he was typing a 70-page public interest litigation
791.055	against corruption in a road project.
794.669	Though he was no lawyer, he argued the case in court
799.287	himself the next day. He won the ruling,
803.501	but later that very evening,
805.523	he fell, and he died.
810.117	He fought till the end, increasingly passionate
815.061	that to combat corruption and poverty,
819.006	not only did government officials need to be honest,
823.013	but citizens needed to join together
826.262	to make their voices heard.
829.157	These became the two bookends of his life,
834.018	and the journey he traveled in between
836.732	mirrored the changing development landscape.
841.517	Today, I'm inspired by these changes, and I'm excited
846.47	that at the World Bank, we are embracing
849.574	these new directions, a significant departure
852.663	from my work in Uganda 20 years ago.
856.541	We need to radically open up development
860.082	so knowledge flows in multiple directions,
862.886	inspiring practitioners, so aid becomes transparent,
867.677	accountable and effective, so governments open up
871.836	and citizens are engaged and empowered
875.782	with reformers in government.
877.441	We need to accelerate these shifts.
880.638	If we do, we will find that the collective voices
885.638	of the poor will be heard in Bihar,
890.028	in Uganda, and beyond.
892.25	We will find that textbooks and teachers
896.325	will show up in schools for their children.
899.362	We will find that these children, too,
903.445	have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty.
909.563	Thank you. (Applause)
912.778	(Applause)
