12.56	Jenni Chang: When I told
12.56	my parents I was gay,
14.88	the first thing they said to me was,
17.08	"""We're bringing you back to Taiwan."""
19.32	(Laughter)
22	In their minds, my sexual orientation
22	was America's fault.
25.88	The West had corrupted me
25.88	with divergent ideas,
28.84	and if only my parents
28.84	had never left Taiwan,
31.84	this would not have happened
31.84	to their only daughter.
35.32	In truth, I wondered if they were right.
38.44	Of course, there are gay people in Asia,
40.52	just as there are gay people
40.52	in every part of the world.
43.76	"But is the idea of living an ""out"" life,"
46.72	"in the ""I'm gay, this is my spouse,"
46.72	"and we're proud of our lives together"""
50.4	kind of way just a Western idea?
55.16	If I had grown up in Taiwan,
55.16	or any place outside of the West,
58.88	would I have found models
58.88	of happy, thriving LGBT people?
63.96	Lisa Dazols: I had similar notions.
65.651	As an HIV social worker in San Francisco,
67.88	I had met many gay immigrants.
69.88	They told me their stories
69.88	of persecution in their home countries,
73.08	just for being gay,
74.6	and the reasons
74.6	why they escaped to the US.
77.08	I saw how this had beaten them down.
79.24	After 10 years of doing this kind of work,
81.28	I needed better stories for myself.
83.76	I knew the world was far from perfect,
85.8	but surely not every gay story was tragic.
89.16	JC: So as a couple, we both had a need
89.16	to find stories of hope.
92.8	So we set off on a mission
92.8	to travel the world
95.76	and look for the people
95.76	"we finally termed as the ""Supergays."""
99.64	(Laughter)
103.76	These would be the LGBT individuals
106.24	who were doing something
106.24	extraordinary in the world.
109.6	They would be courageous, resilient,
111.96	and most of all, proud of who they were.
114.92	They would be the kind of person
114.92	that I aspire to be.
118.24	Our plan was to share their stories
118.24	to the world through film.
122.8	LD: There was just one problem.
124.4	We had zero reporting
124.4	and zero filmmaking experience.
127.48	(Laughter)
128.52	We didn't even know
128.52	where to find the Supergays,
130.88	so we just had to trust that we'd
130.88	figure it all out along the way.
134	So we picked 15 countries
134	in Asia, Africa and South America,
137.44	countries outside the West
137.44	that varied in terms of LGBT rights.
141.12	We bought a camcorder,
142.4	ordered a book
142.4	on how to make a documentary --
144.567	(Laughter)
146.24	you can learn a lot these days --
148.8	and set off on an around-the-world trip.
152.52	JC: One of the first countries
152.52	that we traveled to was Nepal.
156.28	Despite widespread poverty,
156.28	a decade-long civil war,
159.8	and now recently,
159.8	a devastating earthquake,
162.92	Nepal has made significant strides
162.92	in the fight for equality.
166.96	One of the key figures
166.96	in the movement is Bhumika Shrestha.
172.04	A beautiful, vibrant transgendered woman,
175.36	Bhumika has had to overcome
175.36	being expelled from school
178.56	and getting incarcerated
178.56	because of her gender presentation.
182.88	But, in 2007, Bhumika
182.88	and Nepal's LGBT rights organization
188	successfully petitioned
188	the Nepali Supreme Court
191.08	to protect against LGBT discrimination.
193.8	Here's Bhumika:
195.04	(Video) BS: What I'm most proud of?
196.8	I'm a transgendered person.
198.32	I'm so proud of my life.
200.12	On December 21, 2007,
203.88	the supreme court gave the decision
203.88	for the Nepal government
207.56	to give transgender identity cards
210.32	and same-sex marriage.
212.28	LD: I can appreciate
212.28	Bhumika's confidence on a daily basis.
215.6	Something as simple
215.6	as using a public restroom
218.52	can be a huge challenge
218.52	when you don't fit in
221.08	to people's strict gender expectations.
224.16	Traveling throughout Asia,
225.88	I tended to freak out women
225.88	in public restrooms.
228.44	They weren't used to seeing
228.44	someone like me.
230.88	I had to come up with a strategy,
230.88	so that I could just pee in peace.
234.095	(Laughter)
235.4	So anytime I would enter a restroom,
237.139	I would thrust out my chest
237.139	to show my womanly parts,
240.12	and try to be as
240.12	non-threatening as possible.
242.28	"Putting out my hands and saying, ""Hello"","
244.28	just so that people
244.28	could hear my feminine voice.
247.68	This all gets pretty exhausting,
247.68	but it's just who I am.
250.56	I can't be anything else.
253.48	JC: After Nepal, we traveled to India.
256.56	On one hand, India is a Hindu society,
260.12	without a tradition of homophobia.
263.04	On the other hand, it is also a society
263.04	with a deeply patriarchal system,
267.32	which rejects anything
267.32	that threatens the male-female order.
271.48	When we spoke to activists,
273.12	they told us that empowerment begins
273.12	with ensuring proper gender equality,
278.28	where the women's status
278.28	is established in society.
281.36	And in that way, the status of LGBT people
281.36	can be affirmed as well.
286.44	LD: There we met Prince Manvendra.
288.92	He's the world's first openly gay prince.
292.64	Prince Manvendra came out
292.64	"on the ""Oprah Winfrey Show,"""
295.2	very internationally.
296.48	His parents disowned him
297.76	and accused him of bringing
297.76	great shame to the royal family.
301.04	We sat down with Prince Manvendra
302.68	and talked to him about why he decided
302.68	to come out so very publicly.
306.56	Here he is:
307.8	(Video) Prince Manvendra: 
307.8	I felt there was a lot of need
310.36	to break this stigma and discrimination
310.36	which is existing in our society.
314.56	And that instigated me to come out openly
314.56	and talk about myself.
319.72	Whether we are gay, we are lesbian,
319.72	we are transgender, bisexual
323.2	or whatever sexual minority we come from,
325.56	we have to all unite
325.56	and fight for our rights.
329.64	Gay rights cannot be won
329.64	in the court rooms,
332.6	but in the hearts and the minds
332.6	of the people.
335.92	JC: While getting my hair cut,
337.68	the woman cutting my hair asked me,
339.96	"""Do you have a husband?"""
341.8	Now, this was a dreaded question
343.6	that I got asked a lot
343.6	by locals while traveling.
347.2	When I explained to her
347.2	that I was with a woman instead of a man,
350.92	she was incredulous,
352.28	and she asked me a lot of questions
352.28	about my parents' reactions
355.68	and whether I was sad
355.68	that I'd never be able to have children.
360.04	I told her that there are
360.04	no limitations to my life
363.08	and that Lisa and I do plan
363.08	to have a family some day.
367.04	Now, this woman was ready to write me off
369.44	as yet another crazy Westerner.
372.28	She couldn't imagine
372.28	that such a phenomenon
374.32	could happen in her own country.
376.36	That is, until I showed her
376.36	the photos of the Supergays
379.004	that we interviewed in India.
381.6	She recognized Prince Manvendra
381.6	from television
384.04	and soon I had an audience
384.04	of other hairdressers
386.303	interested in meeting me.
387.518	(Laughter)
389.4	And in that ordinary afternoon,
391.72	I had the chance to introduce
391.72	an entire beauty salon
394.68	to the social changes
394.68	that were happening in their own country.
399.52	LD: From India,
399.52	we traveled to East Africa,
402.16	a region known for intolerance
402.16	towards LGBT people.
406.16	In Kenya, 89 percent of people
406.16	who come out to their families
409.68	are disowned.
411	Homosexual acts are a crime
411	and can lead to incarceration.
414.72	In Kenya, we met
414.72	the soft-spoken David Kuria.
418.4	David had a huge mission
418.4	of wanting to work for the poor
421.36	and improve his own government.
423.12	So he decided to run for senate.
425.28	He became Kenya's first
425.28	openly gay political candidate.
429.96	David wanted to run his campaign
429.96	without denying the reality of who he was.
434.64	But we were worried for his safety
436.32	because he started
436.32	to receive death threats.
438.6	(Video) David Kuria: 
438.6	At that point, I was really scared
441.24	because they were
441.24	actually asking for me to be killed.
445.04	And, yeah,
447.88	there are some people out there who do it
450.16	and they feel that they are doing
450.16	a religious obligation.
453.8	JC: David wasn't ashamed of who he was.
456.4	Even in the face of threats,
458.28	he stayed authentic.
460.88	LD: At the opposite end
460.88	of the spectrum is Argentina.
464.12	Argentina's a country where 92 percent
464.12	of the population identifies as Catholic.
468.44	Yet, Argentina has LGBT laws
468.44	that are even more progressive
472.16	than here in the US.
474.52	In 2010, Argentina became
474.52	the first country in Latin America
478.96	and the 10th in the world
478.96	to adopt marriage equality.
482.44	There, we met María Rachid.
484.68	María was a driving force
484.68	behind that movement.
487.32	María Rachid (Spanish):
487.32	I always say that, in reality,
489.88	the effects of marriage equality
491.48	are not only for those couples
491.48	that get married.
493.76	They are for a lot of people that,
493.76	even though they may never get married,
497.28	will be perceived differently
497.28	by their coworkers,
499.64	their families and neighbors,
502.72	from the national state's
502.72	message of equality.
507.2	I feel very proud of Argentina
509.08	because Argentina today
509.08	is a model of equality.
513.12	And hopefully soon,
514.72	the whole world will have the same rights.
519.68	JC: When we made the visit
519.68	to my ancestral lands,
522.44	I wish I could have shown
522.44	my parents what we found there.
525.52	Because here is who we met:
527.48	(Video) One, two, three.
527.48	Welcome gays to Shanghai!
532.64	(Laughter)
538.44	A whole community of young,
538.44	beautiful Chinese LGBT people.
544.04	Sure, they had their struggles.
545.56	But they were fighting it out.
547.84	In Shanghai, I had the chance
547.84	to speak to a local lesbian group
551.92	and tell them our story
551.92	in my broken Mandarin Chinese.
555.6	In Taipei, each time
555.6	we got onto the metro,
558.28	we saw yet another
558.28	lesbian couple holding hands.
561.48	And we learned that Asia's
561.48	largest LGBT pride event
565.64	happens just blocks away
565.64	from where my grandparents live.
570.04	If only my parents knew.
573.387	LD: By the time we finished our
573.387	not-so-straight journey around the world,
576.84	(Laughter)
578.08	we had traveled 50,000 miles
579.8	and logged 120 hours of video footage.
582.48	We traveled to 15 countries
584	and interviewed 50 Supergays.
586.08	Turns out, it wasn't hard
586.08	to find them at all.
589.48	JC: Yes, there are still
589.48	tragedies that happen
592	on the bumpy road to equality.
594.28	And let's not forget that 75 countries
594.28	still criminalize homosexuality today.
599.88	But there are also stories
599.88	of hope and courage
603.36	in every corner of the world.
606.6	What we ultimately took away
606.6	from our journey is,
609.72	equality is not a Western invention.
614.84	LD: One of the key factors
614.84	in this equality movement is momentum,
619.16	momentum as more and more people
619.16	embrace their full selves
622.56	and use whatever opportunities they have
624.72	to change their part of the world,
626.96	and momentum as more and more countries
629.2	find models of equality in one another.
632.2	When Nepal protected
632.2	against LGBT discrimination,
635.76	India pushed harder.
637.56	When Argentina embraced marriage equality,
640.48	Uruguay and Brazil followed.
642.72	When Ireland said yes to equality,
645.68	(Applause)
649.76	the world stopped to notice.
651.72	When the US Supreme Court
651.72	makes a statement to the world
654.4	that we can all be proud of.
655.76	(Applause)
662.56	JC: As we reviewed our footage,
664.12	what we realized is that
664.12	we were watching a love story.
668.08	It wasn't a love story
668.08	that was expected of me,
670.88	but it is one filled
670.88	with more freedom, adventure and love
675.24	than I could have ever possibly imagined.
678.2	One year after returning home
678.2	from our trip,
680.76	marriage equality came to California.
683.76	And in the end, we believe,
683.76	love will win out.
690.56	(Video) By the power vested in me,
693.44	by the state of California
696.04	and by God Almighty,
698.32	I now pronounce you spouses for life.
701.68	You may kiss.
702.92	(Applause)
