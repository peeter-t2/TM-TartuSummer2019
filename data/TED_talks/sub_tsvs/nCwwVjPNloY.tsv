13.227	I was a Marine with 1/1 Weapons Company,
16.474	out in Camp Pendleton, California.
18.503	Oorah!
19.679	Audience: Oorah!
20.855	(Laughter)
21.88	I joined a few months after September 11,
23.872	feeling like I think most people
23.872	in the country did at the time,
26.915	filled with a sense
26.915	of patriotism and retribution
30.224	and the desire to do something --
31.89	that, coupled with that fact
31.89	that I wasn't doing anything.
34.659	I was 17, just graduated
34.659	from high school that past summer,
37.929	living in the back room
37.929	of my parents' house paying rent,
40.655	in the small town I was raised in
40.655	in Northern Indiana,
43.268	called Mishawaka.
44.45	I can spell that later
44.45	for people who are interested --
47.052	(Laughter)
48.08	Mishawaka is many good things
48.08	but cultural hub of the world it is not,
51.964	so my only exposure to theater and film
53.884	was limited to the plays
53.884	I did in high school
56.037	and Blockbuster Video,
56.037	may she rest in peace.
58.289	(Laughter)
59.485	I was serious enough about acting
61.156	that I auditioned for Juilliard
61.156	when I was a senior in high school,
64.488	didn't get in,
65.663	determined college wasn't for me
65.663	and applied nowhere else,
68.413	which was a genius move.
69.73	I also did that Hail Mary
69.73	LA acting odyssey
73.205	that I always heard stories about,
74.864	of actors moving to LA
74.864	with, like, seven dollars
77.189	and finding work and successful careers.
79.156	I got as far as Amarillo, Texas,
79.156	before my car broke down.
82.536	I spent all my money repairing it,
84.287	finally made it to Santa Monica --
85.956	not even LA --
87.258	stayed for 48 hours wandering
87.258	the beach, basically,
89.941	got in my car, drove home,
91.251	thus ending my acting career, so --
92.981	(Laughter)
94.283	Seventeen, Mishawaka ...
96.195	parents' house, paying rent,
96.195	selling vacuums ...
100.047	telemarketing,
101.626	cutting grass at the local
101.626	4-H fairgrounds.
103.833	This was my world
103.833	going into September, 2001.
106.149	So after the 11th,
107.324	and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty,
109.55	and just being pissed off
109.55	in general -- at myself,
111.925	my parents, the government;
113.345	not having confidence,
113.345	not having a respectable job,
115.822	my shitty mini-fridge that I just
115.822	drove to California and back --
118.948	I joined the Marine Corps and loved it.
118.948	I loved being a Marine.
121.945	It's one of the things I'm most proud
121.945	of having done in my life.
125.007	Firing weapons was cool,
126.197	driving and detonating
126.197	expensive things was great.
128.656	But I found I loved
128.656	the Marine Corps the most
130.788	for the thing I was looking
130.788	for the least when I joined,
133.453	which was the people:
134.638	these weird dudes --
134.638	a motley crew of characters
138.242	from a cross section
138.242	of the United States --
140.648	that on the surface I had
140.648	nothing in common with.
143.003	And over time,
144.635	all the political and personal bravado
146.485	that led me to the military dissolved,
148.386	and for me, the Marine Corps
148.386	became synonymous with my friends.
151.392	And then, a few years into my service
153.704	and months away from deploying to Iraq,
155.807	I dislocated my sternum
155.807	in a mountain-biking accident,
158.696	and had to be medically separated.
160.362	Those never in the military
160.362	may find this hard to understand,
163.319	but being told I wasn't getting deployed
163.319	to Iraq or Afghanistan
166.406	was very devastating for me.
167.873	I have a very clear image of leaving
167.873	the base hospital on a stretcher
171.138	and my entire platoon is waiting
171.138	outside to see if I was OK.
174.032	And then, suddenly,
174.032	I was a civilian again.
176.49	I knew I wanted to give
176.49	acting another shot,
178.719	because -- again, this is me --
180.547	I thought all civilian problems
180.547	are small compared to the military.
184.29	I mean, what can you really
184.29	bitch about now, you know?
187.071	"""It's hot."
188.672	Someone should turn
188.672	"on the air conditioner."""
190.928	"""This coffee line is too long."""
193.155	I was a Marine,
194.331	I knew how to survive.
195.506	I'd go to New York and become an actor.
197.468	If things didn't work out,
198.753	I'd live in Central Park
198.753	and dumpster-dive behind Panera Bread.
201.761	(Laughter)
202.786	I re-auditioned for Juilliard
202.786	and this time I was lucky,
205.5	I got in.
206.675	But I was surprised
206.675	by how complex the transition was
209.24	from military to civilian.
210.565	And I was relatively healthy; I can't
210.565	imagine going through that process
214.064	on top of a mental or physical injury.
215.95	But regardless, it was difficult.
217.565	In part, because I was in acting school --
219.759	I couldn't justify going
219.759	to voice and speech class,
223.757	throwing imaginary balls of energy
223.757	at the back of the room,
226.612	doing acting exercises
226.612	where I gave birth to myself --
229.199	(Laughter)
230.224	while my friends were serving
230.224	without me overseas.
232.982	But also, because I didn't
232.982	know how to apply the things
235.615	I learned in the military
235.615	to a civilian context.
237.992	I mean that both practically
237.992	and emotionally.
240.175	Practically, I had to get a job.
241.768	And I was an Infantry Marine,
243.524	where you're shooting machine guns
243.524	and firing mortars.
246.104	There's not a lot of places you can
246.104	put those skills in the civilian world.
249.675	(Laughter)
250.7	Emotionally, I struggled to find meaning.
253.103	In the military, everything has meaning.
255.088	Everything you do
255.088	is either steeped in tradition
257.365	or has a practical purpose.
258.717	You can't smoke in the field
260.094	because you don't want
260.094	to give away your position.
262.469	You don't touch your face --
262.469	you have to maintain
264.788	a personal level of health and hygiene.
266.694	"You face this way when ""Colors"" plays,"
268.544	out of respect for people
268.544	who went before you.
270.758	Walk this way, talk this way
270.758	because of this.
272.922	Your uniform is maintained to the inch.
274.826	How diligently you followed
274.826	those rules spoke volumes
277.343	about the kind of Marine you were.
279.002	Your rank said something
279.002	about your history
281.054	and the respect you had earned.
282.562	In the civilian world there's no rank.
284.418	Here you're just another body,
285.881	and I felt like I constantly had
285.881	to prove my worth all over again.
289.112	And the respect civilians were giving me
289.112	while I was in uniform
292.136	didn't exist when I was out of it.
293.786	There didn't seem to be a ...
295.563	a sense of community,
296.787	whereas in the military,
296.787	I felt this sense of community.
299.477	How often in the civilian world
301.748	are you put in a life-or-death situation
301.748	with your closest friends
305.006	and they constantly demonstrate
305.006	that they're not going to abandon you?
308.336	And meanwhile, at acting school ...
310.413	(Laughter)
312.895	I was really, for the first time,
314.593	discovering playwrights
314.593	and characters and plays
316.902	that had nothing to do with the military,
318.889	but were somehow describing
318.889	my military experience
321.268	in a way that before
321.268	to me was indescribable.
323.839	And I felt myself becoming less aggressive
326.254	as I was able to put words
326.254	to feelings for the first time
329.481	and realizing what
329.481	a valuable tool that was.
331.624	And when I was reflecting
331.624	on my time in the military,
334.128	I wasn't first thinking
334.128	on the stereotypical drills
336.563	and discipline and pain of it;
338.039	but rather, the small,
338.039	intimate human moments,
340.277	moments of great feeling:
341.634	friends going AWOL
341.634	because they missed their families,
344.283	friends getting divorced,
345.542	grieving together, celebrating together,
347.564	all within the backdrop of the military.
349.523	I saw my friends battling
349.523	these circumstances,
351.829	and I watched the anxiety
351.829	it produced in them and me,
354.884	not being able to express
354.884	our feelings about it.
358.026	The military and theater communities
358.026	are actually very similar.
361.098	You have a group of people
361.098	trying to accomplish a mission
363.847	greater than themselves;
363.847	it's not about you.
365.934	You have a role, you have to know
365.934	your role within that team.
368.926	Every team has a leader or director;
371.109	sometimes they're smart,
371.109	sometimes they're not.
373.683	You're forced to be intimate
373.683	with complete strangers
376.311	in a short amount of time;
377.62	the self-discipline, the self-maintenance.
380.132	I thought, how great would it be
380.132	to create a space
382.639	that combined these two seemingly
382.639	dissimilar communities,
385.99	that brought entertainment
385.99	to a group of people
388.249	that, considering their occupation,
390.368	could handle something
390.368	a bit more thought-provoking
392.836	than the typical mandatory-fun events
394.693	that I remember being
394.693	"""volun-told"" to go to in the military --"
397.778	(Laughter)
398.804	all well-intended but slightly
398.804	offensive events,
401.106	"like ""Win a Date with a San Diego"
401.106	"Chargers Cheerleader,"""
403.781	where you answer a question
403.781	about pop culture,
405.981	and if you get it right you win a date,
407.898	which was a chaperoned walk
407.898	around the parade deck
410.268	with this already married,
410.268	pregnant cheerleader --
412.683	(Laughter)
413.874	Nothing against cheerleaders,
413.874	I love cheerleaders.
416.278	The point is more, how great would it
416.278	be to have theater presented
419.414	through characters that were accessible
419.414	without being condescending.
422.662	So we started this nonprofit
422.662	called Arts in the Armed Forces,
425.591	where we tried to do that,
427.27	tried to join these two seemingly
427.27	dissimilar communities.
430.212	We pick a play or select monologues
430.212	from contemporary American plays
434.051	that are diverse in age and race
434.051	like a military audience is,
437.749	grab a group of incredible
437.749	theater-trained actors,
440.122	arm them with incredible material,
441.999	keep production value
441.999	as minimal as possible --
444.243	no sets, no costumes,
444.243	no lights, just reading it --
447.303	to throw all the emphasis on the language
449.806	and to show that theater can
449.806	be created at any setting.
452.545	It's a powerful thing,
453.749	getting in a room with complete strangers
456.659	and reminding ourselves of our humanity,
459.331	and that self-expression
459.331	is just as valuable a tool
461.752	as a rifle on your shoulder.
463.133	And for an organization like the military,
465.162	that prides itself on having
465.162	acronyms for acronyms,
468.113	you can get lost in the sauce
469.56	when it comes to explaining
469.56	a collective experience.
472.266	And I can think of no better community
474.134	to arm with a new means of self-expression
476.229	than those protecting our country.
478.275	We've gone all over
478.275	the United States and the world,
480.779	from Walter Reed in Bethesda, Maryland,
483.484	to Camp Pendleton,
483.484	to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait,
485.954	to USAG Bavaria,
487.687	on- and off-Broadway theaters in New York.
489.751	And for the performing artists we bring,
491.847	it's a window into a culture
493.539	they otherwise would not
493.539	have had exposure to.
495.723	And for the military, it's the exact same.
497.766	And in doing this for the past six years,
499.777	I'm always reminded
499.777	that acting is many things.
502.032	It's a craft, it's a political act,
502.032	it's a business, it's --
505.888	whatever adjective
505.888	is most applicable to you.
508.037	But it's also a service.
509.5	I didn't get to finish mine,
511.048	so whenever I get to be of service
512.704	to this ultimate service industry,
512.704	the military, for me, again --
516.005	there's not many things better than that.
518.076	Thank you.
519.428	(Applause)
524.04	We're going to be doing a piece
524.04	from Marco Ramirez,
527.988	"called ""I am not Batman."""
529.706	An incredible actor
529.706	and good friend of mine, Jesse Perez,
532.758	is going to be reading,
533.957	and Matt Johnson,
533.957	who I just met a couple hours ago.
536.465	They're doing it together
536.465	for the first time,
538.64	so we'll see how it goes.
539.902	Jesse Perez and Matt Johnson.
541.845	(Applause)
552.669	Jesse Perez: It's the middle of the night
554.66	and the sky is glowing
554.66	like mad, radioactive red.
556.994	And if you squint,
556.994	you can maybe see the moon
559.14	through a thick layer of cigarette smoke
559.14	and airplane exhaust
562.03	that covers the whole city,
563.345	like a mosquito net
563.345	that won't let the angels in.
565.667	(Drum beat)
566.731	And if you look up high enough,
568.241	you can see me standing
568.241	on the edge of an 87-story building.
571.702	And up there, a place for gargoyles
571.702	and broken clock towers
575.153	that have stayed still and dead
575.153	for maybe like 100 years,
578.153	up there is me.
579.688	(Beat)
580.742	And I'm frickin' Batman.
582.35	(Beat)
583.413	And I gots Batmobiles and batarangs
585.602	and frickin' bat caves, like, for real.
588.021	And all it takes is a broom closet
589.739	or a back room or a fire escape,
591.707	and Danny's hand-me-down jeans are gone.
594.722	And my navy blue polo shirt,
596.642	the one that looks kinda good on me
596.642	but has that hole on it near the butt
600.143	from when it got snagged
600.143	on the chain-link fence behind Arturo's
603.191	but it isn't even a big deal
603.191	because I tuck that part in
605.907	and it's, like, all good.
607.15	That blue polo shirt -- it's gone, too!
609.091	And I get like, like ... transformational.
612.122	(Beat)
613.434	And nobody pulls out a belt
613.434	and whips Batman for talkin' back.
616.793	(Beat)
617.834	Or for not talkin' back.
619.278	And nobody calls Batman simple
621.626	or stupid
623.199	or skinny.
624.784	And nobody fires Batman's brother
624.784	from the Eastern Taxi Company
628.027	'cause they was making cutbacks, neither.
630.083	'Cause they got nothing but respect.
631.996	And not like afraid-respect,
634.155	just, like, respect-respect.
636.558	(Laughter)
637.583	'Cause nobody's afraid of you.
639.114	'Cause Batman doesn't mean nobody no harm.
641.272	(Beat)
642.297	Ever.
642.297	(Double beat)
643.875	'Cause all Batman really wants
643.875	to do is save people
646.336	and maybe pay abuela's bills one day
648.107	and die happy.
649.282	And maybe get, like, mad-famous for real.
651.502	(Laughter)
652.537	Oh -- and kill the Joker.
653.898	(Drum roll)
655.382	Tonight, like most nights, I'm all alone.
658.064	And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'
660.281	like a eagle
661.487	or like a --
662.681	no, yeah, like a eagle.
664.414	(Laughter)
665.439	And my cape is flapping in the wind
665.439	cause it's frickin' long
668.281	and my pointy ears are on,
669.719	and that mask that covers like half
669.719	my face is on, too,
672.573	and I got, like, bulletproof stuff
672.573	all in my chest so no one can hurt me.
676.073	And nobody -- nobody! --
677.811	is gonna come between Batman ...
679.874	and justice.
681.077	(Drums)
681.077	(Laughter)
682.903	From where I am,
684.435	I can hear everything.
686.046	(Silence)
687.236	Somewhere in the city,
688.42	there's a old lady picking
688.42	Styrofoam leftovers up out of a trash can
691.66	and she's putting a piece
691.66	of sesame chicken someone spit out
694.534	into her own mouth.
695.869	And somewhere there's a doctor
695.869	with a wack haircut in a black lab coat
699.202	trying to find a cure for the diseases
701.084	that are gonna make us
701.084	all extinct for real one day.
704.066	And somewhere there's a man,
705.45	a man in a janitor's uniform,
706.871	stumbling home drunk and dizzy
708.828	after spending half his paycheck
708.828	on 40-ounce bottles of twist-off beer,
712.604	and the other half on a four-hour visit
712.604	to some lady's house
715.572	on a street where the lights
715.572	have all been shot out
718.021	by people who'd rather do
718.021	what they do in this city in the dark.
721.078	And half a block away from janitor man,
723.028	there's a group of good-for-nothings
723.028	who don't know no better,
725.966	waiting for janitor man
725.966	with rusted bicycle chains
728.514	and imitation Louisville Sluggers,
730.207	and if they don't find a cent on him,
732.013	which they won't,
733.188	they'll just pound at him till the muscles
733.188	in their arms start burning,
736.57	till there's no more teeth to crack out.
738.667	But they don't count on me.
740.664	They don't count on no Dark Knight,
742.935	with a stomach full of grocery-store
742.935	brand macaroni and cheese
745.953	and cut-up Vienna sausages.
747.566	(Laughter)
748.591	'Cause they'd rather believe
748.591	I don't exist.
751.893	And from 87 stories up, I can hear
751.893	one of the good-for-nothings say,
755.53	"""Gimme the cash!"" -- real fast like that,"
757.855	"just, ""Gimme me the fuckin' cash!"""
759.622	And I see janitor man mumble something
759.622	in drunk language and turn pale,
763.199	and from 87 stories up,
764.4	I can hear his stomach trying
764.4	to hurl its way out his Dickies.
767.532	So I swoop down, like, mad-fast
769.437	"and I'm like darkness, I'm like, ""Swoosh!"""
772.476	And I throw a batarang
772.476	at the one naked lightbulb.
774.955	(Cymbal)
776.018	"And they're all like, ""Whoa, muthafucker!"
778.17	"Who just turned out the lights?"""
779.785	(Laughter)
780.81	"""What's that over there?"""
780.81	"""What?"""
782.503	"""Gimme me what you got, old man!"""
784.12	"""Did anybody hear that?"""
785.31	"""Hear what? There ain't nothing."
785.31	"No, really -- there ain't no bat!"""
789.174	But then ...
790.425	one out of the three good-for-nothings
790.425	gets it to the head -- pow!
793.928	And number two swings blindly
793.928	into the dark cape before him,
796.809	but before his fist hits anything,
798.642	I grab a trash can lid and --
800.57	right in the gut!
801.781	And number one comes
801.781	back with the jump kick,
803.92	but I know judo karate, too,
803.92	so I'm like --
806.575	(Drums)
810.38	Twice!
811.555	(Drums)
812.58	(Laughter)
813.829	(Drums)
815.305	But before I can do any more damage,
817.089	"suddenly we all hear a ""click-click."""
820.217	And suddenly everything gets quiet.
823.049	And the one good-for-nothing left standing
825.089	grips a handgun and aims it straight up,
827.05	like he's holding Jesus hostage,
828.655	like he's threatening maybe
828.655	to blow a hole in the moon.
831.564	And the good-for-nothing
831.564	who got it to the head,
833.86	who tried to jump-kick me,
835.152	and the other good-for-nothing
835.152	who got it in the gut,
837.669	is both scrambling back away
837.669	from the dark figure before 'em.
840.574	And the drunk man, the janitor man,
842.281	is huddled in a corner,
842.281	praying to Saint Anthony
844.568	'cause that's the only one
844.568	he could remember.
846.708	(Double beat)
847.733	And there's me:
849.31	eyes glowing white,
850.704	cape blowing softly in the wind.
852.735	(Beat)
853.76	Bulletproof chest heaving,
855.281	my heart beating right through it
855.281	in a Morse code for:
857.845	"""Fuck with me"
859.02	just once
860.195	come on
861.37	"just try."""
862.83	And the one good-for-nothing
862.83	left standing,
864.934	the one with the handgun --
866.273	yeah, he laughs.
867.448	And he lowers his arm.
868.654	And he points it at me
869.988	and gives the moon a break.
871.463	And he aims it right
871.463	between my pointy ears,
873.66	like goal posts and he's special teams.
877.444	And janitor man is still
877.444	calling Saint Anthony,
880.137	but he ain't pickin' up.
882.277	And for a second,
883.979	it seems like ...
887.04	maybe I'm gonna lose.
890.899	Nah!
892.081	(Drums)
893.121	Shoot! Shoot! Fwa-ka-ka!
894.33	"""Don't kill me, man!"""
895.505	Snap! Wrist crack! Neck! Slash!
897.487	Skin meets acid:
897.487	"""Ahhhhhhh!"""
901.494	And he's on the floor
902.756	and I'm standing over him
903.978	and I got the gun in my hands now
905.911	and I hate guns, I hate holding 'em
905.911	'cause I'm Batman.
908.599	And, asterisk:
909.801	Batman don't like guns 'cause his parents
909.801	got iced by guns a long time ago.
913.383	But for just a second,
914.622	my eyes glow white,
915.964	and I hold this thing
917.147	for I could speak to the good-for-nothing
919.154	in a language he maybe understands.
920.924	Click-click!
922.495	(Beat)
923.532	And the good-for-nothings
923.532	become good-for-disappearing
926.121	into whatever toxic waste, chemical
926.121	sludge shithole they crawled out of.
930.784	And it's just me and janitor man.
933.555	And I pick him up,
935.049	and I wipe sweat and cheap perfume
935.049	off his forehead.
938.206	And he begs me not to hurt him
939.666	and I grab him tight
939.666	by his janitor-man shirt collar,
942.22	and I pull him to my face
943.531	and he's taller than me
943.531	but the cape helps,
945.635	so he listens when I look him
945.635	straight in the eyes.
948.052	And I say two words to him:
950.467	"""Go home."""
953.282	And he does,
954.552	checking behind his shoulder
954.552	every 10 feet.
957.044	And I swoosh from building
957.044	to building on his way there
959.657	'cause I know where he lives.
961.085	And I watch his hands tremble
961.085	as he pulls out his key chain
963.913	and opens the door to his building.
965.646	And I'm back in bed
966.941	before he even walks in
966.941	through the front door.
969.548	And I hear him turn on the faucet
971.191	and pour himself a glass
971.191	of warm tap water.
973.796	And he puts the glass back in the sink.
976.399	And I hear his footsteps.
978.63	And they get slower
978.63	as they get to my room.
981.758	And he creaks my door open,
981.758	like, mad-slow.
985.953	And he takes a step in,
987.805	which he never does.
989.677	(Beat)
991.167	And he's staring off into nowhere,
992.821	his face, the color
992.821	of sidewalks in summer.
995.51	And I act like I'm just waking up
997.115	"and I say, ""Ah, what's up, Pop?"""
1000.452	And janitor man says nothing to me.
1003.753	But I see in the dark,
1004.938	I see his arms go limp
1006.335	and his head turns back, like, towards me.
1008.473	And he lifts it for I can see his face,
1010.873	for I could see his eyes.
1012.763	And his cheeks is drippin',
1012.763	but not with sweat.
1015.704	And he just stands there breathing,
1017.509	like he remembers my eyes glowing white,
1019.965	like he remembers my bulletproof chest,
1023.513	like he remembers he's my pop.
1029.575	And for a long time I don't say nothin'.
1034.583	And he turns around, hand on the doorknob.
1036.633	And he ain't looking my way,
1038.085	but I hear him mumble two words to me:
1042.253	"""I'm sorry."""
1046.317	And I lean over, and I open
1046.317	my window just a crack.
1050.697	If you look up high enough,
1053.036	you could see me.
1055.519	And from where I am --
1057.641	(Cymbals)
1059.692	I could hear everything.
1064.076	(Applause)
1072.544	Thank you.
1073.801	(Applause)
