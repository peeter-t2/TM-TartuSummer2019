13.457	Our world has many superheroes.
16.454	But they have the worst of
16.454	all superpowers: invisibility.
22.012	For example, the catadores,
24.349	workers who collect recyclable 
24.349	materials for a living.
28.462	Catadores emerged from 
28.462	social inequality, unemployment,
33.122	and the abundance of solid waste
36.141	from the deficiency of the 
36.141	waste collection system.
40.74	Catadores provide a heavy, 
40.74	honest and essential work
46.5	that benefits the entire population.
46.5	But they are not acknowledged for it.
51.441	Here in Brazil, they collect 90 percent
51.441	of all the waste that's actually recycled.
59.442	Most of the catadores work independently,
62.164	picking waste from the streets and 
62.164	selling to junk yards at very low prices.
67.575	They may collect over 300 kilos
70.97	in their bags, shopping carts, 
70.97	bicycles and carroças.
76.505	Carroças are carts
76.505	built from wood or metal
79.351	and found in several streets in Brazil,
82.169	much like graffiti and street art.
84.792	And this is how I first met these 
84.792	marginalized superheroes.
89.743	I am a graffiti artist and activist
92.023	and my art is social, environmental 
92.023	and political in nature.
98.208	In 2007, I took my work beyond walls
98.208	and onto the carroças,
103.37	as a new urban support for my message.
106.324	But at this time, 
106.324	giving voice to the catadores.
110.141	By adding art and humor to the cause,
110.141	it became more appealing,
115.482	which helped call attention 
115.482	to the catadores
118.05	and improve their self-esteem.
119.975	And also, they are famous now 
119.975	on the streets, on mass media and social.
125.256	So, the thing is,
127.945	I plunged into this universe 
127.945	and have not stopped working since.
131.902	I have painted over 200 
131.902	carroças in many cities
135.336	and have been invited to do exhibitions 
135.336	and trips worldwide.
139.301	And then I realized that catadores,
139.301	in their invisibility,
143.953	are not exclusive to Brazil.
145.981	I met them in Argentina, Chile,
150.505	Bolivia, South Africa, Turkey
155.079	and even in developed countries such
155.079	as the United States and Japan.
160.104	And this was when I realized that I needed
160.104	to have more people join the cause
164.82	because it's a big challenge.
166.653	And then, I created a collaborative 
166.653	movement called Pimp My Carroça --
172.455	(Laughter) -- which is 
172.455	a large crowdfunded event.
176.142	Thank you.
177.169	(Applause).
180.868	So Pimp My Carroça is a large 
180.868	crowdfunded event
184.84	to help catadores and their carroças.
187.576	Catadores are assisted by well-being 
187.576	professionals and healthcare,
191.635	like physicians, dentists, podiatrists, 
191.635	hair stylists, massage therapists
198.393	and much more.
199.698	But also, they also receive safety shirts,
199.698	gloves, raincoats and eyeglasses
204.667	to see in high-definition the city,
206.762	while their carroças are renovated
206.762	by our incredible volunteers.
211.78	And then they receive safety items, too:
214.189	reflective tapes, horns and mirrors.
216.554	Then, finally, painted by a street artist
219.119	and become part of part of this huge, 
219.119	amazing mobile art exhibition.
224.42	Pimp My Carroça took to the streets
224.42	of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba.
230.208	But to meet the demand in other cities,
230.208	including outside of Brazil,
234.907	we have created Pimpx,
234.907	which is inspired by TEDx,
240.092	and it's a simplified, do-it-yourself,
240.092	crowdfunded edition of Pimp My Carroça.
246.026	So now everybody can join.
249.016	In two years, over 170 catadores,
257.15	and more than 1,000 donors
259.126	have been involved in the 
259.126	Pimp My Carroça movement,
262.001	whose actions have even been used
262.001	in teaching recycling at a local school.
268.095	So catadores are leaving 
268.095	invisibility behind
272.108	and becoming increasingly
272.108	respected and valued.
275.662	Because of their pimped carroças,
275.662	they are able to fight back to prejudice,
280.219	increase their income and 
280.219	their interaction with society.
284.121	So now, I'd like to challenge you 
284.121	to start looking at and acknowledging
289.043	the catadores and other 
289.043	invisible superheroes from your city.
293.065	Try to see the world as one, 
293.065	without boundaries or frontiers.
298.134	Believe it or not,
299.764	there are over 20 million 
299.764	catadores worldwide.
305.785	So next time you see one,
308.405	recognize them as a vital part
308.405	of our society.
313.066	Muito obrigado, thank you.
315.71	(Applause).
