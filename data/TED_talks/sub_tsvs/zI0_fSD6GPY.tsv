15.26	Good afternoon.
16.26	If you have followed
18.26	diplomatic news in the past weeks,
20.26	you may have heard of a kind of crisis
22.26	between China and the U.S.
24.26	regarding cyberattacks
26.26	against the American company Google.
28.26	Many things have been said about this.
30.26	Some people have called a cyberwar
32.26	what may actually be
34.26	just a spy operation --
36.26	and obviously, a quite mishandled one.
38.26	However, this episode reveals
41.26	the growing anxiety in the Western world
43.26	regarding these emerging cyber weapons.
46.26	It so happens that these weapons are dangerous.
48.26	They're of a new nature:
50.26	they could lead the world
52.26	into a digital conflict
54.26	that could turn into an armed struggle.
56.26	These virtual weapons can also destroy the physical world.
61.26	In 1982, in the middle of the Cold War
64.26	in Soviet Siberia,
66.26	a pipeline exploded with a burst of 3 kilotons,
70.26	the equivalent of a fourth of the Hiroshima bomb.
72.26	Now we know today -- this was revealed
74.26	by Thomas Reed,
76.26	Ronald Reagan's former U.S. Air Force Secretary --
78.26	this explosion was actually the result
81.26	of a CIA sabotage operation,
83.26	in which they had managed
85.26	to infiltrate the IT management systems
87.26	of that pipeline.
89.26	More recently, the U.S. government revealed
92.26	that in September 2008, more than 3 million people
95.26	in the state of Espirito Santo in Brazil
98.26	were plunged into darkness,
100.26	victims of a blackmail operation from cyber pirates.
105.26	Even more worrying for the Americans,
107.26	in December 2008 the holiest of holies,
110.26	the IT systems of CENTCOM,
112.26	the central command
114.26	managing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,
117.26	may have been infiltrated by hackers
119.26	who used these:
122.26	plain but infected USB keys.
124.26	And with these keys, they may have been able
126.26	to get inside CENTCOM's systems,
128.26	to see and hear everything,
130.26	and maybe even infect some of them.
132.26	As a result, the Americans take the threat very seriously.
134.26	I'll quote General James Cartwright,
136.26	Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
138.26	who says in a report to Congress
140.26	that cyberattacks could be as powerful as
143.26	weapons of mass destruction.
146.26	Moreover, the Americans have decided
148.26	to spend over 30 billion dollars
150.26	in the next five years
151.76	to build up their cyberwar capabilities.
154.26	And across the world today, we see
156.26	a sort of cyber arms race,
159.26	with cyberwar units
161.26	built up by countries like North Korea
163.26	or even Iran.
164.26	Yet, what you'll never hear
166.26	from spokespeople
168.26	from the Pentagon or the French Department of Defence
171.26	is that the question isn't really
173.26	who's the enemy, but actually
175.26	the very nature of cyber weapons.
178.26	And to understand why, we must look at how,
180.26	through the ages, military technologies
183.26	have maintained or destroyed
185.26	world peace.
188.26	For example,
190.26	if we'd had TEDxParis
193.26	we would have talked about the military innovation of the day --
196.26	the massive Vauban-style fortifications --
199.26	and we could have predicted
201.26	a period of stability in the world or in Europe.
204.26	which was indeed the case in Europe
207.26	between 1650 and 1750.
209.26	Similarly, if we'd had this talk
215.26	how the rise of nuclear weapons,
217.26	and the threat of mutually assured destruction they imply,
221.26	prevents a direct fight between the two superpowers.
225.26	However, if we'd had this talk 60 years ago,
227.26	we would have seen how the emergence
230.26	of new aircraft and tank technologies,
233.26	which give the advantage to the attacker,
236.26	make the Blitzkrieg doctrine very credible
239.26	and thus create the possibility of war in Europe.
242.26	So military technologies
244.26	can influence the course of the world,
246.26	can make or break world peace --
248.26	and there lies the issue with cyber weapons.
250.26	The first issue:
252.26	Imagine a potential enemy announcing
255.26	they're building a cyberwar unit,
257.26	but only for their country's defense.
259.26	Okay, but what distinguishes it
262.26	from an offensive unit?
264.26	It gets even more complicated
266.26	when the doctrines of use become ambiguous.
270.26	Just 3 years ago, both the U.S. and France
274.26	were saying they were investing militarily in cyberspace,
278.26	strictly to defend their IT systems.
281.26	But today both countries say
284.26	the best defense is to attack.
286.26	And so, they're joining China,
288.26	whose doctrine of use for 15 years has been
292.26	both defensive and offensive.
295.26	The second issue:
297.26	Your country could be under cyberattack
301.26	with entire regions plunged into total darkness,
304.26	and you may not even know
306.26	who's attacking you.
308.26	Cyber weapons have this peculiar feature:
310.06	they can be used
311.56	without leaving traces.
313.26	This gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker,
315.26	because the defender
317.26	doesn't know who to fight back against.
319.26	And if the defender retaliates against the wrong adversary,
321.26	they risk making one more enemy
324.26	and ending up diplomatically isolated.
326.26	This issue isn't just theoretical.
328.26	In May 2007, Estonia was the victim of cyberattacks,
330.26	that damaged its communication
333.26	and banking systems.
335.26	Estonia accused Russia.
337.26	But NATO, though it defends Estonia,
339.26	reacted very prudently. Why?
341.26	Because NATO couldn't be 100% sure
343.26	that the Kremlin was indeed behind these attacks.
348.26	So to sum up, on the one hand,
351.26	when a possible enemy announces
353.26	they're building a cyberwar unit,
355.26	you don't know whether it's for attack
357.26	or defense.
358.26	On the other hand,
359.26	we know that these weapons give an advantage to attacking.
363.26	In a major article published in 1978,
366.26	Professor Robert Jervis of Columbia University in New York
368.26	described a model to understand
370.26	how conflicts could arise.
372.26	In this context,
375.26	when you don't know if the potential enemy
377.26	is preparing for defense or attack,
380.26	and if the weapons give an advantage to attacking,
382.26	then this environment is
384.26	most likely to spark a conflict.
388.26	This is the environment that's being created
390.26	by cyber weapons today,
392.26	and historically it was the environment in Europe
395.26	at the onset of World War I.
399.26	So cyber weapons
401.26	are dangerous by nature,
403.26	but in addition, they're emerging
406.26	in a much more unstable environment.
408.26	If you remember the Cold War,
410.26	it was a very hard game,
412.26	but a stable one played only by two players,
414.26	which allowed for some coordination between the two superpowers.
417.26	Today we're moving to a multipolar world
422.26	in which coordination is much more complicated,
423.26	as we have seen at Copenhagen.
426.26	And this coordination may become even trickier
429.26	with the introduction of cyber weapons.
432.26	Why? Because no nation
434.26	knows for sure whether its neighbor
437.26	is about to attack.
439.26	So nations may live under the threat
441.26	of what Nobel Prize winner Thomas Schelling
444.26	"called the ""reciprocal fear of surprise attack,"""
446.26	as I don't know if my neighbor
448.26	is about to attack me or not --
450.26	I may never know --
452.26	so I might take the upper hand
454.26	and attack first.
457.26	Just last week,
459.26	in a New York Times article dated January 26, 2010,
463.26	it was revealed for the first time that
465.26	officials at the National Security Agency
468.26	were considering the possibility of preemptive attacks
472.26	in cases where the U.S. was about
475.26	to be cyberattacked.
478.26	And these preemptive attacks
480.26	might not just remain
481.26	in cyberspace.
485.26	In May 2009, General Kevin Chilton,
490.26	commander of the U.S. nuclear forces,
493.26	stated that in the event of cyberattacks against the U.S.,
498.26	all options would be on the table.
501.26	Cyber weapons do not replace
503.26	conventional or nuclear weapons --
505.26	they just add a new layer to the existing system of terror.
510.26	But in doing so, they also add their own risk
513.26	of triggering a conflict --
515.26	as we've just seen, a very important risk --
517.26	and a risk we may have to confront
519.26	with a collective security solution
522.26	which includes all of us:
524.26	European allies, NATO members,
526.26	our American friends and allies,
528.26	our other Western allies,
530.26	and maybe, by forcing their hand a little,
532.26	our Russian and Chinese partners.
535.26	The information technologies
537.26	JoÃ«l de Rosnay was talking about,
538.76	which were historically born from military research,
541.26	are today on the verge of developing
543.26	an offensive capability of destruction,
546.26	which could tomorrow, if we're not careful,
550.26	completely destroy world peace.
553.26	Thank you.
555.26	(Applause)
