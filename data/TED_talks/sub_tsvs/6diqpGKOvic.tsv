13.112	Hi.
14.461	Let me ask the audience a question:
16.831	Did you ever lie as a child?
19.05	If you did, could you please
19.05	raise your hand?
23.145	Wow! This is the most honest
23.145	group of people I've ever met.
26.623	(Laughter)
28.604	So for the last 20 years,
30.337	I've been studying
30.337	how children learn to tell lies.
33.776	And today, I'm going to share with you
36.104	some of the discoveries we have made.
38.624	But to begin, I'm going to tell you
38.624	a story from Mr. Richard Messina,
43.573	who is my friend and an elementary
43.573	school principal.
47.266	He got a phone call one day.
51.279	The caller says,
52.454	"""Mr. Messina, my son Johnny"
52.454	will not come to school today
56.36	"because he's sick."""
58.498	Mr. Messina asks,
60.258	"""Who am I speaking to, please?"""
62.788	And the caller says,
64.302	"""I am my father."""
65.991	(Laughter)
70.227	So this story --
71.933	(Laughter)
73.489	sums up very nicely
73.489	three common beliefs we have
77.823	about children and lying.
80.14	One, children only come to tell lies
84.795	after entering elementary school.
87.552	Two, children are poor liars.
89.887	We adults can easily detect their lies.
92.768	And three, if children lie
92.768	at a very young age,
96.83	there must be some
96.83	character flaws with them,
99.703	and they are going to become
99.703	pathological liars for life.
104.72	Well, it turns out
106.938	all of the three beliefs are wrong.
110.617	We have been playing guessing games
113.351	with children all over the world.
115.457	Here is an example.
116.967	So in this game, we asked children
116.967	to guess the numbers on the cards.
121.958	And we tell them if they win the game,
124.86	they are going to get a big prize.
127.525	But in the middle of the game,
129.026	we make an excuse and leave the room.
133.763	And before we leave the room,
135.721	we tell them not to peek at the cards.
139.518	Of course,
140.958	we have hidden cameras in the room
143.143	to watch their every move.
146.216	Because the desire
146.216	to win the game is so strong,
149.657	more than 90 percent of children will peek
153.167	as soon as we leave the room.
154.628	(Laughter)
157.044	The crucial question is:
159.054	When we return and ask the children
161.826	whether or not they have peeked,
164.159	will the children who peeked confess
167.235	or lie about their transgression?
171.525	We found that regardless
171.525	of gender, country, religion,
176.934	at two years of age,
	about their transgression.
184.972	At three years of age,
	tell the truth.
191.302	At four years of age,
193.225	more than 80 percent lie.
196.334	And after four years of age,
198.809	most children lie.
201.18	So as you can see,
202.567	lying is really a typical part
202.567	of development.
206.054	And some children begin to tell lies
208.868	as young as two years of age.
212.438	So now, let's take a closer look
212.438	at the younger children.
217.336	Why do some but not all
217.336	young children lie?
222.184	In cooking, you need good ingredients
225.537	to cook good food.
227.793	And good lying requires
227.793	two key ingredients.
233.109	The first key ingredient
233.109	is theory of mind,
237.243	or the mind-reading ability.
239.768	Mind reading is the ability to know
241.87	that different people have
241.87	different knowledge about the situation
246.502	and the ability to differentiate
246.502	between what I know
250.327	and what you know.
251.914	Mind reading is important for lying
254.185	because the basis of lying is that I know
258.056	you don't know
259.231	what I know.
260.406	Therefore, I can lie to you.
263.07	The second key ingredient
263.07	for good lying is self-control.
267.704	It is the ability to control your speech,
267.704	your facial expression
272.351	and your body language,
273.915	so that you can tell a convincing lie.
276.938	And we found that those young children
280.688	who have more advanced mind-reading
280.688	and self-control abilities
285.568	tell lies earlier
287.63	and are more sophisticated liars.
291.887	As it turns out, these two abilities
291.887	are also essential for all of us
297.53	to function well in our society.
300.848	In fact, deficits in mind-reading
300.848	and self-control abilities
305.207	are associated with serious
305.207	developmental problems,
308.79	such as ADHD and autism.
313.893	So if you discover your two-year-old
313.893	is telling his or her first lie,
319.094	instead of being alarmed,
321.102	you should celebrate --
322.618	(Laughter)
324.164	because it signals that your child
324.164	has arrived at a new milestone
329.918	of typical development.
333.085	Now, are children poor liars?
336.878	Do you think you can easily
336.878	detect their lies?
340.745	Would you like to give it a try?
342.921	Yes? OK.
344.425	So I'm going to show you two videos.
347.024	In the videos,
348.199	the children are going to respond
348.199	to a researcher's question,
351.28	"""Did you peek?"""
352.786	So try to tell me
354.364	which child is lying
355.786	and which child is telling the truth.
358.272	Here's child number one.
360.991	Are you ready?
363.006	(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.
365.619	Kang Lee: And this is child number two.
369.501	(Video) Adult: Did you peek? Child: No.
373.296	KL: OK, if you think
373.296	child number one is lying,
376.907	please raise your hand.
380.401	And if you think child number two
380.401	is lying, please raise your hand.
385.593	OK, so as a matter of fact,
388.091	child number one is telling the truth,
391.052	child number two is lying.
394.124	Looks like many of you are terrible
394.124	detectors of children's lies.
397.378	(Laughter)
399.88	Now, we have played similar kinds of games
403.288	with many, many adults
403.288	from all walks of life.
408.714	And we show them many videos.
411.347	In half of the videos, the children lied.
413.92	In the other half of the videos,
413.92	the children told the truth.
418.529	And let's find out
418.529	how these adults performed.
422.319	Because there are as many liars
422.319	as truth tellers,
426.198	if you guess randomly,
428.621	there's a 50 percent chance
428.621	you're going to get it right.
432.715	So if your accuracy is around 50 percent,
436.333	it means you are a terrible detector
436.333	of children's lies.
440.29	So let's start with undergrads
440.29	and law school students,
444.843	who typically have
444.843	limited experience with children.
450.038	No, they cannot detect children's lies.
452.024	Their performance is around chance.
454.262	Now how about social workers
454.262	and child-protection lawyers,
459.515	who work with children on a daily basis?
462.213	Can they detect children's lies?
465.624	No, they cannot.
466.799	(Laughter)
467.868	What about judges,
469.364	customs officers
471.188	and police officers,
473.07	who deal with liars on a daily basis?
475.737	Can they detect children's lies?
478.8	No, they cannot.
480.43	What about parents?
481.64	Can parents detect other children's lies?
485.898	No, they cannot.
487.821	What about, can parents
487.821	detect their own children's lies?
493.208	No, they cannot.
494.433	(Laughter) (Applause)
497.933	So now you may ask
500.504	why children's lies
500.504	are so difficult to detect.
504.958	Let me illustrate this
504.958	with my own son, Nathan.
507.994	This is his facial expression
510.187	when he lies.
511.595	(Laughter)
513.825	So when children lie,
515.451	their facial expression
515.451	is typically neutral.
519.123	However, behind this neutral expression,
522.607	the child is actually experiencing
522.607	a lot of emotions,
525.957	such as fear, guilt, shame
529.836	and maybe a little bit of liar's delight.
532.956	(Laughter)
535.682	Unfortunately, such emotions
535.682	are either fleeting or hidden.
540.546	Therefore, it's mostly invisible to us.
543.669	So in the last five years,
545.052	we have been trying to figure out a way
545.052	to reveal these hidden emotions.
548.972	Then we made a discovery.
551.273	We know that underneath our facial skin,
554.482	there's a rich network of blood vessels.
557.9	When we experience different emotions,
560.341	our facial blood flow changes subtly.
563.613	And these changes are regulated
563.613	by the autonomic system
567.585	that is beyond our conscious control.
570.159	By looking at facial blood flow changes,
574.006	we can reveal people's hidden emotions.
577.229	Unfortunately, such emotion-related
577.229	facial blood flow changes
582.031	are too subtle to detect by our naked eye.
585.632	So to help us reveal
585.632	people's facial emotions,
589.424	we have developed a new imaging technology
592.482	"we call ""transdermal optical imaging."""
596.679	To do so, we use a regular
596.679	video camera to record people
600.656	when they experience
600.656	various hidden emotions.
604.385	And then, using our image
604.385	processing technology,
608.503	we can extract transdermal images
608.503	of facial blood flow changes.
616.475	By looking at transdermal video images,
620.771	now we can easily see
623.737	facial blood flow changes associated
623.737	with the various hidden emotions.
629.944	And using this technology,
631.756	we can now reveal the hidden emotions
631.756	associated with lying,
636.448	and therefore detect people's lies.
639.382	We can do so noninvasively,
641.845	remotely, inexpensively,
644.408	with an accuracy at about 85 percent,
648.092	which is far better than chance level.
651.1	And in addition, we discovered
651.1	a Pinocchio effect.
656.336	No, not this Pinocchio effect.
658.415	(Laughter)
659.446	This is the real Pinocchio effect.
661.592	When people lie,
663.033	the facial blood flow
663.033	on the cheeks decreases,
666.836	and the facial blood flow
666.836	on the nose increases.
671.379	Of course, lying is not the only situation
674.91	that will evoke our hidden emotions.
677.782	So then we asked ourselves,
679.68	in addition to detecting lies,
682.051	how can our technology be used?
685.027	One application is in education.
688.597	For example, using this technology,
688.597	we can help this mathematics teacher
693.282	to identify the student in his classroom
696.213	who may experience high anxiety
696.213	about the topic he's teaching
700.982	so that he can help him.
703.337	And also we can use this in health care.
706.101	For example, every day I Skype my parents,
709.493	who live thousands of miles away.
712.178	And using this technology,
714.023	I can not only find out
714.023	what's going on in their lives
717.529	but also simultaneously monitor
717.529	their heart rate, their stress level,
723.855	their mood and whether or not
723.855	they are experiencing pain.
727.839	And perhaps in the future,
729.673	their risks for heart attack
729.673	or hypertension.
733.701	And you may ask:
735.472	Can we use this also to reveal
735.472	politicians' emotions?
740.977	(Laughter)
742.541	For example, during a debate.
745.22	Well, the answer is yes.
747.167	Using TV footage,
749.135	we could detect
749.135	the politicians' heart rate,
753.205	mood and stress,
755.275	and perhaps in the future,
755.275	whether or not they are lying to us.
759.495	We can also use this
759.495	in marketing research,
762.515	for example, to find out
764.39	whether or not people like
764.39	certain consumer products.
769.229	We can even use it in dating.
771.904	So for example,
773.088	if your date is smiling at you,
775.706	this technology can help you to determine
778.524	whether she actually likes you
781.155	or she is just trying to be nice to you.
783.864	And in this case,
785.583	she is just trying to be nice to you.
787.483	(Laughter)
791.244	So transdermal optical imaging technology
794.977	is at a very early stage of development.
797.579	Many new applications will come about
797.579	that we don't know today.
802.293	However, one thing I know for sure
805.095	is that lying will never
805.095	be the same again.
808.533	Thank you very much.
809.715	Xiè xie.
811.063	(Applause)
