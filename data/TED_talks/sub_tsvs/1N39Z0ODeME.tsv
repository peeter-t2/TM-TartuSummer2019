12.838	Cancer affects all of us --
15.045	especially the ones that come
15.045	back over and over again,
18.436	the highly invasive
18.436	and drug-resistant ones,
21.456	the ones that defy medical treatment,
23.859	even when we throw our best drugs at them.
27.247	Engineering at the molecular level,
30.191	working at the smallest of scales,
32.863	can provide exciting new ways
35.41	to fight the most aggressive
35.41	forms of cancer.
39.26	Cancer is a very clever disease.
42.346	There are some forms of cancer,
43.947	which, fortunately, we've learned
43.947	how to address relatively well
48.706	with known and established
48.706	drugs and surgery.
52.627	But there are some forms of cancer
54.628	that don't respond to these approaches,
56.884	and the tumor survives or comes back,
59.536	even after an onslaught of drugs.
62.053	We can think of these
62.053	very aggressive forms of cancer
66.071	as kind of supervillains in a comic book.
69.455	They're clever, they're adaptable,
72.184	and they're very good at staying alive.
75.744	And, like most supervillains these days,
78.996	their superpowers come
78.996	from a genetic mutation.
84.74	The genes that are modified
84.74	inside these tumor cells
87.706	can enable and encode for new
87.706	and unimagined modes of survival,
92.997	allowing the cancer cell to live through
95.496	even our best chemotherapy treatments.
98.789	One example is a trick
98.789	in which a gene allows a cell,
103.32	even as the drug approaches the cell,
106.39	to push the drug out,
109.85	before the drug can have any effect.
112.047	Imagine -- the cell effectively
112.047	spits out the drug.
116.393	This is just one example
116.393	of the many genetic tricks
119.347	in the bag of our supervillain, cancer.
121.971	All due to mutant genes.
124.717	So, we have a supervillain
124.717	with incredible superpowers.
129.462	And we need a new and powerful
129.462	mode of attack.
133.704	Actually, we can turn off a gene.
137.328	The key is a set of molecules
137.328	known as siRNA.
141.143	siRNA are short sequences of genetic code
145.253	that guide a cell to block a certain gene.
148.982	Each siRNA molecule
148.982	can turn off a specific gene
152.581	inside the cell.
155.292	For many years since its discovery,
157.337	scientists have been very excited
159.311	about how we can apply
159.311	these gene blockers in medicine.
163.216	But, there is a problem.
164.958	siRNA works well inside the cell.
167.854	But if it gets exposed to the enzymes
170.872	that reside in our bloodstream
170.872	or our tissues,
173.396	it degrades within seconds.
175.769	It has to be packaged, protected
175.769	through its journey through the body
180.109	on its way to the final target
180.109	inside the cancer cell.
183.74	So, here's our strategy.
186.468	First, we'll dose the cancer cell
186.468	with siRNA, the gene blocker,
190.295	and silence those survival genes,
191.915	and then we'll whop it with a chemo drug.
194.501	But how do we carry that out?
196.764	Using molecular engineering,
199.705	we can actually design a superweapon
203.648	that can travel through the bloodstream.
205.923	It has to be tiny enough
205.923	to get through the bloodstream,
208.943	it's got to be small enough
208.943	to penetrate the tumor tissue,
212.368	and it's got to be tiny enough
212.368	to be taken up inside the cancer cell.
217.049	To do this job well,
218.675	it has to be about one one-hundredth
218.675	the size of a human hair.
224.224	Let's take a closer look
224.224	at how we can build this nanoparticle.
229.146	First, let's start
229.146	with the nanoparticle core.
231.567	It's a tiny capsule that contains
231.567	the chemotherapy drug.
236.089	This is the poison that will
236.089	actually end the tumor cell's life.
240.152	Around this core, we'll wrap a very thin,
243.961	nanometers-thin blanket of siRNA.
246.818	This is our gene blocker.
249.093	Because siRNA is strongly
249.093	negatively charged,
252.706	we can protect it
254.287	with a nice, protective layer
254.287	of positively charged polymer.
259.503	The two oppositely charged
259.503	molecules stick together
262.784	through charge attraction,
264.244	and that provides us
264.244	with a protective layer
266.402	that prevents the siRNA
266.402	from degrading in the bloodstream.
270.106	We're almost done.
271.43	(Laughter)
272.914	But there is one more big obstacle
272.914	we have to think about.
277.016	In fact, it may be the biggest
277.016	obstacle of all.
279.432	How do we deploy this superweapon?
281.43	I mean, every good weapon
281.43	needs to be targeted,
284.008	we have to target this superweapon
284.008	to the supervillain cells
288.097	that reside in the tumor.
290.071	But our bodies have a natural
290.071	immune-defense system:
293.916	cells that reside in the bloodstream
295.891	and pick out things that don't belong,
298.26	so that it can destroy or eliminate them.
300.583	And guess what? Our nanoparticle
300.583	is considered a foreign object.
305.718	We have to sneak our nanoparticle
305.718	past the tumor defense system.
309.841	We have to get it past this mechanism
309.841	of getting rid of the foreign object
316.119	by disguising it.
317.563	So we add one more
317.563	negatively charged layer
321.932	around this nanoparticle,
323.28	which serves two purposes.
325.14	First, this outer layer is one
325.14	of the naturally charged,
329.132	highly hydrated polysaccharides
329.132	that resides in our body.
333.456	It creates a cloud of water molecules
333.456	around the nanoparticle
338.313	that gives us an invisibility
338.313	cloaking effect.
342.257	This invisibility cloak allows
342.257	the nanoparticle
344.998	to travel through the bloodstream
346.628	long and far enough to reach the tumor,
349.417	without getting eliminated by the body.
352.121	Second, this layer contains molecules
356.537	which bind specifically to our tumor cell.
360.19	Once bound, the cancer cell
360.19	takes up the nanoparticle,
364.734	and now we have our nanoparticle
364.734	inside the cancer cell
369.132	and ready to deploy.
371.304	Alright! I feel the same way. Let's go!
373.565	(Applause)
380.057	The siRNA is deployed first.
384.287	It acts for hours,
385.937	giving enough time to silence
385.937	and block those survival genes.
391.398	We have now disabled
391.398	those genetic superpowers.
395.725	What remains is a cancer cell
395.725	with no special defenses.
398.978	Then, the chemotherapy drug
398.978	comes out of the core
401.904	and destroys the tumor cell
401.904	cleanly and efficiently.
406.228	With sufficient gene blockers,
408.589	we can address many
408.589	different kinds of mutations,
411.823	allowing the chance to sweep out tumors,
414.208	without leaving behind any bad guys.
416.811	So, how does our strategy work?
421.543	We've tested these nanostructure
421.543	particles in animals
425.528	using a highly aggressive form
425.528	of triple-negative breast cancer.
429.135	This triple-negative breast cancer
429.135	exhibits the gene
431.714	that spits out cancer drug
431.714	as soon as it is delivered.
435.742	Usually, doxorubicin -- let's call
435.742	"it ""dox"" -- is the cancer drug"
440.937	that is the first line of treatment
440.937	for breast cancer.
444.178	So, we first treated our animals
444.178	with a dox core, dox only.
450.661	The tumor slowed their rate of growth,
452.892	but they still grew rapidly,
454.356	doubling in size
454.356	over a period of two weeks.
457.297	Then, we tried
457.297	our combination superweapon.
461.415	A nanolayer particle with siRNA
461.415	against the chemo pump,
465.851	plus, we have the dox in the core.
468.87	And look -- we found that not only
468.87	did the tumors stop growing,
473.209	they actually decreased in size
475.749	and were eliminated in some cases.
478.188	The tumors were actually regressing.
481.859	(Applause)
489.82	What's great about this approach
489.82	is that it can be personalized.
493.652	We can add many different layers of siRNA
496.512	to address different mutations
496.512	and tumor defense mechanisms.
500.094	And we can put different drugs
500.094	into the nanoparticle core.
503.946	As doctors learn how to test patients
507.177	and understand certain
507.177	tumor genetic types,
510.975	they can help us determine which patients
510.975	can benefit from this strategy
514.741	and which gene blockers we can use.
518.41	Ovarian cancer strikes
518.41	a special chord with me.
521.337	It is a very aggressive cancer,
523.334	in part because it's discovered
523.334	at very late stages,
526.243	when it's highly advanced
527.714	and there are a number
527.714	of genetic mutations.
530.566	After the first round of chemotherapy,
533.579	this cancer comes back
533.579	for 75 percent of patients.
538.333	And it usually comes back
538.333	in a drug-resistant form.
542.215	High-grade ovarian cancer
543.933	is one of the biggest
543.933	supervillains out there.
546.124	And we're now directing our superweapon
548.06	toward its defeat.
551.375	As a researcher,
552.661	I usually don't get to work with patients.
556.164	But I recently met a mother
558.605	who is an ovarian cancer survivor,
558.605	Mimi, and her daughter, Paige.
564.257	I was deeply inspired
564.257	by the optimism and strength
568.385	that both mother and daughter displayed
571.495	and by their story of courage and support.
575.119	At this event, we spoke
575.119	about the different technologies
578.546	directed at cancer.
580.355	And Mimi was in tears
581.688	as she explained how learning
581.688	about these efforts
584.539	gives her hope for future generations,
586.773	including her own daughter.
589.449	This really touched me.
591.524	It's not just about building
591.524	really elegant science.
595.14	It's about changing people's lives.
598.33	It's about understanding
598.33	the power of engineering
601.565	on the scale of molecules.
603.47	I know that as students like Paige
603.47	move forward in their careers,
607.577	they'll open new possibilities
609.041	in addressing some of the big
609.041	health problems in the world --
612.455	including ovarian cancer, neurological
612.455	disorders, infectious disease --
618.104	just as chemical engineering has
618.104	found a way to open doors for me,
622.437	and has provided a way of engineering
625.095	on the tiniest scale,
625.095	that of molecules,
628.651	to heal on the human scale.
631.797	Thank you.
632.979	(Applause)
