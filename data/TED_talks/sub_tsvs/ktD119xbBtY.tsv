18.002	Rainn Wilson: It takes
18.002	its toll, being alone.
21.937	I'm a little bit lost,
23.144	and it's finally time
23.144	to make a real connection.
26.663	Who am I?
28.171	(Drums)
30.495	I'm a single white male,
34.165	I love animals.
36.283	Gainfully employed.
38.86	I'm a people person.
41.771	I keep fit.
44.795	Who am I looking for?
46.446	I'm looking for my idea mate.
49.531	Are you that idea
49.531	that matches with who I really am?
52.409	(Video) Ron Finley: How would you feel
54.29	if you had no access to healthy food?
56.869	Gardening is the most therapeutic
56.869	and defiant act you can do.
64.994	RW: Wow, we sure are getting
64.994	our fingers dirty for a first date, huh?
68.273	RF: Gardening is the most therapeutic
68.273	and defiant act you can do.
72.075	People in these areas --
72.075	they're exposed to crappy food.
74.767	I want people to know
74.767	that growing your own food
77.059	is like printing your own money.
78.631	RW: You're like a food superhero!
80.242	RF: Food is the problem
80.242	and food is the solution.
82.589	(Music)
84.29	Erin McKean: I'm a lexicographer.
85.897	My job is to put every word
85.897	possible into the dictionary.
89.561	RW: I love words, too --
90.925	just as much as any lexi-ta-tographer.
94.517	What if you love a word
94.517	that you've just made up,
96.954	"like -- I don't know -- ""scuberfinkles""?"
98.914	Beau Lotto: Do you think you see reality?
100.921	RW: Well, I'm a little
100.921	nearsighted, but yeah.
103.252	BL: Well, you can't -- I mean,
104.776	your brain has no access to this world.
106.747	In fact, even the sensory information
106.747	that your eyes are receiving,
110.004	your ears are receiving,
111.185	is completely meaningless
111.185	because it could mean anything.
113.883	That tree could be a large object far away
116.626	or a small object up close,
117.964	and your brain has no way of knowing.
119.931	RW: Once I thought I saw Bigfoot
119.931	but it was just a German shepherd.
123.165	Isabel Behncke Izquierdo: Bonobos
123.165	are, together with chimpanzees,
126.326	your closest living relatives.
127.821	Bonobos have frequent and promiscuous sex
130.389	to manage conflict
130.389	and solve social issues.
133.465	RW: I'm just curious:
135.213	Do we have any conflict
135.213	that needs managing
137.427	or social issues to resolve?
139.467	IBI: Remember --
139.467	you're on a date with my idea,
142.733	not me.
145.228	Jane McGonigal: This is the face
145.228	of someone who, against all odds,
148.454	is on the verge of an epic win.
150.24	RW: An epic win?
151.465	JM: An epic win is an outcome
151.465	so extraordinarily positive,
155.093	you didn't even know it was possible
155.093	until you achieved it.
160.331	You're not making the face.
164.672	"You're making the ""I'm not"
164.672	"good at life"" face."
167.483	RW: Arthur, I want to be
167.483	really honest with you.
169.777	I am seeing other ideas. OK?
171.896	I'm dating around.
173.077	That's the situation.
174.779	Arthur Benjamin: I'd say this:
176.255	Mathematics is not just solving for x,
178.708	it's also figuring out why.
181.734	RW: Do you want to get some pie?
183.301	AB: Pi?
184.479	3.14159265358979 --
188.877	Reggie Watts: If we're going
188.877	to do something,
192.045	we've got to just make a decision.
193.896	Because without a decision
193.896	we're left powerless.
196.465	Without power,
198.23	we have nothing to supply
200.766	the chain of those who are truly curious
203.102	to solve all of our current conditions.
206.242	"RW: And, ""If you choose not to decide,"
208.307	"you still have made a choice"" -- Rush."
211.172	JM: Yes!
212.356	This is the face we need to see
213.891	on millions of problem solvers worldwide,
216.009	as we try to tackle the challenges
216.009	of the next century.
221.149	RW: So, are we going Dutch?
222.497	AB: 3846264338327950
232.458	RW: One night, want to go
232.458	to a movie or something?
234.835	RF: Hell, no! Let's go plant some shit!
236.737	RW: Let's plant some shit!
238.004	Good, now what is this that I'm planting?
240.005	Bonobos!
241.185	IBI: Bonobos! (Laughs)
243.347	Bonobos.
244.72	RWatts: Um, interested much?
248.904	RW: I want to have your idea baby.
251.13	RWatts: Well, you know
251.13	what they say in Russia.
254.121	RW: Hm?
255.3	"RWatts: ""scuberfinckle."""
