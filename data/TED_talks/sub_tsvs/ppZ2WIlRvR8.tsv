14.585	What do you see?
17.888	Most of you see a barbershop,
20.792	but I see an opportunity:
23.704	an opportunity for health,
26.453	an opportunity for health equity.
30.112	For black men, the barbershop
30.112	is not just a place
33.826	where you get your hair cut
33.826	or your beard trimmed.
37.328	No, it's much more than that.
40.465	Historically, the barbershop
40.465	has been a safe haven for black men.
45.364	It's a place where we go for friendship,
48.594	solidarity and solace.
52.094	It's a place where we go
52.094	to get away from the stress
55.711	of the grind of work
58.982	and sometimes home life.
62.241	It's a place where we don't have to worry
64.226	about how we're being perceived
64.226	by the outside world.
68.233	It's a place where we don't
68.233	feel threatened,
71.566	or threatening.
75.082	It's a place of loyalty and trust.
78.335	For that reason,
80.502	it's one of the few places
80.502	where we can fearlessly be ourselves
84.425	and just ... talk.
88.533	The talk, the shop talk, the conversation,
91.558	that is the essence
91.558	of the black barbershop.
95.178	I can remember going to the barbershop
95.178	with my dad as a kid.
99.134	We went to Mr. Mike's barbershop
99.134	every other Saturday.
103.53	And like clockwork,
103.53	the same group of men would be there
107.221	every time we went,
108.966	either waiting on their favorite barber
111.347	or just soaking up the atmosphere.
115.321	I can remember the jovial greeting
115.321	that warmly welcomed us
119.193	every time we went.
121.677	"""Hey Rev,"" they would say to my dad."
125.726	He's a local pastor,
125.726	and they treated him like a celebrity.
129.923	"""Hey young fella, how you doing?"""
132.266	they would say to me,
133.742	making me feel just as special.
137.118	I remember the range
137.118	of the conversations was immense.
142.173	The men would talk about politics
142.173	and sports and music
147.205	and world news, national news,
150.776	neighborhood news.
153.064	There was some talk about women
156.387	and what it was like to be
156.387	a black man in America.
160.585	But many times they also
160.585	talked about health.
165.171	The conversations about health
165.171	were lengthy and deep.
169.395	The men often recounted
169.395	their doctor's recommendations
172.608	to cut salt in their diet
174.723	or to eat less fried foods
177.468	or to stop smoking
179.713	or to reduce stress.
181.911	They talked about the different ways
181.911	you could reduce stress,
185.356	like simplifying one's love life --
188.378	(Laughter)
192.866	all ways to treat high blood pressure.
197.585	There's a lot of talk about
197.585	high blood pressure in the barbershop.
202.261	That's because almost 40 percent
202.261	of black men have it.
208.14	That means that almost
208.14	every single black man
212.157	either has high blood pressure
214.123	or knows a black man who has it.
217.94	Sometimes, those conversations
217.94	in the barbershop
221.211	would be about what happens
221.211	when high blood pressure
223.874	is not adequately addressed.
227.318	"""Say, did you hear about Jimmy?"
227.318	"He had a stroke."""
233.612	"""Did you hear about Eddie?"
233.612	He died last week.
237.891	Massive heart attack.
239.603	"He was 50."""
242.584	More black men die from high blood
242.584	pressure than from anything else,
246.527	even though decades of medical wisdom
246.527	and science have demonstrated
251.446	that death from high blood pressure
251.446	can be prevented
254.614	with timely diagnosis
254.614	and appropriate treatment.
259.132	So why is high blood pressure
259.132	so differentially deadly for black men?
264.457	Because too often, high blood pressure
264.457	is either untreated
268.391	or under-treated in black men,
271.056	in part because of our lower engagement
271.056	with the primary healthcare system.
276.558	Black men, in particular
276.558	those with high blood pressure,
280.363	are less likely to have
280.363	a primary care doctor
282.491	than other groups.
284.238	But why?
286.381	Some of our earliest research
286.381	on black men's health
289.505	revealed that for many, the doctor's
289.505	office is associated with fear,
295.09	mistrust,
297.039	disrespect,
299.084	and unnecessary unpleasantness.
303.074	The doctor's office is only a place
303.074	that you go when you don't feel well.
307.902	And when you do go,
307.902	you might wait for hours
311.216	only to get the run-around
313.589	and to be evaluated by
313.589	a stoic figure in a white coat
318.184	who only has 10 minutes to give you
320.835	and who doesn't value the talk.
325.215	So it's no wonder that some men
325.215	don't want to be bothered
328.707	and skip going to the doctor altogether,
332.027	especially if they feel fine.
335.402	But herein lies the problem.
338.328	You can feel just fine
340.473	while high blood pressure ravages
340.473	your most vital organs.
346.834	This is Denny Moe,
349.525	owner of Denny Moe's
349.525	Superstar Barbershop in Harlem.
353.738	I've been lucky enough to have Denny
353.738	as my barber for the last eight years.
358.54	He said to me once,
360.245	"""Hey Doc, you know,"
362.318	lots of black men trust their barbers
362.318	"more than they trust their doctors."""
367.879	This was stunning to me,
369.961	at first,
371.769	but not so much when you think about it.
374.871	Black men have been with their
374.871	current barbers
377.611	on average as long
377.611	as I've been with Denny,
379.636	about eight years.
381.674	And black men see their barbers
381.674	about every two weeks.
386.841	Not only do you trust your barber
386.841	with your look and with your style,
391.468	but you also trust him with your secrets
391.468	and sometimes your life.
397.191	Denny, like many barbers,
397.191	is more than just an artist,
400.843	a businessman and confidant.
403.906	He's a leader and a passionate advocate
403.906	for the well-being of his community.
410.969	The very first time I walked
410.969	into Denny Moe's shop,
413.971	he wasn't just cutting hair.
416.445	He was also orchestrating
416.445	a voter registration drive
420.222	to give a voice to his customers
420.222	and his community.
426	With this kind of activism,
429.206	and community investment
429.206	that typifies the black barbershop,
433.467	of course the barbershop
433.467	is a perfect place
437.039	to talk about high blood pressure and
437.039	other health concerns in the community.
441.944	First, the barbershop is not
441.944	a medical setting,
446.118	and so it doesn't have
446.118	all the negative psychological baggage
449.387	that comes along with that.
451.428	When you're in a barbershop,
453.507	you're in your territory,
453.507	and you're among friends
456.96	who share your history,
459.246	your struggle and your health risks.
463.308	Second, because the barbershop
463.308	is a place of connection,
467.393	loyalty and trust,
469.919	it's a place where you're more open
469.919	to have a conversation about health
473.452	and especially about high blood pressure.
476.165	After all,
477.659	conversations about high blood pressure
477.659	have all the elements of great shop talk:
483.017	stress and high blood pressure,
485.642	food and high blood pressure,
488.196	relationships and high blood pressure,
490.857	and yes, what it's like
490.857	to be a black man in America
494.816	and high blood pressure.
497.846	But you can do more than just talk
497.846	about high blood pressure
500.942	in the barbershop.
502.675	You can concretely take action.
505.915	Here we have an opportunity to partner
505.915	with the Denny Moe's of the world
510.697	and empower communities
510.697	to address the health inequities
514.999	that uniquely affect it.
517.364	When high blood pressure screening
517.364	expanded from clinics and hospitals
520.848	to communities in the 1960s and '70s,
523.999	black physicians like
523.999	Dr. Eli Saunders in Baltimore
527.38	and Dr. Keith Ferdinand in New Orleans
529.889	were at the forefront of bringing
529.889	health promotion to community hubs
533.988	in urban black neighborhoods.
536.409	These pioneers paved the way
536.409	for my professional journey
540.573	with barbershops and health,
542.58	which began in Chicago in medical school.
547.372	The very first research project
547.372	that I worked on as a medical student
550.878	was to help design
550.878	healthcare interventions
553.402	that would appeal to black men.
556.844	We conducted about a dozen focus groups
559.751	with a broad cross-section of black men,
563.05	and we learned that for them,
565.188	being healthy was as much about
565.188	being perceived as healthy
569.595	as it was about feeling healthy,
571.867	and that feeling good
571.867	went hand in hand with looking good.
578.009	This work led to the development
578.009	of Project Brotherhood,
581.882	a community clinic founded
581.882	by Dr. Eric Whitaker
584.811	that provided tailored
584.811	healthcare to black men.
588.715	Part of this tailored care
590.747	involved having a barber on the premises
593.572	to reward the men who came
593.572	for needed healthcare
597.199	with a free haircut,
599.188	to let the men know that we, too,
599.188	valued how they looked
603.158	as well as how they felt,
605.052	and that what was important to them
605.052	was also important to us.
610.32	But while there's only one
610.32	Project Brotherhood,
613.572	there are thousands of black barbershops
616.917	where the intersection of health
616.917	and haircuts can be cultivated.
622.782	The next stop on my journey
622.782	was Dallas, Texas,
626.178	where we learned that barbers
626.178	were not only willing
629.219	but fully able to roll up
629.219	their sleeves and participate
633.282	in delivering needed health services
633.282	to improve the health of their customers
638.83	and their community.
640.916	We teamed up with an amazing
640.916	cadre of black barbers
644.413	and taught them how
644.413	to measure blood pressure
646.581	and how to counsel their customers
648.386	and refer them to doctors
650.237	to help manage high blood pressure.
652.977	The barbers were not only willing to do it
655.263	but they were damn good at it.
657.794	Over a three-year period,
659.772	the barbers measured
659.772	thousands of blood pressures
662.74	resulting in hundreds of black men
662.74	being referred to doctors
667.565	for medical care
667.565	of their high blood pressure.
671.232	These barber-doctor partnerships
674.168	resulted in a 20 percent increase
674.168	in the number of men
678.676	who were able to achieve
678.676	target blood pressure levels
681.493	and a three-point drop, on average,
683.977	in the blood pressure of each participant.
686.421	If we were to extrapolate
686.421	that three point drop
689.413	to every single black man
689.413	with high blood pressure in America,
692.842	we would prevent 800 heart attacks,
699.113	from high blood pressure
700.995	in just one year.
704.802	And our experience with barbershops
704.802	has been no different in New York City,
709.048	where my journey has currently led me.
711.722	With an incredible team
711.722	of diverse research assistants,
715.69	community health workers and volunteers,
718.84	we've been able to partner
718.84	with over 200 barbershops
722.265	and other trusted community venues
724.773	to reach over 7,000 older black men.
728.564	And we've offered high blood pressure
728.564	screening and counseling
731.501	to each and every one of them.
733.81	Thanks to Denny Moe
735.519	and the myriad other barbers
735.519	and community leaders
739.146	who shared the vision of opportunity
739.146	and empowerment
744.114	to make a difference in their communities,
746.844	we've been able to not only
746.844	lower blood pressure
749.623	in our participants,
751.107	but we've also been able to impact
751.107	other health indicators.
758.3	So what do you see?
761.532	What is your barbershop?
765.694	Where is that place for you
769.574	where people who are affected
769.574	by a unique problem
773.123	can meet a unique solution?
777.567	When you find that place,
777.567	see the opportunity.
782.603	Thank you.
783.778	(Applause)
