13	Economists have been exploring
13	people's behavior for hundreds of years:
18.88	how we make decisions,
20.48	how we act individually and in groups,
23.56	how we exchange value.
26.76	They've studied the institutions
26.76	that facilitate our trade,
30.24	like legal systems,
31.68	corporations,
33.52	marketplaces.
35.6	But there is a new,
35.6	technological institution
39.08	that will fundamentally change
39.08	how we exchange value,
43.12	and it's called the blockchain.
46.04	Now, that's a pretty bold statement,
48.72	but if you take nothing else
48.72	away from this talk,
51.88	I actually want you to remember
53.64	that while blockchain technology
53.64	is relatively new,
57.6	it's also a continuation
57.6	of a very human story,
62	and the story is this.
64.08	As humans, we find ways
66.12	to lower uncertainty about one another
68.96	so that we can exchange value.
73.08	Now, one of the first people
73.08	to really explore the idea
76.599	of institutions as a tool in economics
79.8	to lower our uncertainties
79.8	about one another
82.28	and be able to do trade
84.2	was the Nobel economist Douglass North.
87.68	He passed away at the end of 2015,
89.84	but North pioneered what's called
89.84	"""new institutional economics."""
95.12	And what he meant by institutions
95.12	were really just formal rules
99.32	like a constitution,
101.32	and informal constraints, like bribery.
105.28	These institutions are really the grease
108.2	that allow our economic
108.2	wheels to function,
111.16	and we can see this play out
111.16	over the course of human history.
115.12	If we think back to when we were
115.12	hunter-gatherer economies,
118.6	we really just traded
118.6	within our village structure.
121.56	We had some informal constraints in place,
124	but we enforced
124	all of our trade with violence
127.56	or social repercussions.
129.96	As our societies grew more complex
132.32	and our trade routes grew more distant,
135.56	we built up more formal institutions,
138.6	institutions like banks for currency,
141.96	governments, corporations.
144.68	These institutions
144.68	helped us manage our trade
147.24	as the uncertainty
147.24	and the complexity grew,
150.28	and our personal control was much lower.
153.56	Eventually with the internet,
153.56	we put these same institutions online.
158.6	We built platform marketplaces
158.6	like Amazon, eBay, Alibaba,
163	just faster institutions
163	that act as middlemen
166.56	to facilitate human economic activity.
171.84	As Douglass North saw it,
174	institutions are a tool
174	to lower uncertainty
177.68	so that we can connect and exchange
177.68	all kinds of value in society.
182.84	And I believe we are now entering
185.2	a further and radical evolution
188.2	of how we interact and trade,
190.68	because for the first time,
190.68	we can lower uncertainty
194.28	not just with political
194.28	and economic institutions,
197.88	like our banks, our corporations,
197.88	our governments,
201.64	but we can do it with technology alone.
205.92	So what is the blockchain?
207.96	Blockchain technology
207.96	is a decentralized database
212.04	that stores a registry
212.04	of assets and transactions
215.6	across a peer-to-peer network.
218.16	It's basically a public registry
220.32	of who owns what and who transacts what.
223.92	The transactions are secured
223.92	through cryptography,
226.92	and over time, that transaction history
226.92	gets locked in blocks of data
232.72	that are then cryptographically
232.72	linked together and secured.
237.36	This creates an immutable,
237.36	unforgeable record
241.56	of all of the transactions
241.56	across this network.
245.4	This record is replicated
245.4	on every computer that uses the network.
251.24	It's not an app.
253.08	It's not a company.
255.12	I think it's closest in description
255.12	to something like Wikipedia.
259.8	We can see everything on Wikipedia.
261.88	It's a composite view that's constantly
261.88	changing and being updated.
267.88	We can also track those changes
267.88	over time on Wikipedia,
271.56	and we can create our own wikis,
273.88	because at their core,
273.88	they're just a data infrastructure.
278.6	On Wikipedia, it's an open platform
278.6	that stores words and images
284.12	and the changes to that data over time.
287.52	On the blockchain,
289	you can think of it
289	as an open infrastructure
291.96	that stores many kinds of assets.
295.76	It stores the history of custodianship,
298.52	ownership and location
300.76	for assets like
300.76	the digital currency Bitcoin,
304.44	other digital assets
306.04	like a title of ownership of IP.
310.48	It could be a certificate, a contract,
313.64	real world objects,
314.92	even personal identifiable information.
319.08	There are of course other
319.08	technical details to the blockchain,
322.96	but at its core, that's how it works.
325	It's this public registry
325	that stores transactions in a network
329.36	and is replicated so that it's very secure
329.36	and hard to tamper with.
335.12	Which brings me to my point
337.28	of how blockchains lower uncertainty
340.36	and how they therefore promise
340.36	to transform our economic systems
344.52	in radical ways.
347.88	So uncertainty is kind of a big term
350.24	in economics,
351.64	but I want to go through three forms of it
353.72	that we face in almost all
353.72	of our everyday transactions,
357.12	where blockchains can play a role.
359.24	We face uncertainties
359.24	like not knowing who we're dealing with,
362.64	not having visibility into a transaction
365.48	and not having recourse
365.48	if things go wrong.
369.52	So let's take the first example,
369.52	not knowing who we're dealing with.
373.72	Say I want to buy
373.72	a used smartphone on eBay.
377.76	The first thing I'm going to do
377.76	is look up who I'm buying from.
381.6	Are they a power user?
383.36	Do they have great reviews and ratings,
383.36	or do they have no profile at all?
388.96	Reviews, ratings, checkmarks:
391.76	these are the attestations
391.76	about our identities
395.4	that we cobble together today
397.04	and use to lower uncertainty
397.04	about who we're dealing with.
401.84	But the problem is
401.84	they're very fragmented.
404.88	Think about how many profiles you have.
408.52	Blockchains allow for us
408.52	to create an open, global platform
414.04	on which to store any attestation
414.04	about any individual
418.44	from any source.
420.48	This allows us to create a user-controlled
423.8	portable identity.
427.8	More than a profile,
429.72	it means you can selectively reveal
433.04	the different attributes about you
435	that help facilitate trade or interaction,
438.32	for instance that a government
438.32	issued you an ID,
441.2	or that you're over 21,
443.48	by revealing the cryptographic proof
446.12	that these details exist
446.12	and are signed off on.
450.96	Having this kind of portable identity
453.04	around the physical world
453.04	and the digital world
456.08	means we can do all kinds of human trade
459.4	in a totally new way.
462.6	So I've talked about how blockchains
462.6	could lower uncertainty
465.52	in who we're dealing with.
467.08	The second uncertainty that we often face
469.68	is just not having transparency
469.68	into our interactions.
473.6	Say you're going to send me
473.6	that smartphone by mail.
476.36	I want some degree of transparency.
478.08	I want to know that the product I bought
478.08	is the same one that arrives in the mail
482.4	and that there's some record
482.4	for how it got to me.
484.8	This is true not just
484.8	for electronics like smartphones,
487.44	but for many kinds of goods and data,
490.64	things like medicine, luxury goods,
494	any kind of data or product
494	that we don't want tampered with.
498.88	The problem in many companies,
501.12	especially those that produce
501.12	something complicated like a smartphone,
504.48	is they're managing
504.48	all of these different vendors
507	across a horizontal supply chain.
510.24	All of these people
510.24	that go into making a product,
512.84	they don't have the same database.
514.52	They don't use the same infrastructure,
516.56	and so it becomes really hard to see
516.56	transparently a product evolve over time.
523.84	Using the blockchain, we can create
525.799	a shared reality
525.799	across nontrusting entities.
530.64	By this I mean
531.88	all of these nodes in the network
531.88	do not need to know each other
535.28	or trust each other,
536.72	because they each have the ability
538.88	to monitor and validate
538.88	the chain for themselves.
543.04	Think back to Wikipedia.
544.8	It's a shared database,
547	and even though it has multiple readers
549.84	and multiple writers at the same time,
551.96	it has one single truth.
554.72	So we can create that using blockchains.
556.84	We can create a decentralized database
556.84	that has the same efficiency of a monopoly
562.84	without actually creating
562.84	that central authority.
566.2	So all of these vendors,
566.2	all sorts of companies,
568.64	can interact using the same database
568.64	without trusting one another.
574.2	It means for consumers,
574.2	we can have a lot more transparency.
577.76	As a real-world object travels along,
579.92	we can see its digital certificate
579.92	or token move on the blockchain,
585.12	adding value as it goes.
588.36	This is a whole new world
588.36	in terms of our visibility.
593.72	So I've talked about how blockchains
593.72	can lower our uncertainties about identity
599.24	and how they change
599.24	what we mean about transparency
602.48	in long distances and complex trades,
602.48	like in a supply chain.
607.52	The last uncertainty that we often face
609.64	is one of the most open-ended,
609.64	and it's reneging.
612.92	What if you don't send me the smartphone?
615.44	Can I get my money back?
617.8	Blockchains allow us to write code,
621.52	binding contracts,
623.24	between individuals
624.92	and then guarantee
624.92	that those contracts will bear out
628.6	without a third party enforcer.
631.72	So if we look at the smartphone example,
631.72	you could think about escrow.
635.64	You are financing that phone,
637.76	but you don't need to release the funds
640.32	until you can verify
640.32	that all the conditions have been met.
643.16	You got the phone.
646.24	I think this is one
646.24	of the most exciting ways
648.68	that blockchains lower our uncertainties,
651.84	because it means to some degree
653.44	we can collapse institutions
653.44	and their enforcement.
659.72	It means a lot of human economic activity
662.44	can get collateralized and automated,
667.48	and push a lot of human
667.48	intervention to the edges,
670.56	the places where information moves
670.56	from the real world to the blockchain.
676.88	I think what would probably
676.88	floor Douglass North
679.36	about this use of technology
681.76	is the fact that the very thing
681.76	that makes it work,
684.8	the very thing that keeps the blockchain
684.8	secure and verified,
689.36	is our mutual distrust.
693.6	So rather than all of our uncertainties
696.72	slowing us down
698.36	and requiring institutions
700.88	like banks, our governments,
700.88	our corporations,
705.36	we can actually harness
705.36	all of that collective uncertainty
709.76	and use it to collaborate and exchange
709.76	more and faster and more open.
716.8	Now, I don't want you
716.8	to get the impression
718.88	that the blockchain
718.88	is the solution to everything,
721.28	even though the media has said
721.28	that it's going to end world poverty,
727.84	it's also going to solve
727.84	the counterfeit drug problem
730.6	and potentially save the rainforest.
734.32	The truth is, this technology
734.32	is in its infancy,
738.32	and we're going to need to see
738.32	a lot of experiments take place
741.56	and probably fail
743	before we truly understand
743	all of the use cases
746.56	for our economy.
749.24	But there are tons of people
749.24	working on this,
751.44	from financial institutions
753.16	to technology companies,
753.16	start-ups and universities.
757.12	And one of the reasons is
757.12	that it's not just an economic evolution.
762.08	It's also an innovation
762.08	in computer science.
769.36	Blockchains give us
769.36	the technological capability
772.84	of creating a record of human exchange,
776.44	of exchange of currency,
778.72	of all kinds of digital
778.72	and physical assets,
782.44	even of our own personal attributes,
785.04	in a totally new way.
787.72	So in some ways,
789.08	they become a technological institution
792.08	that has a lot of the benefits
793.88	of the traditional institutions
793.88	we're used to using in society,
798.2	but it does this in a decentralized way.
802.36	It does this by converting
802.36	a lot of our uncertainties
805.92	into certainties.
808.36	So I think we need to start
808.36	preparing ourselves,
811.92	because we are about to face a world
814.48	where distributed, autonomous institutions
817.64	have quite a significant role.
820.6	Thank you.
821.84	(Applause)
830.4	Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Bettina.
832.88	I think I understood that it's coming,
836.6	it offers a lot of potential,
838.52	and it's complex.
840.72	What is your estimate
840.72	for the rate of adoption?
847.12	Bettina Warburg: I think
847.12	that's a really good question.
849.76	My lab is pretty much focused
851.2	on going the enterprise
851.2	and government route first,
854.68	because in reality,
854.68	blockchain is a complex technology.
858.24	How many of you actually understand
858.24	how the internet works?
861.04	But you use it every day,
862.72	so I think we're sort of facing
862.72	the same John Sculley idea
866.52	of technology should either be
866.52	invisible or beautiful,
870.2	and blockchain is kind of
870.2	neither of those things right now,
874.08	so it's better suited
874.08	for either really early adopters
878.08	who kind of get it and can tinker around
880.32	or for finding those best use cases
883.32	like identity or asset tracking
883.32	or smart contracts
886.52	that can be used at that level
886.52	of an enterprise or government.
890.56	BG: Thank you. Thanks for coming to TED.
892.489	BW: Thanks.
893.72	(Applause)
