25	Well, I thought there would be a podium, so I'm a bit scared.
28	(Laughter)
31	Chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of DNA.
34	And since, you know, I follow his orders, I'll do it.
37	But it slightly bores me.
39	(Laughter)
41	And, you know, I wrote a book. So I'll say something --
46	(Laughter)
48	-- I'll say a little about, you know, how the discovery was made,
51	and why Francis and I found it.
53	And then, I hope maybe I have at least five minutes to say
57	what makes me tick now.
61	In back of me is a picture of me when I was 17.
66	I was at the University of Chicago, in my third year,
69	and I was in my third year because the University of Chicago
75	let you in after two years of high school.
77	So you -- it was fun to get away from high school -- (Laughter) --
83	because I was very small, and I was no good in sports,
86	or anything like that.
87	But I should say that my background -- my father was, you know,
93	raised to be an Episcopalian and Republican,
95	but after one year of college, he became an atheist and a Democrat.
100	(Laughter)
103	And my mother was Irish Catholic,
105	and -- but she didn't take religion too seriously.
110	And by the age of 11, I was no longer going to Sunday Mass,
114	and going on birdwatching walks with my father.
118	So early on, I heard of Charles Darwin.
122	I guess, you know, he was the big hero.
125	And, you know, you understand life as it now exists through evolution.
131	And at the University of Chicago I was a zoology major,
135	and thought I would end up, you know, if I was bright enough,
138	maybe getting a Ph.D. from Cornell in ornithology.
143	Then, in the Chicago paper, there was a review of a book
149	"called ""What is Life?"" by the great physicist, Schrodinger."
153	And that, of course, had been a question I wanted to know.
156	You know, Darwin explained life after it got started,
159	but what was the essence of life?
161	And Schrodinger said the essence was information
165	present in our chromosomes, and it had to be present
169	on a molecule. I'd never really thought of molecules before.
175	You know chromosomes, but this was a molecule,
179	and somehow all the information was probably present
182	in some digital form. And there was the big question
186	of, how did you copy the information?
188	So that was the book. And so, from that moment on,
193	I wanted to be a geneticist --
198	understand the gene and, through that, understand life.
200	So I had, you know, a hero at a distance.
205	It wasn't a baseball player; it was Linus Pauling.
207	And so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down.
213	(Laughter)
215	So I went to Indiana,
216	which was actually as good as Caltech in genetics,
219	and besides, they had a really good basketball team. (Laughter)
223	So I had a really quite happy life at Indiana.
226	And it was at Indiana I got the impression
229	that, you know, the gene was likely to be DNA.
231	And so when I got my Ph.D., I should go and search for DNA.
235	So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought, well,
241	maybe I could become a biochemist,
242	but I discovered biochemistry was very boring.
245	It wasn't going anywhere toward, you know, saying what the gene was;
249	it was just nuclear science. And oh, that's the book, little book.
253	You can read it in about two hours.
255	And -- but then I went to a meeting in Italy.
259	And there was an unexpected speaker who wasn't on the program,
264	and he talked about DNA.
266	And this was Maurice Wilkins. He was trained as a physicist,
269	and after the war he wanted to do biophysics, and he picked DNA
273	because DNA had been determined at the Rockefeller Institute
276	to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes.
280	Most people believed it was proteins.
281	But Wilkins, you know, thought DNA was the best bet,
285	and he showed this x-ray photograph.
289	Sort of crystalline. So DNA had a structure,
293	even though it owed it to probably different molecules
296	carrying different sets of instructions.
298	So there was something universal about the DNA molecule.
300	So I wanted to work with him, but he didn't want a former birdwatcher,
305	and I ended up in Cambridge, England.
306	So I went to Cambridge,
308	because it was really the best place in the world then
311	for x-ray crystallography. And x-ray crystallography is now a subject
315	in, you know, chemistry departments.
317	I mean, in those days it was the domain of the physicists.
320	So the best place for x-ray crystallography
324	was at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge.
327	And there I met Francis Crick.
333	I went there without knowing him. He was 35. I was 23.
336	And within a day, we had decided that
341	maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA.
346	Not solve it like, you know, in rigorous fashion, but build a model,
352	an electro-model, using some coordinates of, you know,
356	length, all that sort of stuff from x-ray photographs.
359	But just ask what the molecule -- how should it fold up?
362	And the reason for doing so, at the center of this photograph,
366	is Linus Pauling. About six months before, he proposed
369	the alpha helical structure for proteins. And in doing so,
373	he banished the man out on the right,
375	Sir Lawrence Bragg, who was the Cavendish professor.
378	This is a photograph several years later,
380	when Bragg had cause to smile.
382	He certainly wasn't smiling when I got there,
384	because he was somewhat humiliated by Pauling getting the alpha helix,
388	and the Cambridge people failing because they weren't chemists.
392	And certainly, neither Crick or I were chemists,
397	so we tried to build a model. And he knew, Francis knew Wilkins.
403	So Wilkins said he thought it was the helix.
405	X-ray diagram, he thought was comparable with the helix.
408	So we built a three-stranded model.
410	The people from London came up.
412	Wilkins and this collaborator, or possible collaborator,
417	Rosalind Franklin, came up and sort of laughed at our model.
420	They said it was lousy, and it was.
422	So we were told to build no more models; we were incompetent.
427	(Laughter)
431	And so we didn't build any models,
433	and Francis sort of continued to work on proteins.
436	And basically, I did nothing. And -- except read.
442	You know, basically, reading is a good thing; you get facts.
445	And we kept telling the people in London
448	that Linus Pauling's going to move on to DNA.
450	If DNA is that important, Linus will know it.
452	He'll build a model, and then we're going to be scooped.
454	And, in fact, he'd written the people in London:
456	Could he see their x-ray photograph?
459	"And they had the wisdom to say ""no."" So he didn't have it."
462	But there was ones in the literature.
464	Actually, Linus didn't look at them that carefully.
466	But about, oh, 15 months after I got to Cambridge,
472	a rumor began to appear from Linus Pauling's son,
475	who was in Cambridge, that his father was now working on DNA.
479	And so, one day Peter came in and he said he was Peter Pauling,
483	and he gave me a copy of his father's manuscripts.
485	And boy, I was scared because I thought, you know, we may be scooped.
491	I have nothing to do, no qualifications for anything.
494	(Laughter)
496	And so there was the paper, and he proposed a three-stranded structure.
502	And I read it, and it was just -- it was crap.
504	(Laughter)
509	So this was, you know, unexpected from the world's --
512	(Laughter)
514	-- and so, it was held together by hydrogen bonds
517	between phosphate groups.
519	Well, if the peak pH that cells have is around seven,
523	those hydrogen bonds couldn't exist.
526	We rushed over to the chemistry department and said,
528	"""Could Pauling be right?"" And Alex Hust said, ""No."" So we were happy."
534	(Laughter)
536	And, you know, we were still in the game, but we were frightened
539	that somebody at Caltech would tell Linus that he was wrong.
543	"And so Bragg said, ""Build models."""
545	And a month after we got the Pauling manuscript --
549	I should say I took the manuscript to London, and showed the people.
554	Well, I said, Linus was wrong and that we're still in the game
557	and that they should immediately start building models.
559	"But Wilkins said ""no."" Rosalind Franklin was leaving in about two months,"
564	and after she left he would start building models.
567	And so I came back with that news to Cambridge,
571	"and Bragg said, ""Build models."""
572	Well, of course, I wanted to build models.
573	And there's a picture of Rosalind. She really, you know,
579	in one sense she was a chemist,
581	but really she would have been trained --
583	she didn't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry.
586	She was a crystallographer.
587	And I think part of the reason she didn't want to build models
592	was, she wasn't a chemist, whereas Pauling was a chemist.
595	And so Crick and I, you know, started building models,
600	and I'd learned a little chemistry, but not enough.
603	Well, we got the answer on the 28th February '53.
607	And it was because of a rule, which, to me, is a very good rule:
611	Never be the brightest person in a room, and we weren't.
617	We weren't the best chemists in the room.
619	I went in and showed them a pairing I'd done,
621	and Jerry Donohue -- he was a chemist -- he said, it's wrong.
625	You've got -- the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place.
628	I just put them down like they were in the books.
631	He said they were wrong.
632	"So the next day, you know, after I thought, ""Well, he might be right."""
636	So I changed the locations, and then we found the base pairing,
640	and Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions.
643	And we knew we were right.
645	So it was a pretty, you know, it all happened in about two hours.
652	From nothing to thing.
656	And we knew it was big because, you know, if you just put A next to T
661	and G next to C, you have a copying mechanism.
664	So we saw how genetic information is carried.
668	It's the order of the four bases.
669	So in a sense, it is a sort of digital-type information.
673	And you copy it by going from strand-separating.
678	So, you know, if it didn't work this way, you might as well believe it,
686	because you didn't have any other scheme.
687	(Laughter)
690	But that's not the way most scientists think.
693	Most scientists are really rather dull.
696	They said, we won't think about it until we know it's right.
698	But, you know, we thought, well, it's at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right.
704	So think about it. The next five years,
708	there were essentially something like five references
710	"to our work in ""Nature"" -- none."
713	And so we were left by ourselves,
715	and trying to do the last part of the trio: how do you --
720	what does this genetic information do?
724	It was pretty obvious that it provided the information
728	to an RNA molecule, and then how do you go from RNA to protein?
731	For about three years we just -- I tried to solve the structure of RNA.
736	It didn't yield. It didn't give good x-ray photographs.
739	I was decidedly unhappy; a girl didn't marry me.
742	It was really, you know, sort of a shitty time.
745	(Laughter)
748	So there's a picture of Francis and I before I met the girl,
752	so I'm still looking happy.
753	(Laughter)
756	But there is what we did when we didn't know
759	where to go forward: we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club.
765	George Gamow, also a great physicist, he designed the tie.
769	He was one of the members. The question was:
772	How do you go from a four-letter code
774	to the 20-letter code of proteins?
776	Feynman was a member, and Teller, and friends of Gamow.
781	But that's the only -- no, we were only photographed twice.
787	And on both occasions, you know, one of us was missing the tie.
790	There's Francis up on the upper right,
793	and Alex Rich -- the M.D.-turned-crystallographer -- is next to me.
798	This was taken in Cambridge in September of 1955.
802	And I'm smiling, sort of forced, I think,
808	because the girl I had, boy, she was gone.
811	(Laughter)
815	And so I didn't really get happy until 1960,
820	because then we found out, basically, you know,
824	that there are three forms of RNA.
826	And we knew, basically, DNA provides the information for RNA.
829	RNA provides the information for protein.
831	And that let Marshall Nirenberg, you know, take RNA -- synthetic RNA --
836	put it in a system making protein. He made polyphenylalanine,
842	polyphenylalanine. So that's the first cracking of the genetic code,
850	and it was all over by 1966.
852	So there, that's what Chris wanted me to do, it was --
855	so what happened since then?
859	Well, at that time -- I should go back.
862	When we found the structure of DNA, I gave my first talk
867	at Cold Spring Harbor. The physicist, Leo Szilard,
870	"he looked at me and said, ""Are you going to patent this?"""
873	And -- but he knew patent law, and that we couldn't patent it,
878	because you couldn't. No use for it.
880	(Laughter)
882	And so DNA didn't become a useful molecule,
886	and the lawyers didn't enter into the equation until 1973,
896	and Stanford came up with their method of recombinant DNA,
898	and Stanford patented it and made a lot of money.
901	At least they patented something
902	which, you know, could do useful things.
905	And then, they learned how to read the letters for the code.
908	And, boom, we've, you know, had a biotech industry. And,
913	but we were still a long ways from, you know,
920	answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood,
922	which is: How do you nature-nurture?
927	And so I'll go on. I'm already out of time,
931	but this is Michael Wigler, a very, very clever mathematician
934	turned physicist. And he developed a technique
937	which essentially will let us look at sample DNA
941	and, eventually, a million spots along it.
943	There's a chip there, a conventional one. Then there's one
946	made by a photolithography by a company in Madison
949	called NimbleGen, which is way ahead of Affymetrix.
954	And we use their technique.
956	And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer.
961	And you can see on the top
965	that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions.
970	So the DNA is really badly mucked up,
973	whereas if you have a chance of surviving,
975	the DNA isn't so mucked up.
977	So we think that this will eventually lead to what we call
980	"""DNA biopsies."" Before you get treated for cancer,"
984	you should really look at this technique,
986	and get a feeling of the face of the enemy.
989	It's not a -- it's only a partial look, but it's a --
992	I think it's going to be very, very useful.
995	So, we started with breast cancer
997	because there's lots of money for it, no government money.
1000	And now I have a sort of vested interest:
1004	I want to do it for prostate cancer. So, you know,
1006	you aren't treated if it's not dangerous.
1009	But Wigler, besides looking at cancer cells, looked at normal cells,
1015	and made a really sort of surprising observation.
1018	Which is, all of us have about 10 places in our genome
1022	where we've lost a gene or gained another one.
1025	So we're sort of all imperfect. And the question is well,
1031	if we're around here, you know,
1033	these little losses or gains might not be too bad.
1036	But if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene,
1041	maybe we'll feel sick.
1042	So the first disease he looked at is autism.
1046	And the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it.
1051	Looking at an individual is about 3,000 dollars. And the parent of a child
1056	with Asperger's disease, the high-intelligence autism,
1058	had sent his thing to a conventional company; they didn't do it.
1063	Couldn't do it by conventional genetics, but just scanning it
1066	we began to find genes for autism.
1069	And you can see here, there are a lot of them.
1073	So a lot of autistic kids are autistic
1077	because they just lost a big piece of DNA.
1079	I mean, big piece at the molecular level.
1081	We saw one autistic kid,
1083	about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes.
1086	We haven't yet looked at the parents, but the parents probably
1089	don't have that loss, or they wouldn't be parents.
1092	Now, so, our autism study is just beginning. We got three million dollars.
1099	I think it will cost at least 10 to 20 before you'd be in a position
1103	to help parents who've had an autistic child,
1106	or think they may have an autistic child,
1108	and can we spot the difference?
1110	So this same technique should probably look at all.
1113	It's a wonderful way to find genes.
1117	And so, I'll conclude by saying
1119	we've looked at 20 people with schizophrenia.
1121	And we thought we'd probably have to look at several hundred
1125	before we got the picture. But as you can see,
1127	there's seven out of 20 had a change which was very high.
1131	And yet, in the controls there were three.
1134	So what's the meaning of the controls?
1136	Were they crazy also, and we didn't know it?
1138	Or, you know, were they normal? I would guess they're normal.
1142	And what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure,
1149	and whether this is one that predisposes --
1155	and then there's only a sub-segment of the population
1159	that's capable of being schizophrenic.
1161	Now, we don't have really any evidence of it,
1165	but I think, to give you a hypothesis, the best guess
1170	is that if you're left-handed, you're prone to schizophrenia.
1179	and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics,
1182	which means 60 percent of the people are genetically left-handed,
1186	but only half of it showed. I don't have the time to say.
1189	Now, some people who think they're right-handed
1192	are genetically left-handed. OK. I'm just saying that, if you think,
1198	oh, I don't carry a left-handed gene so therefore my, you know,
1202	children won't be at risk of schizophrenia. You might. OK?
1205	(Laughter)
1208	So it's, to me, an extraordinarily exciting time.
1211	We ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar;
1213	there's a relationship.
1214	And if I had enough money, we'd find them all this year.
1218	I thank you.
