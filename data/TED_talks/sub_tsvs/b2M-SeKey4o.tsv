12.495	In two weeks time, that's the ninth anniversary
15.27	"of the day I first stepped out onto that hallowed ""Jeopardy"" set."
19.37	I mean, nine years is a long time.
21.22	"And given ""Jeopardy's"" average demographics,"
23.138	I think what that means
24.43	is most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead.
27.621	(Laughter)
29.804	But not all, a few are still alive.
31.243	Occasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever.
33.756	And when I do, it's as a bit of a know-it-all.
36.458	I think that ship has sailed, it's too late for me.
38.912	For better or for worse, that's what I'm going to be known as,
41.103	as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff.
44.337	And I can't complain about this.
46.625	I feel like that was always sort of my destiny,
49.038	although I had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet.
52.505	If nothing else, you realize very quickly as a teenager,
55.271	it is not a hit with girls to know Captain Kirk's middle name.
58.459	(Laughter)
59.624	And as a result, I was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know-it-all for many years.
63.855	But if you go further back, if you look at it, it's all there.
67.079	I was the kind of kid who was always bugging Mom and Dad
70.208	with whatever great fact I had just read about --
73.14	Haley's comet or giant squids
74.841	or the size of the world's biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was.
78.77	I now have a 10-year-old of my own who's exactly the same.
81.987	And I know how deeply annoying it is, so karma does work.
86.088	(Laughter)
87.588	And I loved game shows, fascinated with game shows.
90.421	I remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in 1979
93.827	because it had just hit me, as badly as I wanted to go to school,
96.352	"that I was also going to miss ""Hollywood Squares"" and ""Family Feud."""
99.685	I was going to miss my game shows.
103.912	And later, in the mid-'80s,
105.602	"when ""Jeopardy"" came back on the air,"
107.213	I remember running home from school every day to watch the show.
111.286	It was my favorite show, even before it paid for my house.
116.788	And we lived overseas, we lived in South Korea where my dad was working,
119.202	where there was only one English language TV channel.
121.619	There was Armed Forces TV,
122.869	and if you didn't speak Korean, that's what you were watching.
125.035	"So me and all my friends would run home every day and watch ""Jeopardy."""
128.351	I was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid.
131.352	I remember being able to play Trivial Pursuit against my parents back in the '80s
136.535	and holding my own, back when that was a fad.
139.369	There's a weird sense of mastery you get
141.417	when you know some bit of boomer trivia that Mom and Dad don't know.
144.662	You know some Beatles factoid that Dad didn't know.
148.218	And you think, ah hah, knowledge really is power --
151.202	the right fact deployed at exactly the right place.
158.386	I never had a guidance counselor
160.202	who thought this was a legitimate career path,
162.586	that thought you could major in trivia
165.035	or be a professional ex-game show contestant.
168.452	And so I sold out way too young.
170.852	I didn't try to figure out what one does with that.
172.286	I studied computers because I heard that was the thing,
174.751	and I became a computer programmer --
176.612	not an especially good one,
178.411	"not an especially happy one at the time when I was first on ""Jeopardy"" in 2004."
183.42	But that's what I was doing.
184.745	And it made it doubly ironic -- my computer background --
187.585	a few years later, I think 2009 or so,
191.801	"when I got another phone call from ""Jeopardy"" saying,"
194.339	"""It's early days yet, but IBM tells us"
196.662	they want to build a supercomputer to beat you at 'Jeopardy.'
201.746	"Are you up for this?"""
203.244	This was the first I'd heard of it.
204.834	And of course I said yes, for several reasons.
207.502	"One, because playing ""Jeopardy"" is a great time."
209.754	It's fun. It's the most fun you can have with your pants on.
213.426	(Laughter)
215.43	And I would do it for nothing.
216.835	I don't think they know that, luckily,
218.568	but I would go back and play for Arby's coupons.
221.786	"I just love ""Jeopardy,"" and I always have."
223.918	And second of all, because I'm a nerdy guy and this seemed like the future.
228.152	People playing computers on game shows
230.018	was the kind of thing I always imagined would happen in the future,
233.07	and now I could be on the stage with it.
234.618	I was not going to say no.
235.702	The third reason I said yes
236.835	is because I was pretty confident that I was going to win.
239.435	I had taken some artificial intelligence classes.
241.571	"I knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on ""Jeopardy."""
245.901	People don't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program
249.101	"that can read a ""Jeopardy"" clue in a natural language like English"
252.661	and understand all the double meanings, the puns, the red herrings,
256.286	unpack the meaning of the clue.
258.853	The kind of thing that a three- or four-year-old human, little kid could do,
263.494	very hard for a computer.
265.719	And I thought, well this is going to be child's play.
268.828	Yes, I will come destroy the computer and defend my species.
273.752	(Laughter)
275.603	But as the years went on,
277.203	as IBM started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this,
280.994	I started to get occasional updates from them,
283.085	and I started to get a little more worried.
284.87	I remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph.
290.953	"It was a scatter chart showing performance on ""Jeopardy,"""
294.87	"tens of thousands of dots representing ""Jeopardy"" champions up at the top"
298.521	with their performance plotted on number of --
300.803	I was going to say questions answered, but answers questioned, I guess,
304.869	clues responded to --
306.828	versus the accuracy of those answers.
309.219	So there's a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to.
312.578	And at first, it was very low.
314.369	There was no software that could compete at this kind of arena.
317.736	But then you see the line start to go up.
319.92	And it's getting very close to what they call the winner's cloud.
322.403	And I noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart
324.077	some darker dots, some black dots, that were a different color.
330.202	And thought, what are these?
331.77	"""The black dots in the upper right represent 74-time 'Jeopardy' champion Ken Jennings."""
335.662	And I saw this line coming for me.
337.854	And I realized, this is it.
338.954	This is what it looks like when the future comes for you.
340.994	(Laughter)
342.937	It's not the Terminator's gun sight;
345.119	it's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do,
349.286	the only thing that makes you special, the thing you're best at.
352.421	And when the game eventually happened about a year later,
357.173	"it was very different than the ""Jeopardy"" games I'd been used to."
360.036	"We were not playing in L.A. on the regular ""Jeopardy"" set."
362.537	Watson does not travel.
364.803	Watson's actually huge.
365.903	It's thousands of processors, a terabyte of memory,
370.436	trillions of bytes of memory.
371.854	We got to walk through his climate-controlled server room.
374.287	"The only other ""Jeopardy"" contestant to this day I've ever been inside."
377.912	And so Watson does not travel.
381.236	You must come to it; you must make the pilgrimage.
385.27	So me and the other human player
387.327	wound up at this secret IBM research lab
390.535	in the middle of these snowy woods in Westchester County
393.083	to play the computer.
394.665	And we realized right away
396.715	that the computer had a big home court advantage.
399.614	There was a big Watson logo in the middle of the stage.
401.965	Like you're going to play the Chicago Bulls,
404.632	and there's the thing in the middle of their court.
406.932	And the crowd was full of IBM V.P.s and programmers
410.168	cheering on their little darling,
412.065	having poured millions of dollars into this
414.431	hoping against hope that the humans screw up,
417.369	"and holding up ""Go Watson"" signs"
419.166	and just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right.
423.814	"I think guys had ""W-A-T-S-O-N"" written on their bellies in grease paint."
429.681	"If you can imagine computer programmers with the letters ""W-A-T-S-O-N"" written on their gut,"
435.085	it's an unpleasant sight.
436.752	But they were right. They were exactly right.
439.799	I don't want to spoil it, if you still have this sitting on your DVR,
442.215	but Watson won handily.
445.382	And I remember standing there behind the podium
448.249	as I could hear that little insectoid thumb clicking.
451.014	It had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer.
454.383	And you could hear that little tick, tick, tick, tick.
458.498	And I remember thinking, this is it.
461.251	I felt obsolete.
462.848	I felt like a Detroit factory worker of the '80s
465.899	seeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line.
468.75	I felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete
473.841	under this new regime of thinking computers.
477.62	And it hasn't been the last.
479.577	If you watch the news, you'll see occasionally --
482.219	and I see this all the time --
483.911	that pharmacists now, there's a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically
488.669	without actually needing a human pharmacist.
491.078	And a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals
493.269	because there's software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions.
497.661	You don't need human assistants for that anymore.
500.169	I read the other day about a program where you feed it a box score
503.302	from a baseball or football game
505.086	and it spits out a news article as if a human had watched the game
507.662	and was commenting on it.
509.087	And obviously these new technologies can't do as clever or creative a job
513.086	as the humans they're replacing,
514.521	but they're faster, and crucially, they're much, much cheaper.
518.338	So it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be.
523.355	I've read economists saying that, as a result of these new technologies,
526.701	we'll enter a new golden age of leisure
528.826	when we'll all have time for the things we really love
531.119	because all these onerous tasks will be taken over by Watson and his digital brethren.
538.091	I've heard other people say quite the opposite,
539.805	that this is yet another tier of the middle class
542.021	that's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology
547.055	and that this is actually something ominous,
548.619	something that we should worry about.
550.124	I'm not an economist myself.
551.973	All I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work.
555.245	And it was friggin' demoralizing. It was terrible.
558.305	Here's the one thing that I was ever good at,
560.536	and all it took was IBM pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people
564.689	and thousands of processors working in parallel
567.222	and they could do the same thing.
569.306	They could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national TV,
572.537	"and ""I'm sorry, Ken. We don't need you anymore."""
575.272	And it made me think, what does this mean,
579.005	if we're going to be able to start outsourcing,
580.744	not just lower unimportant brain functions.
584.369	I'm sure many of you remember a distant time
586.844	when we had to know phone numbers, when we knew our friends' phone numbers.
589.671	And suddenly there was a machine that did that,
591.662	and now we don't need to remember that anymore.
594.055	I have read that there's now actually evidence
595.938	that the hippocampus, the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships,
600.382	physically shrinks and atrophies
602.036	in people who use tools like GPS,
604.638	because we're not exercising our sense of direction anymore.
607.202	We're just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard.
609.536	And as a result, a part of our brain that's supposed to do that kind of stuff
612.14	gets smaller and dumber.
613.953	And it made me think, what happens when computers are now better
617.744	at knowing and remembering stuff than we are?
621.244	Is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that?
625.32	Are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less?
629.087	As somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know,
632.959	this was a terrifying idea to me.
640.183	The more I thought about it, I realized, no, it's still important.
645.16	The things we know are still important.
647.369	I came to believe there were two advantages
650.371	that those of us who have these things in our head have
654.042	"over somebody who says, ""Oh, yeah. I can Google that. Hold on a second."""
658.868	There's an advantage of volume, and there's an advantage of time.
661.536	The advantage of volume, first,
663.092	just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays.
665.724	There's so much information out there.
667.141	Being a Renaissance man or woman,
668.425	that's something that was only possible in the Renaissance.
670.591	Now it's really not possible
671.857	to be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor.
674.941	There's just too much.
676.545	They say that the scope of human information
679.042	is now doubling every 18 months or so,
681.091	the sum total of human information.
683.627	That means between now and late 2014,
687.209	we will generate as much information, in terms of gigabytes,
690.676	as all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together.
694.756	It's doubling every 18 months now.
696.827	This is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make
700.186	require the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts.
703.462	A decision like where do I go to school? What should I major in?
708.494	Who do I vote for?
709.928	Do I take this job or that one?
711.694	These are the decisions that require correct judgments
715.328	about many different kinds of facts.
717.448	If we have those facts at our mental fingertips,
719.185	we're going to be able to make informed decisions.
721.885	If, on the other hand, we need to look them all up,
724.552	we may be in trouble.
726.412	According to a National Geographic survey I just saw,
728.35	somewhere along the lines of 80 percent
730.67	of the people who vote in a U.S. presidential election about issues like foreign policy
734.685	cannot find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map.
737.652	If you can't do that first step,
740.218	are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you're going to need to know
743.253	to master your knowledge of U.S. foreign policy?
746.219	Quite probably not.
747.484	At some point you're just going to be like,
748.801	"""You know what? There's too much to know. Screw it."""
750.668	And you'll make a less informed decision.
752.468	The other issue is the advantage of time that you have
755.952	if you have all these things at your fingertips.
757.886	I always think of the story of a little girl named Tilly Smith.
761.302	She was a 10-year-old girl from Surrey, England
763.985	on vacation with her parents a few years ago in Phuket, Thailand.
767.318	She runs up to them on the beach one morning
768.968	"and says, ""Mom, Dad, we've got to get off the beach."""
771.553	"And they say, ""What do you mean? We just got here."""
774.1	"And she said, ""In Mr. Kearney's geography class last month,"
777.2	he told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to sea
780.135	and you see the waves churning way out there,
781.827	"that's the sign of a tsunami, and you need to clear the beach."""
786.025	What would you do if your 10-year-old daughter came up to you with this?
788.22	Her parents thought about it,
789.564	and they finally, to their credit, decided to believe her.
791.698	They told the lifeguard, they went back to the hotel,
793.713	and the lifeguard cleared over 100 people off the beach, luckily,
797.597	because that was the day of the Boxing Day tsunami,
800.502	the day after Christmas, 2004,
802.097	that killed thousands of people in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean.
806.063	But not on that beach, not on Mai Khao Beach,
808.537	because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before.
813.751	Now when facts come in handy like that --
815.848	I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact,
819.463	one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time --
823.735	normally something that's easier to see on game shows than in real life.
826.48	But in this case it happened in real life.
828.583	And it happens in real life all the time.
830.202	It's not always a tsunami, often it's a social situation.
832.416	It's a meeting or job interview or first date
837.129	or some relationship that gets lubricated
838.803	because two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge.
842.183	"You say where you're from, and I say, ""Oh, yeah."""
844.734	Or your alma mater or your job,
846.367	and I know just a little something about it,
848.284	enough to get the ball rolling.
849.833	People love that shared connection that gets created
851.702	when somebody knows something about you.
853.994	It's like they took the time to get to know you before you even met.
858.004	That's often the advantage of time.
859.416	"And it's not effective if you say, ""Well, hold on."
860.901	You're from Fargo, North Dakota. Let me see what comes up.
866.465	"Oh, yeah. Roger Maris was from Fargo."""
868.367	That doesn't work. That's just annoying.
871.4	(Laughter)
873.847	The great 18th-century British theologian and thinker, friend of Dr. Johnson,
879.549	"Samuel Parr once said, ""It's always better to know a thing than not to know it."""
885.917	And if I have lived my life by any kind of creed, it's probably that.
890.45	I have always believed that the things we know -- that knowledge is an absolute good,
895.983	that the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads
898.783	are what make us who we are,
900.801	as individuals and as a species.
903.318	I don't know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete.
907.415	I don't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced
910.751	by these little bubbles of specialty,
912.661	so that none of us know about the common associations
916.167	that used to bind our civilization together.
918.683	I don't want to be the last trivia know-it-all
920.617	sitting on a mountain somewhere,
922.035	"reciting to himself the state capitals and the names of ""Simpsons"" episodes"
926.4	and the lyrics of Abba songs.
930.066	I feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share
934.549	and that we know without having to outsource it to our devices,
937.735	to our search engines and our smartphones.
940.34	In the movies, when computers like Watson start to think,
944.967	things don't always end well.
947.55	Those movies are never about beautiful utopias.
951.348	"It's always a terminator or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an airlock in ""2001."""
957.083	Things always go terribly wrong.
960.318	And I feel like we're sort of at the point now
962.25	where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in.
966.333	This is a question of leadership,
967.85	because it becomes a question of who leads the future.
971.517	On the one hand, we can choose between a new golden age
977.7	where information is more universally available
981.002	than it's ever been in human history,
982.663	where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips.
985.034	And on the other hand,
986.577	we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia
989.35	where the machines have taken over
991.369	and we've all decided it's not important what we know anymore,
994.418	that knowledge isn't valuable because it's all out there in the cloud,
997.033	and why would we ever bother learning anything new.
1003.144	Those are the two choices we have. I know which future I would rather be living in.
1006.933	And we can all make that choice.
1009.166	We make that choice by being curious, inquisitive people who like to learn,
1012.501	"who don't just say, ""Well, as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over,"
1015.637	"I don't have to learn anymore,"""
1016.96	"or ""Thank goodness I have my diploma. I'm done learning for a lifetime."
1020.037	"I don't have to learn new things anymore."""
1022.396	No, every day we should be striving to learn something new.
1025.703	We should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us.
1029.895	"That's where the people you see on ""Jeopardy"" come from."
1032.62	These know-it-alls, they're not Rainman-style savants
1035.701	sitting at home memorizing the phone book.
1037.803	I've met a lot of them.
1039.119	For the most part, they are just normal folks
1040.669	who are universally interested in the world around them, curious about everything,
1044.767	thirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject.
1048.086	We can live in one of these two worlds.
1050.619	We can live in a world where our brains, the things that we know,
1053.92	continue to be the thing that makes us special,
1055.75	or a world in which we've outsourced all of that to evil supercomputers from the future like Watson.
1062.12	Ladies and gentlemen, the choice is yours.
1064.768	Thank you very much.
