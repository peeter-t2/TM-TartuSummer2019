12.599	I've learned some of
12.599	my most important life lessons
17.38	from drug dealers
19.879	and gang members
22.25	and prostitutes,
24.503	and I've had some of my most
24.503	profound theological conversations
30.13	not in the hallowed halls of a seminary
33.704	but on a street corner
36.12	on a Friday night, at 1 a.m.
39.701	That's a little unusual, since I am
39.701	a Baptist minister, seminary-trained,
45.872	and pastored a church for over 20 years,
50.226	but it's true.
52.594	It came as a part of my participation
55.264	in a public safety
55.264	crime reduction strategy
59.49	that saw a 79 percent reduction
59.49	in violent crime
63.247	over an eight-year period in a major city.
67.385	But I didn't start out wanting to be
69.242	a part of somebody's
69.242	crime reduction strategy.
73.335	I was 25, had my first church.
76.22	If you would have asked me
76.22	what my ambition was,
78.6	I would have told you
78.6	I wanted to be a megachurch pastor.
82.918	I wanted a 15-, 20,000-member church.
86.865	I wanted my own television ministry.
89.675	I wanted my own clothing line.
92.391	(Laughter)
93.747	I wanted to be your long distance carrier.
95.888	You know, the whole nine yards.
97.732	(Laughter)
100.425	After about a year of pastoring,
103.478	my membership went up about 20 members.
107.1	So megachurchdom was way down the road.
110.73	But seriously, if you'd have said,
110.73	"""What is your ambition?"""
113.554	I would have said just to be
113.554	a good pastor,
115.575	to be able to be with people
115.575	through all the passages of life,
119.94	to preach messages that would have
119.94	an everyday meaning for folks,
124.213	and in the African-American tradition,
127.115	to be able to represent
127.115	the community that I serve.
131.265	But there was something else
131.265	that was happening in my city
136.333	and in the entire metro area,
138.364	and in most metro areas
138.364	in the United States,
142.125	and that was the homicide rate
142.125	started to rise precipitously.
147.534	And there were young people
147.534	who were killing each other
150.101	for reasons that I thought
150.101	were very trivial,
152.748	like bumping into someone
152.748	in a high school hallway,
157.652	and then after school,
157.652	shooting the person.
160.921	Someone with the wrong color shirt on,
164.427	on the wrong street corner
164.427	at the wrong time.
168.63	And something needed
168.63	to be done about that.
172.548	It got to the point where it started
172.548	to change the character of the city.
176.872	You could go to any housing project,
179.1	for example, like the one that was
179.1	down the street from my church,
182.259	and you would walk in,
182.259	and it would be like a ghost town,
185.161	because the parents wouldn't allow
185.161	their kids to come out and play,
188.783	even in the summertime,
188.783	because of the violence.
191.847	You would listen in the neighborhoods
191.847	on any given night,
194.599	and to the untrained ear,
194.599	it sounded like fireworks,
197.827	but it was gunfire.
199.207	You'd hear it almost every night,
199.207	when you were cooking dinner,
203.04	telling your child a bedtime story,
203.04	or just watching TV.
208.2	And you can go to any emergency
208.2	room at any hospital,
212.994	and you would see lying on gurneys
216.123	young black and Latino men
216.123	shot and dying.
220.697	And I was doing funerals,
222.532	but not of the venerated matriarchs
222.532	and patriarchs who'd lived a long life
226.99	and there's a lot to say.
229.892	I was doing funerals of 18-year-olds,
234.71	and 16-year-olds,
236.614	and I was standing in a church
236.614	or at a funeral home
241.281	struggling to say something
243.405	that would make some meaningful impact.
247.3	And so while my colleagues were building
247.3	these cathedrals great and tall
253.29	and buying property outside of the city
256.628	and moving their congregations out
259.198	so that they could create
259.198	or recreate their cities of God,
264.337	the social structures in the inner cities
267.494	were sagging under the weight
267.494	of all of this violence.
271.411	And so I stayed, because somebody
271.411	needed to do something,
274.298	and so I had looked at what I had
274.298	and moved on that.
277.85	I started to preach decrying
277.85	the violence in the community.
282.192	And I started to look
282.192	at the programming in my church,
284.746	and I started to build programs
284.746	that would catch the at-risk youth,
288.647	those who were on the fence
288.647	to the violence.
292.106	I even tried to be innovative
292.106	in my preaching.
294.266	You all have heard of rap music, right?
296.495	Rap music?
297.725	I even tried to rap sermon one time.
300.303	It didn't work, but at least I tried it.
304.038	I'll never forget the young person
304.038	who came to me after that sermon.
308.244	He waited until everybody was gone,
310.124	"and he said, ""Rev, rap sermon, huh?"""
310.124	"And I was like, ""Yeah, what do you think?"""
313.956	"And he said, ""Don't do that again, Rev."""
316.997	(Laughter)
320.132	But I preached and I built these programs,
322.465	and I thought maybe if
322.465	my colleagues did the same
324.903	that it would make a difference.
327.109	But the violence just
327.109	careened out of control,
331.1	and people who were not involved in
331.1	the violence were getting shot and killed:
335.833	somebody going to buy a pack
335.833	of cigarettes at a convenience store,
341.662	or someone who was sitting
341.662	at a bus stop just waiting for a bus,
345.661	or kids who were playing in the park,
347.82	oblivious to the violence
347.82	on the other side of the park,
351.117	but it coming and visiting them.
353.811	Things were out of control,
356.365	and I didn't know what to do,
358.803	and then something happened
358.803	that changed everything for me.
363.795	It was a kid by the name of Jesse McKie,
366.72	walking home with his friend
366.72	Rigoberto Carrion
369.646	to the housing project
369.646	down the street from my church.
373.35	They met up with a group of youth
373.35	who were from a gang in Dorchester,
377.749	and they were killed.
380.12	But as Jesse was running
380.12	from the scene mortally wounded,
382.88	he was running in the direction
382.88	of my church,
385.249	and he died some 100, 150 yards away.
388.657	If he would have gotten to the church,
388.657	it wouldn't have made a difference,
392.196	because the lights were out;
392.196	nobody was home.
395.077	And I took that as a sign.
398.23	When they caught some of the youth
398.23	that had done this deed,
401.235	to my surprise, they were around my age,
404.903	but the gulf that was between us was vast.
408.525	It was like we were in two
408.525	completely different worlds.
412.728	And so as I contemplated all of this
415.73	and looked at what was happening,
418.138	I suddenly realized that there was
418.138	a paradox that was emerging inside of me,
424.42	and the paradox was this:
424.42	in all of those sermons
426.836	that I preached decrying the violence,
428.819	I was also talking about
428.819	building community,
433.161	but I suddenly realized
435.343	that there was a certain
435.343	segment of the population
438.432	that I was not including
438.432	in my definition of community.
442.621	And so the paradox was this:
444.02	If I really wanted the community
444.02	that I was preaching for,
447.719	I needed to reach out
449.739	and embrace this group
449.739	that I had cut out of my definition.
454.912	Which meant not about building programs
457.529	to catch those who were
457.529	on the fences of violence,
461.128	but to reach out and to embrace those
461.128	who were committing the acts of violence,
466.16	the gang bangers, the drug dealers.
468.906	As soon as I came to that realization,
468.906	a quick question came to my mind.
473.494	Why me?
475.358	I mean, isn't this a law
475.358	enforcement issue?
477.403	This is why we have the police, right?
480.233	"As soon as the question, ""Why me?"" came,"
480.233	the answer came just as quickly:
484.969	Why me? Because I'm the one who
484.969	can't sleep at night thinking about it.
490.666	Because I'm the one looking around saying
490.666	somebody needs to do something about this,
494.853	and I'm starting to realize
494.853	that that someone is me.
498.367	I mean, isn't that how
498.367	movements start anyway?
500.692	They don't start with a grand convention
500.692	and people coming together
504.926	and then walking in lockstep
504.926	with a statement.
508.749	But it starts with just a few,
508.749	or maybe just one.
513.924	It started with me that way,
516.075	and so I decided to figure out
516.075	the culture of violence
520.43	in which these young people
520.43	who were committing them existed,
523.301	and I started to volunteer
523.301	at the high school.
525.475	After about two weeks
525.475	of volunteering at the high school,
528.17	I realized that the youth
528.17	that I was trying to reach,
530.655	they weren't going to high school.
533.102	I started to walk in the community,
535.801	and it didn't take a rocket scientist
535.801	to realize that they weren't out
539.189	during the day.
541.836	So I started to walk the streets
541.836	at night, late at night,
546.471	going into the parks where they were,
549.11	building the relationship
549.11	that was necessary.
552.238	A tragedy happened in Boston
552.238	that brought a number of clergy together,
557.21	and there was a small cadre of us
557.21	who came to the realization
561.204	that we had to come out
561.204	of the four walls of our sanctuary
564.189	and meet the youth where they were,
565.868	and not try to figure out
565.868	how to bring them in.
569.735	And so we decided to walk together,
572.439	and we would get together
574.42	in one of the most dangerous
574.42	neighborhoods in the city
577.152	on a Friday night and on a Saturday night
579.567	at 10 p.m.,
581.529	and we would walk
581.529	until 2 or 3 in the morning.
584.39	I imagine we were quite the anomaly
584.39	when we first started walking.
587.612	I mean, we weren't drug dealers.
589.934	We weren't drug customers.
591.809	We weren't the police. Some of us
591.809	would have collars on.
594.566	It was probably a really odd thing.
597.143	But they started speaking
597.143	to us after a while,
600.347	and what we found out is that
602.274	while we were walking,
602.274	they were watching us,
605.963	and they wanted to make sure
605.963	of a couple of things:
608.5	that number one, we were going
608.5	to be consistent in our behavior,
613.671	that we would keep coming out there;
615.384	and then secondly,
615.384	they had wanted to make sure
617.575	that we weren't out there to exploit them.
620.13	Because there was always
620.13	somebody who would say,
622.41	"""We're going to take back the streets,"""
624.274	but they would always seem to have
624.274	a television camera with them,
627.398	or a reporter,
629.231	and they would enhance
629.231	their own reputation
631.739	to the detriment of those on the streets.
634.246	So when they saw that we had none of that,
636.801	they decided to talk to us.
639.4	And then we did
639.4	an amazing thing for preachers.
643.255	We decided to listen and not preach.
647.352	Come on, give it up for me.
649.223	(Laughter) (Applause)
652.682	All right, come on, you're cutting
652.682	into my time now, okay? (Laughter)
656.792	But it was amazing.
658.612	"We said to them, ""We don't know"
658.612	our own communities after 9 p.m. at night,
664.919	between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.,
667.759	but you do.
669.389	You are the subject matter experts,
669.389	if you will, of that period of time.
674.551	So talk to us. Teach us.
677.387	Help us to see what we're not seeing.
679.477	Help us to understand
679.477	"what we're not understanding."""
683.262	And they were all too happy to do that,
685.677	and we got an idea of what life
685.677	on the streets was all about,
690.436	very different than what you see
690.436	on the 11 o'clock news,
694.244	very different than what is portrayed
694.244	in popular media and even social media.
700.48	And as we were talking with them,
702.696	a number of myths were dispelled
702.696	about them with us.
706.899	And one of the biggest myths was
706.899	that these kids were cold and heartless
713.576	and uncharacteristically bold
713.576	in their violence.
717.44	What we found out was the exact opposite.
720.737	Most of the young people
720.737	who were out there on the streets
723.477	are just trying to make it on the streets.
726.542	And we also found out
728.492	that some of the most
728.492	intelligent and creative
732.052	and magnificent and wise
738.979	people that we've ever met
741.472	were on the street,
741.472	engaged in a struggle.
746.247	And I know some of them call it survival,
746.247	but I call them overcomers,
750.39	because when you're in
750.39	the conditions that they're in,
753.43	to be able to live every day
753.43	is an accomplishment of overcoming.
759.669	And as a result of that, we said to them,
761.823	"""How do you see this church,"
761.823	how do you see this institution
765.271	"helping this situation?"""
768.312	And we developed a plan
768.312	in conversation with these youths.
772.61	We stopped looking at them
772.61	as the problem to be solved,
776.764	and we started looking at them
776.764	as partners, as assets,
781.942	as co-laborers in the struggle
781.942	to reduce violence in the community.
787.654	Imagine developing a plan,
789.836	you have one minister at one table
789.836	and a heroin dealer at the other table,
794.945	coming up with a way in which the church
794.945	can help the entire community.
801.51	The Boston Miracle was about
801.51	bringing people together.
805.788	We had other partners.
807.645	We had law enforcement partners.
809.248	We had police officers.
812.16	It wasn't the entire force,
814.31	because there were still some who still
814.31	had that lock-'em-up mentality,
819	but there were other cops
821.136	who saw the honor in partnering
821.136	with the community,
826.221	who saw the responsibility from themselves
829.407	to be able to work as partners
829.407	with community leaders and faith leaders
835.96	in order to reduce violence
835.96	in the community.
838.49	Same with probation officers,
840.941	same with judges,
842.822	same with folks who were
842.822	up that law enforcement chain,
846.56	because they realized, like we did,
848.743	that we'll never arrest ourselves
848.743	out of this situation,
852.435	that there will not be
852.435	enough prosecutions made,
858.314	and you cannot fill these jails up enough
863.762	in order to alleviate the problem.
867.897	I helped to start an organization
	to deal with this issue.
876.443	I left it about four years ago
879.74	and started working in cities
879.74	across the United States,
884.779	and what I found out
884.779	was that in those cities,
887.599	there was always this component
887.599	of community leaders
892.429	who put their heads down
892.429	and their nose to the grindstone,
896.724	who checked their egos at the door
899.69	and saw the whole as greater
899.69	than the sum of its parts,
902.947	and came together and found ways
902.947	to work with youth out on the streets,
908.566	that the solution is not more cops,
913.349	but the solution is mining the assets
913.349	that are there in the community,
918.643	to have a strong community component
922.381	in the collaboration
922.381	around violence reduction.
927.373	Now, there is a movement
927.373	in the United States
931.705	of young people who I am very proud of
931.705	who are dealing with the structural issues
938.299	that need to change if we're going
938.299	to be a better society.
942.756	But there is this political ploy
942.756	to try to pit police brutality
947.655	and police misconduct
947.655	against black-on-black violence.
952.693	But it's a fiction.
954.597	It's all connected.
956.617	When you think about decades
956.617	of failed housing policies
961.331	and poor educational structures,
965.208	when you think about
965.208	persistent unemployment
968.482	and underemployment in a community,
971.36	when you think about poor healthcare,
974.124	and then you throw drugs into the mix
977.3	and duffel bags full of guns,
979.348	little wonder that you would see
979.348	this culture of violence emerge.
984.782	And then the response that comes
984.782	from the state is more cops
989.14	and more suppression of hot spots.
992.296	It's all connected,
994.562	and one of the wonderful things
994.562	that we've been able to do
998.34	is to be able to show the value
998.34	of partnering together --
1003.473	community, law enforcement,
1003.473	private sector, the city --
1009.039	in order to reduce violence.
1010.427	You have to value
1010.427	that community component.
1014.534	I believe that we can end
1014.534	the era of violence in our cities.
1021.154	I believe that it is possible
1021.154	and that people are doing it even now.
1027.144	But I need your help.
1029.537	It can't just come from folks
1029.537	who are burning themselves out
1034.186	in the community.
1035.744	They need support. They need help.
1038.742	Go back to your city.
1040.68	Find those people.
1042.259	"""You need some help? I'll help you out."""
1044.976	Find those people. They're there.
1048.18	Bring them together with law enforcement,
1048.18	the private sector, and the city,
1053.537	with the one aim of reducing violence,
1056.4	but make sure that
1056.4	that community component is strong.
1060.346	Because the old adage
1060.346	that comes from Burundi is right:
1063.667	that you do for me,
