16.303	Chris Anderson asked me if I could put the last 25 years
19.868	of anti-poverty campaigning into 10 minutes for TED.
24.567	That's an Englishman asking an Irishman to be succinct.
28.564	(Laughter)
30.629	"I said, ""Chris, that would take a miracle."""
35.202	"He said, ""Bono, wouldn't that be a good use of your messianic complex?"""
40.357	So, yeah.
42.378	Then I thought, let's go even further than 25 years.
46.375	Let's go back before Christ, three millennia,
50.11	to a time when, at least in my head, the journey for justice,
54.477	the march against inequality and poverty really began.
58.504	Three thousand years ago,
59.987	civilization just getting started on the banks of the Nile,
63.04	some slaves, Jewish shepherds in this instance,
66.945	smelling of sheep shit, I guess,
69.853	proclaimed to the Pharaoh, sitting high on his throne,
74.432	"""We, your majesty-ness, are equal to you."""
79.916	"And the Pharaoh replies, ""Oh, no."
83.297	"You, your miserableness, have got to be kidding."""
86.565	"And they say, ""No, no, that's what it says here"
90.377	"in our holy book."""
92.388	Cut to our century, same country, same pyramids,
95.216	another people spreading the same idea
97.454	of equality with a different book.
99.445	This time it's called the Facebook.
103.004	Crowds are gathered in Tahrir Square.
104.896	They turn a social network from virtual to actual,
107.309	and kind of rebooted the 21st century.
110.799	Not to undersell how messy and ugly
113.282	the aftermath of the Arab Spring has been,
116.03	neither to oversell the role of technology,
118.805	but these things have given a sense of what's possible
122.172	when the age-old model of power, the pyramid,
126.531	gets turned upside down, putting the people on top
129.343	and the pharaohs of today on the bottom, as it were.
133.143	It's also shown us that something as powerful
136.218	as information and the sharing of it can challenge inequality,
140.243	because facts, like people,
143.206	want to be free, and when they're free,
145.556	liberty is usually around the corner,
147.227	even for the poorest of the poor --
149.899	facts that can challenge cynicism
152.444	and the apathy that leads to inertia,
155.326	facts that tell us what's working and,
157.16	more importantly, what's not, so we can fix it,
159.893	facts that if we hear them and heed them could help us
162.443	meet the challenge that Nelson Mandela made
165.977	back in 2005,
168.502	when he asked us to be that great generation
171.19	that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity,
174.253	extreme poverty,
176.228	facts that build a powerful momentum.
180.327	So I thought, forget the rock opera,
182.915	forget the bombast, my usual tricks.
188.041	The only thing singing today would be the facts,
192.065	for I have truly embraced by inner nerd.
197.503	So exit the rock star.
203.791	Enter the evidence-based activist, the factivist.
212.951	Because what the facts are telling us
217.615	is that the long, slow journey,
220.892	humanity's long, slow journey of equality,
223.184	is actually speeding up.
224.947	Look at what's been achieved.
227.031	Look at the pictures these data sets print.
230.381	Since the year 2000, since the turn of the millennium,
233.305	there are eight million more AIDS patients
235.199	getting life-saving antiretroviral drugs.
237.93	Malaria: There are eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa
241.167	that have their death rates cut by 75 percent.
244.818	For kids under five, child mortality, kids under five,
248.498	it's down by 2.65 million a year.
251.918	That's a rate of 7,256 children's lives saved each day.
258.531	Wow. Wow. (Applause)
263.781	Let's just stop for a second, actually, and think about that.
266.069	Have you read anything anywhere in the last week
269.899	that is remotely as important as that number? Wow.
274.219	Great news. It drives me nuts
278.207	that most people don't seem to know this news.
281.095	Seven thousand kids a day. Here's two of them.
283.954	This is Michael and Benedicta,
286.632	and they're alive thanks in large part
289.283	to Dr. Patricia Asamoah -- she's amazing --
293.184	and the Global Fund, which all of you financially support,
296.154	whether you know it or not.
297.69	And the Global Fund provides antiretroviral drugs
300.608	that stop mothers from passing HIV to their kids.
304.246	This fantastic news didn't happen by itself.
307.421	It was fought for, it was campaigned for,
309.296	it was innovated for.
310.967	And this great news gives birth to even more great news,
316.196	because the historic trend is this.
319.076	The number of people living in back-breaking,
321.684	soul-crushing extreme poverty has declined
324.271	from 43 percent of the world's population in 1990
329.361	to 33 percent by 2000
332.265	and then to 21 percent by 2010.
337.036	Give it up for that. (Applause)
341.299	Halved. Halved.
344.437	Now, the rate is still too high -- still too many people
348.737	unnecessarily losing their lives.
350.715	There's still work to do.
351.836	But it's heart-stopping. It's mind-blowing stuff.
357.488	And if you live on less than $1.25 a day,
361.968	if you live in that kind of poverty,
364.116	this is not just data.
366.018	This is everything.
367.897	If you're a parent who wants the best for your kids -- and I am --
373.696	this rapid transition is a route out of despair and into hope.
379.026	And guess what? If the trajectory continues,
381.895	look where the amount of people living on $1.25 a day
386.432	gets to by 2030.
390.064	Can't be true, can it?
393.376	That's what the data is telling us. If the trajectory continues,
397.764	we get to, wow, the zero zone.
402.905	For number-crunchers like us,
404.38	that is the erogenous zone,
407.889	and it's fair to say that I am, by now,
411.08	sexually aroused by the collating of data.
416.129	So virtual elimination of extreme poverty,
421.39	as defined by people living on less than $1.25 a day,
424.99	adjusted, of course, for inflation from a 1990 baseline.
429.387	We do love a good baseline.
432.404	That's amazing.
434.125	Now I know that some of you think this progress
438.025	is all in Asia or Latin America or
440.716	model countries like Brazil --
442.048	and who doesn't love a Brazilian model? --
444.94	but look at sub-Saharan Africa.
449.05	There's a collection of 10 countries, some call them the lions,
452.725	who in the last decade have had a combination
455.453	of 100 percent debt cancellation,
456.997	a tripling of aid, a tenfold increase in FDI --
459.738	that's foreign direct investment --
461.193	which has unlocked a quadrupling of domestic resources -- that's local money --
465.115	which, when spent wisely -- that's good governance --
467.779	cut childhood mortality by a third,
470.049	doubled education completion rates,
471.756	and they, too, halved extreme poverty,
474.86	and at this rate, these 10 get to zero too.
479.289	So the pride of lions
481.542	is the proof of concept.
484.258	There are all kinds of benefits to this.
487.689	For a start, you won't have to listen
490.877	to an insufferable little jumped-up Jesus like myself.
495.229	How about that? (Applause)
500.437	And 2028, 2030? It's just around the corner.
504.475	I mean, it's about three Rolling Stones farewell concerts away.
508.756	(Laughter) I hope. I'm hoping.
514.083	Makes us look really young.
517.77	So why aren't we jumping up and down about this?
520.796	Well, the opportunity is real, but so is the jeopardy.
524.507	We can't get this done until we really accept
528.321	that we can get this done.
530.796	Look at this graph.
533.049	It's called inertia. It's how we screw it up.
537.867	And the next one is really beautiful.
539.741	It's called momentum.
543.274	And it's how we can bend the arc of history
547.83	down towards zero,
549.458	just doing the things that we know work.
551.857	So inertia versus momentum.
553.902	There is jeopardy, and of course,
556.443	the closer you get, it gets harder.
558.815	We know the obstacles that are in our way
560.759	right now, in difficult times.
562.784	In fact, today in your capital, in difficult times,
567.925	some who mind the nation's purse want to cut
570.5	life-saving programs like the Global Fund.
572.905	But you can do something about that.
574.718	You can tell politicians
576.702	that these cuts [can cost] lives.
579.608	Right now today, in Oslo as it happens,
583.185	oil companies are fighting to keep secret
585.552	their payments to governments
587.03	for extracting oil in developing countries.
590.747	You can do something about that too.
592.466	You can join the One Campaign,
594.326	and leaders like Mo Ibrahim, the telecom entrepreneur.
598.679	We're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some
602.502	of the wealth under the ground
604.974	ends up in the hands of the people living above it.
608.545	And right now, we know
612.312	that the biggest disease of all
616.024	is not a disease. It's corruption.
618.987	But there's a vaccine for that too.
620.811	It's called transparency, open data sets,
624.302	something the TED community is really on it.
629.313	Daylight, you could call it, transparency.
632.925	And technology is really turbocharging this.
635.487	It's getting harder to hide if you're doing bad stuff.
640.238	So let me tell you about the U-report,
643.22	which I'm really excited about. It's 150,000 millennials
646.827	all across Uganda, young people
649.162	armed with 2G phones, an SMS social network
653.538	exposing government corruption
656.604	and demanding to know what's in the budget
659.2	and how their money is being spent.
662.063	This is exciting stuff.
664.738	Look, once you have these tools,
668.101	you can't not use them.
669.825	Once you have this knowledge, you can't un-know it.
672.351	You can't delete this data from your brain,
675.626	but you can delete the cliched image
678.449	of supplicant, impoverished peoples
680.687	not taking control of their own lives.
682.759	You can erase that, you really can,
685.141	because it's not true anymore. (Applause)
690.618	It's transformational.
697.343	not just serving us Guinness, but drinking it.
700.137	By the time we get there,
702.271	every place with a rough semblance of governance
705.4	might actually be on their way.
709.43	So I'm here to -- I guess we're here
713.235	to try and infect you with this virtuous, data-based virus,
718.743	the one we call factivism.
720.793	It's not going to kill you.
722.437	In fact, it could save countless lives.
726.53	I guess we in the One Campaign would love you
729.209	to be contagious, spread it, share it, pass it on.
734.246	By doing so, you will join us and countless others
739.456	in what I truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken,
744.419	the ever-demanding journey of equality.
748.657	Could we really be the great generation
751.894	that Mandela asked us to be?
753.855	Might we answer that clarion call with science,
757.835	with reason, with facts,
760.494	and, dare I say it, emotions?
764.532	Because as is obvious, factivists have feelings too.
770.664	I'm thinking of Wael Ghonim, though.
773.151	Some of you know him. He set up one of the Facebook groups
775.426	behind the Tahrir Square in Cairo.
779.529	He got thrown in jail for it,
781.079	but I have his words tattooed on my brain.
785.802	"""We are going to win because we don't understand politics."
790.289	We are going to win because we don't play their dirty games.
793.414	We are going to win because we don't have a party political agenda.
796.702	We are going to win because the tears
798.673	that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts.
801.779	We are going to win because we have dreams,
804.643	"and we're willing to stand up for those dreams."""
808.153	Wael is right.
810.466	We're going to win
812.328	if we work together as one,
814.56	because the power of the people
817.004	is so much stronger than the people in power.
820.828	Thank you.
824.278	(Applause)
827.15	Thank you so much. (Applause)
