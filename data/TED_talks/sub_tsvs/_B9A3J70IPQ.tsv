12.89	A long time ago,
14.591	I was a professional animator.
18.393	(Music)
19.567	[Eric Dyer]
21.497	[Animator]
22.531	[Compositor]
28.245	And at night,
29.995	I would make my own experimental films.
32.302	(Music)
33.379	And I was spending a lot of time,
33.379	way too much time, in front of a screen
38.034	for work that would be
38.034	presented on a screen,
40.753	and I had this great need
40.753	to get my hands back on the work again.
46.64	"Now, before ""The Simpsons,"""
48.305	"before ""Gumby,"""
49.485	"before ""Betty Boop,"""
51.187	before there was such a thing
51.187	as cinema and television,
54.667	animation was hugely popular in this form.
57.615	This is a zoetrope.
59.27	And you spin this drum,
61.075	and you look through the slits
61.075	into the inside of the drum,
63.968	and you see the animation pop to life.
66.612	This is animation in physical form,
69.334	and it's animation I could
69.334	get my hands on again.
73.26	I took these ideas to Denmark.
75.134	I went there with my family
75.134	on a Fulbright Fellowship.
78.85	That's my daughter, Mia.
82.736	I rode around the city on my bicycle
85.256	and shot all the interesting
85.256	moving elements of Copenhagen:
91.012	the boaters in the canals,
93.875	the colors that explode in spring,
96.501	the free-use city bikes,
98.691	love,
100.472	textures,
102.148	the healthy cuisine --
103.519	(Laughter)
106.395	And I brought all that video
106.395	back into the physical world
109.725	by printing it out on these long
109.725	strips of ink-jet paper
112.439	and cutting out the forms.
114.154	Now, I invented my own
114.154	form of the zoetrope,
118.6	which removes the drum
121.713	and replaces the slits
121.713	with a video camera.
127.916	And this was very exciting for me,
130.611	because it meant that I could
130.611	make these physical objects,
134.819	and I could make films from those objects.
138.153	That's me riding on my bicycle.
140.191	(Laughter)
146.942	I made about 25 paper sculptures,
151.019	each the size of a bicycle wheel.
154.011	I brought them into the studio,
156.541	spun them
157.755	and shot them to make the film
157.755	"""Copenhagen Cycles."""
161.023	(Music)
169.873	This project not only allowed me
169.873	to get my hands back on the work again
173.558	but it helped me get my life back.
176.016	Instead of spending 12, 15 hours a day
176.016	with my face plastered to a screen,
181.453	I was having these little adventures
181.453	with our new family
185.036	and shooting video along the way,
187.82	and it was kind of a symbiosis
187.82	of art and life.
191.55	And I think that it's no mistake
193.572	that zoetrope translates
193.572	"into ""wheel of life."""
197.422	(Music)
203.07	But film and video does flatten sculpture,
205.518	so I tried to imagine
207.57	a way that animated sculpture
207.57	could be experienced as such,
211.522	and also a completely immersive
211.522	kind of animated sculpture.
215.593	And that's where I came up with the idea
215.593	for the zoetrope tunnel.
219.635	You walk through with a handheld strobe,
221.767	and wherever you point the flashlight,
223.883	the animation pops to life.
226.045	I plan to finish this project
226.045	in the next 30 to 40 years.
229.547	(Laughter)
232.024	But I did build a half-scale prototype.
236.441	It's covered in Velcro,
238.007	and I could lay inside on this bridge
241.547	and stick animated sequences to the walls
244.893	and test stuff out.
247.079	People would comment
247.079	that it reminded them of an MRI.
253.026	And that medical connection spoke to me,
256.202	because at the age of 14,
257.747	I was diagnosed with
257.747	a degenerative retinal condition
260.344	that's slowly taking my vision away,
262.85	and I'd never responded
262.85	to that in my work.
265.954	So I responded to it
265.954	"in this piece called, ""Implant."""
270.841	It is an imaginary,
270.841	super-magnified medical device
274.757	that fits around the optic nerve.
278.648	And the public is, in a sense,
278.648	miniaturized to experience it.
288.27	With a handheld strobe,
289.795	they can explore the sculpture,
292.877	and discover thousands
292.877	of cell-sized robots
297.867	hard at work, leaping
297.867	in and out of the optic nerve,
301.171	being deployed to the retina
302.595	to repair it.
304.081	It's my science fiction fantasy cure
304.081	of my own incurable disorder.
308.596	(Machine buzzes)
311.109	Now, in the real-world gene therapy
311.109	and gene therapy research,
315.529	healthy genes are being administered
315.529	to unhealthy cells using viruses.
321.11	There's a lot of colorful,
321.11	fluffy hope in this,
324.846	and there's also some creepy,
324.846	threatening idea
328.249	of viruses maybe becoming
328.249	an invasive species in your body.
335.881	Vision loss has helped
335.881	to take me away from the things
339.899	that disconnect me from the world.
343.052	Instead of being sealed off
343.052	in an automobile,
345.382	I ride my bike,
347.079	take buses and trains
348.741	and walk a lot.
350.579	And instead of a visually intensive
350.579	process in the studio, primarily,
355.583	I'm also getting outdoors a lot more
358.193	and using more of my senses.
360.916	This landscape is a couple hours east
360.916	of San Diego, California.
365.623	My brother lives out that way.
368.608	He and I went camping there for four days.
372.402	And I grabbed my camera,
374.509	and I walked through the canyons.
376.459	And I tried to imagine and figure out
379.529	what kind of motion would be present
382.651	in this place that was so still
382.651	and so devoid of motion.
387.229	I think it's the stillest
387.229	place I've ever been.
390.153	And I realized that it was the movement
390.153	of my own body through the landscape
395.354	that was creating the animation.
397.426	It was the motion of changing perspective.
400.129	"So I created this piece called ""Mud Caves"""
400.129	from those photographs.
404.162	It's a multilayered print piece,
406.661	and you can think of it as
406.661	a zoetrope laid flat.
410.02	It's kind of my western
410.02	landscape panorama.
413.849	And next to the print piece
413.849	there's a video monitor
417.013	that shows the animation
417.013	hidden within the artwork.
421.006	I think one of the best parts
421.006	about this project for me
423.843	was that I got to hang out
423.843	with my brother a lot,
426.526	who lives 2,500 miles away from me.
429.799	And we would just sit
429.799	in this seemingly eternal landscape
434.281	sculpted by water over millions of years
437.081	and talk.
438.747	We'd talk about our kids growing up
440.946	and the slowing pace of our parents,
443.531	and our dad who's suffering from leukemia,
443.531	memory loss and infection.
449.475	And it struck me that, as individuals,
452.317	we're finite,
453.914	but as a family,
455.39	we are an ongoing cycle --
457.532	a kind of wheel of life.
460.716	Now, I want to leave you with a tribute
460.716	to one of my mentors.
465.236	She reminds me that physical
465.236	presence is important
470.839	and that play is not a luxury,
474.217	but a necessity.
482.566	She's Pixie,
484.555	and she's our family dog.
490.796	And she loves to jump.
492.59	(Dog barking)
493.994	(Dog barking and spring boinging)
500.466	And this is a new kind of zoetrope
503.125	that I developed
503.125	at the Imaging Research Center
505.428	at UMBC in Baltimore.
508.925	"And I call it a ""real-time zoetrope."""
511.172	(Dog barking)
513.779	(Dog barking and spring boinging)
517.55	Thank you.
518.725	(Applause)
