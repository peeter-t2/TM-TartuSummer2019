16.26	I'm here to spread the word about the
18.26	magnificence of spiders
20.26	and how much we can learn from them.
23.26	Spiders are truly global citizens.
25.26	You can find spiders in nearly
27.26	every terrestrial habitat.
29.26	This red dot marks
31.26	the Great Basin of North America,
33.26	and I'm involved with an alpine biodiversity
35.26	project there with some collaborators.
37.26	Here's one of our field sites,
39.26	and just to give you a sense of perspective,
41.26	this little blue smudge here,
43.26	that's one of my collaborators.
45.26	This is a rugged and barren landscape,
48.26	yet there are quite a few spiders here.
50.26	Turning rocks over revealed this crab spider
54.26	grappling with a beetle.
56.26	Spiders are not just everywhere,
59.26	but they're extremely diverse.
61.26	There are over 40,000 described species
64.26	of spiders.
65.26	To put that number into perspective,
67.26	here's a graph comparing the 40,000
69.26	species of spiders
71.26	to the 400 species of primates.
73.26	There are two orders of magnitude more
75.26	spiders than primates.
77.26	Spiders are also extremely old.
81.26	On the bottom here,
83.26	this is the geologic timescale,
85.26	and the numbers on it indicate millions
87.26	of years from the present, so the zero here,
89.26	that would be today.
91.26	So what this figure shows is that spiders
94.26	date back to almost 380 million years.
98.26	To put that into perspective, this red
100.26	vertical bar here marks the divergence time
103.26	of humans from chimpanzees,
106.26	a mere seven million years ago.
109.26	All spiders make silk
111.26	at some point in their life.
113.26	Most spiders use copious amounts of silk,
116.26	and silk is essential to their survival
118.26	and reproduction.
120.26	Even fossil spiders can make silk,
122.26	as we can see from this impression of
124.26	a spinneret on this fossil spider.
127.26	So this means that both spiders
129.26	and spider silk have been around
131.26	for 380 million years.
136.26	It doesn't take long from working with spiders
139.26	to start noticing how essential silk is
142.26	to just about every aspect of their life.
145.26	Spiders use silk for many purposes, including
148.26	the trailing safety dragline,
150.26	wrapping eggs for reproduction,
153.26	protective retreats
155.26	and catching prey.
157.26	There are many kinds of spider silk.
159.26	For example, this garden spider can make
162.26	seven different kinds of silks.
164.26	When you look at this orb web, you're actually
166.26	seeing many types of silk fibers.
169.26	The frame and radii of this web
171.26	is made up of one type of silk,
174.26	while the capture spiral is a composite
176.26	of two different silks:
178.26	the filament and the sticky droplet.
181.26	How does an individual spider
184.26	make so many kinds of silk?
187.26	To answer that, you have to look a lot closer
189.26	at the spinneret region of a spider.
191.26	So silk comes out of the spinnerets, and for
193.26	those of us spider silk biologists, this is what
195.26	"we call the ""business end"" of the spider. (Laughter)"
197.26	We spend long days ...
199.26	Hey! Don't laugh. That's my life.
201.26	(Laughter)
203.26	We spend long days and nights
205.26	staring at this part of the spider.
208.26	And this is what we see.
210.26	You can see multiple fibers
212.26	coming out of the spinnerets, because
215.26	each spinneret has many spigots on it.
218.26	Each of these silk fibers exits from the spigot,
221.26	and if you were to trace the fiber back
223.26	into the spider, what you would find is that
226.26	each spigot connects to its own individual
228.26	silk gland. A silk gland kind of looks like a sac
231.26	with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside.
234.26	So if you ever have the opportunity to dissect
236.26	an orb-web-weaving spider,
238.26	and I hope you do,
240.26	what you would find is a bounty
243.26	of beautiful, translucent silk glands.
246.26	Inside each spider, there are hundreds
248.26	of silk glands, sometimes thousands.
251.26	These can be grouped into seven categories.
254.26	They differ by size, shape,
256.26	and sometimes even color.
258.26	In an orb-web-weaving spider,
260.26	you can find seven types of silk glands,
262.26	and what I have depicted here in this picture,
264.26	let's start at the one o'clock position,
267.26	there's tubuliform silk glands, which are used
269.26	to make the outer silk of an egg sac.
271.26	There's the aggregate and flagelliform silk
273.26	glands which combine to make the sticky
275.26	capture spiral of an orb web.
278.26	Pyriform silk glands make the attachment
280.26	cement -- that's the silk that's used to adhere
283.26	silk lines to a substrate.
286.26	There's also aciniform silk,
288.26	which is used to wrap prey.
290.26	Minor ampullate silk is used in web construction.
292.26	And the most studied silk line
294.26	of them all: major ampullate silk.
296.26	This is the silk that's used to make the frame
298.26	and radii of an orb web, and also
301.26	the safety trailing dragline.
304.26	But what, exactly, is spider silk?
308.26	Spider silk is almost entirely protein.
311.26	Nearly all of these proteins can be explained
313.26	by a single gene family,
316.26	so this means that the diversity of silk types
318.26	we see today is encoded by one gene family,
323.26	so presumably the original spider ancestor
326.26	made one kind of silk,
328.26	and over the last 380 million years,
331.26	that one silk gene has duplicated
334.26	and then diverged, specialized,
337.26	over and over and over again, to get
340.26	the large variety of flavors of spider silks
342.26	that we have today.
345.26	There are several features that all these silks
347.26	have in common. They all have a common
349.26	design, such as they're all very long --
351.26	they're sort of outlandishly long
354.26	compared to other proteins.
356.26	They're very repetitive, and they're very rich
359.26	in the amino acids glycine and alanine.
362.26	To give you an idea of what
364.26	a spider silk protein looks like,
366.26	this is a dragline silk protein,
368.26	it's just a portion of it,
370.26	from the black widow spider.
372.26	This is the kind of sequence that I love
374.26	looking at day and night. (Laughter)
377.26	So what you're seeing here is the one letter
379.26	abbreviation for amino acids, and I've colored
381.26	in the glycines with green,
383.26	and the alanines in red, and so
385.26	you can see it's just a lot of G's and A's.
388.26	You can also see that there's a lot of short
391.26	sequence motifs that repeat over and over
394.26	and over again, so for example there's a lot of
396.26	what we call polyalanines, or iterated A's,
399.26	AAAAA. There's GGQ. There's GGY.
403.26	You can think of these short motifs
405.26	that repeat over and over again as words,
408.26	and these words occur in sentences.
411.26	So for example this would be one sentence,
414.26	and you would get this sort of green region
416.26	and the red polyalanine, that repeats
418.26	over and over and over again,
420.26	and you can have that hundreds and
422.26	hundreds and hundreds of times within
424.26	an individual silk molecule.
426.26	Silks made by the same spider can have
428.26	dramatically different repeat sequences.
431.26	At the top of the screen, you're seeing
434.26	the repeat unit from the dragline silk
437.26	of a garden argiope spider.
440.26	It's short. And on the bottom,
442.26	this is the repeat sequence for the
444.26	egg case, or tubuliform silk protein,
446.26	for the exact same spider. And you can see
449.26	how dramatically different
451.26	these silk proteins are -- so this is
454.26	sort of the beauty of the diversification
456.26	of the spider silk gene family.
458.26	You can see that the repeat units differ
460.26	in length. They also differ in sequence.
462.26	So I've colored in the glycines again
464.26	in green, alanine in red, and the serines,
467.26	the letter S, in purple. And you can see
470.26	that the top repeat unit can be explained
472.26	almost entirely by green and red,
475.26	and the bottom repeat unit has
477.26	a substantial amount of purple.
479.26	What silk biologists do is we try to relate
482.26	these sequences, these amino acid
484.26	sequences, to the mechanical properties
486.26	of the silk fibers.
488.26	Now, it's really convenient that spiders use their silk
491.26	completely outside their body.
493.26	This makes testing spider silk really, really
495.26	easy to do in the laboratory, because
497.26	we're actually, you know, testing it in air
500.26	that's exactly the environment that
502.26	spiders are using their silk proteins.
504.26	So this makes quantifying silk properties by
506.26	methods such as tensile testing, which is
508.26	basically, you know, tugging on one end
510.26	of the fiber, very amenable.
513.26	Here are stress-strain curves
516.26	generated by tensile testing
518.26	five fibers made by the same spider.
521.26	So what you can see here is that
524.26	the five fibers have different behaviors.
527.26	Specifically, if you look on the vertical axis,
529.26	that's stress. If you look at the maximum
532.26	stress value for each of these fibers,
534.26	you can see that there's a lot of variation,
537.26	and in fact dragline, or major ampullate silk,
540.26	is the strongest of these fibers.
542.26	We think that's because the dragline silk,
545.26	which is used to make the frame and radii
548.26	for a web, needs to be very strong.
550.26	On the other hand, if you were to look at
552.26	strain -- this is how much a fiber can be
554.26	extended -- if you look at the maximum value
556.26	here, again, there's a lot of variation
559.26	and the clear winner is flagelliform,
561.26	or the capture spiral filament.
563.26	In fact, this flagelliform fiber can
565.26	actually stretch over twice its original length.
569.26	So silk fibers vary in their strength
572.26	and also their extensibility.
574.26	In the case of the capture spiral,
576.26	it needs to be so stretchy to absorb
578.26	the impact of flying prey.
580.26	If it wasn't able to stretch so much, then
582.26	basically when an insect hit the web,
584.26	it would just trampoline right off of it.
586.26	So if the web was made entirely out of
588.26	dragline silk, an insect is very likely to just
591.26	bounce right off. But by having really, really
593.26	stretchy capture spiral silk, the web is actually
595.26	able to absorb the impact
597.26	of that intercepted prey.
600.26	There's quite a bit of variation within
602.26	the fibers that an individual spider can make.
605.26	We call that the tool kit of a spider.
608.26	That's what the spider has
610.26	to interact with their environment.
612.26	But how about variation among spider
614.26	species, so looking at one type of silk
616.26	and looking at different species of spiders?
619.26	This is an area that's largely unexplored
621.26	but here's a little bit of data I can show you.
625.26	This is the comparison of the toughness
627.26	of the dragline spilk spun
629.26	by 21 species of spiders.
631.26	Some of them are orb-weaving spiders and
633.26	some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders.
636.26	It's been hypothesized that
638.26	orb-weaving spiders, like this argiope here,
641.26	should have the toughest dragline silks
643.26	because they must intercept flying prey.
646.26	What you see here on this toughness graph
649.26	is the higher the black dot is on the graph,
651.26	the higher the toughness.
653.26	The 21 species are indicated here by this
656.26	phylogeny, this evolutionary tree, that shows
659.26	their genetic relationships, and I've colored
661.26	in yellow the orb-web-weaving spiders.
664.26	If you look right here at the two red arrows,
667.26	they point to the toughness values
670.26	for the draglines of nephila clavipes and
672.26	araneus diadematus.
674.26	These are the two species of spiders
676.26	for which the vast majority of time and money
679.26	on synthetic spider silk research has been
682.26	to replicate their dragline silk proteins.
685.26	Yet, their draglines are not the toughest.
689.26	In fact, the toughest dragline in this survey
692.26	is this one right here in this white region,
695.26	a non orb-web-weaving spider.
697.26	This is the dragline spun by scytodes,
699.26	the spitting spider.
701.26	Scytodes doesn't use a web at all
704.26	to catch prey. Instead, scytodes
706.26	sort of lurks around and waits for prey
709.26	to get close to it, and then immobilizes prey
712.26	by spraying a silk-like venom onto that insect.
716.26	Think of hunting with silly string.
719.26	That's how scytodes forages.
722.26	We don't really know why scytodes
724.26	needs such a tough dragline,
727.26	but it's unexpected results like this that make
730.26	bio-prospecting so exciting and worthwhile.
734.26	It frees us from the constraints
736.26	of our imagination.
738.26	Now I'm going to mark on
740.26	the toughness values for nylon fiber,
743.26	bombyx -- or domesticated silkworm silk --
746.26	wool, Kevlar, and carbon fibers.
749.26	And what you can see is that nearly
751.26	all the spider draglines surpass them.
753.26	It's the combination of strength, extensibility
757.26	and toughness that makes spider silk so
760.26	special, and that has attracted the attention
763.26	of biomimeticists, so people that turn
766.26	to nature to try to find new solutions.
769.26	And the strength, extensibility and toughness
772.26	of spider silks combined with the fact that
775.26	silks do not elicit an immune response,
778.26	have attracted a lot of interest in the use
781.26	of spider silks in biomedical applications,
783.26	for example, as a component of
785.26	artificial tendons, for serving as
788.26	guides to regrow nerves, and for
792.26	scaffolds for tissue growth.
795.26	Spider silks also have a lot of potential
798.26	for their anti-ballistic capabilities.
800.26	Silks could be incorporated into body
802.26	and equipment armor that would be more
805.26	lightweight and flexible
807.26	than any armor available today.
810.26	In addition to these biomimetic
813.26	applications of spider silks,
815.26	personally, I find studying spider silks
819.26	just fascinating in and of itself.
822.26	I love when I'm in the laboratory,
826.26	a new spider silk sequence comes in.
829.26	That's just the best. (Laughter)
832.26	It's like the spiders are sharing
835.26	an ancient secret with me, and that's why
837.26	I'm going to spend the rest of my life
839.26	studying spider silk.
841.26	The next time you see a spider web,
844.26	please, pause and look a little closer.
847.26	You'll be seeing one of the most
849.26	high-performance materials known to man.
852.26	To borrow from the writings
854.26	of a spider named Charlotte,
857.26	silk is terrific.
859.26	Thank you. (Applause)
862.26	(Applause)
