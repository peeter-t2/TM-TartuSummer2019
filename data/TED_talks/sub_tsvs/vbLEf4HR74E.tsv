12.531	So, I guess it is a result
12.531	of globalization
16.57	that you can find Coca-Cola tins
16.57	on top of Everest
20.198	and a Buddhist monk in Monterey.
22.16	(Laughter)
25.04	And so I just came,
25.04	two days ago, from the Himalayas
30.159	to your kind invitation.
31.603	So I would like to invite you, also,
31.603	for a while, to the Himalayas themselves.
37.257	And to show the place
37.257	where meditators, like me,
43.374	who began with being a molecular biologist
43.374	in Pasteur Institute,
47.37	and found their way to the mountains.
51.811	So these are a few images
51.811	I was lucky to take and be there.
58.871	There's Mount Kailash
58.871	in Eastern Tibet -- wonderful setting.
64.16	This is from Marlboro country.
66.16	(Laughter)
71.553	This is a turquoise lake.
73.925	A meditator.
76.033	This is the hottest day of the year
76.033	somewhere in Eastern Tibet, on August 1.
81.16	And the night before, we camped,
81.16	and my Tibetan friends said,
86.16	"""We are going to sleep outside."""
88.421	"And I said, ""Why? We have"
88.421	"enough space in the tent."""
91.032	"They said, ""Yes, but it's summertime."""
92.88	(Laughter)
97.455	So now, we are going
97.455	to speak of happiness.
100.16	As a Frenchman, I must say
102.979	that there are
102.979	a lot of French intellectuals
105.051	that think happiness
105.051	is not at all interesting.
108.136	(Laughter)
109.16	I just wrote an essay on happiness,
109.16	and there was a controversy.
112.709	And someone wrote an article saying,
114.984	"""Don't impose on us"
114.984	"the dirty work of happiness."""
118.034	(Laughter)
119.16	"""We don't care about being happy."
119.16	We need to live with passion.
123.39	We like the ups and downs of life.
125.765	We like our suffering because it's so good
125.765	"when it ceases for a while."""
129.231	(Laughter)
133.16	This is what I see from the balcony
133.16	of my hermitage in the Himalayas.
138.16	It's about two meters by three,
138.16	and you are all welcome any time.
141.563	(Laughter)
143.795	Now, let's come
143.795	to happiness or well-being.
148.781	And first of all, you know,
148.781	despite what the French intellectuals say,
153.16	it seems that no one wakes up
153.16	in the morning thinking,
156.614	"""May I suffer the whole day?"""
158.16	(Laughter)
159.519	Which means that somehow,
159.519	consciously or not,
164.16	directly or indirectly,
164.16	in the short or the long term,
168.533	whatever we do, whatever we hope,
168.533	whatever we dream --
173.059	somehow, is related to a deep, profound
173.059	desire for well-being or happiness.
180.088	As Pascal said,
180.088	even the one who hangs himself,
183.529	somehow, is looking
183.529	for cessation of suffering.
188.593	He finds no other way.
191.358	But then, if you look
191.358	in the literature, East and West,
194.669	you can find incredible diversity
194.669	of definition of happiness.
199.615	Some people say, I only believed
199.615	in remembering the past,
204.16	imagining the future, never the present.
206.617	Some people say happiness is right now;
209.554	it's the quality of the freshness
209.554	of the present moment.
213.842	And that led Henri Bergson,
213.842	the French philosopher, to say,
217.703	"""All the great thinkers of humanity"
217.703	have left happiness in the vague
221.582	so that each of them
221.582	"could define their own terms."""
226.16	Well, that would be fine if it was just
226.16	a secondary preoccupation in life.
231.953	But now, if it is something
231.953	that is going to determine
234.954	the quality of every instant of our life,
237.755	then we better know what it is,
237.755	have some clearer idea.
242.834	And probably, the fact
242.834	that we don't know that is why, so often,
248.16	although we seek happiness,
248.16	it seems we turn our back to it.
251.449	Although we want to avoid suffering,
253.268	it seems we are running
253.268	somewhat towards it.
256.349	And that can also come
256.349	from some kind of confusions.
260.16	One of the most common ones
260.16	is happiness and pleasure.
263.754	But if you look at
263.754	the characteristics of those two,
267.76	pleasure is contingent upon time,
267.76	upon its object,
273.022	upon the place.
275.16	It is something that -- changes of nature.
280.16	Beautiful chocolate cake:
280.16	first serving is delicious,
283.741	second one not so much,
283.741	then we feel disgust.
286.742	(Laughter)
289.541	That's the nature of things.
291.088	We get tired.
293.16	I used to be a fan of Bach.
295.464	I used to play it on the guitar, you know.
297.489	I can hear it two, three, five times.
299.322	If I had to hear it 24 hours,
299.322	non-stop, it might be very tiring.
304.422	If you are feeling very cold,
304.422	you come near a fire, it's so wonderful.
308.603	After some moments,
308.603	you just go a little back,
310.776	and then it starts burning.
312.803	It sort of uses itself
312.803	as you experience it.
319.16	And also, again, it can --
319.16	also, it's something that you --
323.16	it is not something
323.16	that is radiating outside.
325.375	Like, you can feel intense pleasure
327.665	and some others around you
327.665	can be suffering a lot.
332.314	Now, what, then, will be happiness?
335.16	And happiness, of course, is such
335.16	a vague word, so let's say well-being.
341.572	And so, I think the best definition,
341.572	according to the Buddhist view,
345.924	is that well-being is not just
345.924	a mere pleasurable sensation.
353.31	It is a deep sense
353.31	of serenity and fulfillment.
359.201	A state that actually pervades
365.581	and underlies all emotional states,
369.326	and all the joys and sorrows
369.326	that can come one's way.
373.648	For you, that might be surprising.
375.795	Can we have this kind of well-being
375.795	while being sad?
379.367	In a way, why not?
381.403	Because we are speaking
381.403	of a different level.
387.16	Look at the waves coming near the shore.
391.08	When you are at the bottom
391.08	of the wave, you hit the bottom.
395.04	You hit the solid rock.
396.785	When you are surfing on the top,
396.785	you are all elated.
399.454	So you go from elation
399.454	to depression -- there's no depth.
403.779	Now, if you look at the high sea,
406.945	there might be beautiful,
406.945	calm ocean, like a mirror.
410.693	There might be storms,
412.839	but the depth of the ocean
412.839	is still there, unchanged.
418.669	So now, how is that?
420.16	It can only be a state of being,
420.16	not just a fleeting emotion, sensation.
424.925	Even joy -- that can be
424.925	the spring of happiness.
428.695	But there's also wicked joy,
428.695	you can rejoice in someone's suffering.
433.597	So how do we proceed
433.597	in our quest for happiness?
438.125	Very often, we look outside.
441.77	We think that if we could gather
441.77	this and that, all the conditions,
446.098	something that we say,
446.098	"""Everything to be happy --"
449.16	"to have everything to be happy."""
451.44	That very sentence already reveals
451.44	the doom, destruction of happiness.
455.88	To have everything.
457.159	If we miss something, it collapses.
460.985	And also, when things go wrong,
460.985	we try to fix the outside so much,
464.808	but our control
464.808	of the outer world is limited,
470.344	temporary, and often, illusory.
474.263	So now, look at inner conditions.
477.248	Aren't they stronger?
478.673	Isn't it the mind that translates
481.462	the outer condition
481.462	into happiness and suffering?
484.308	And isn't that stronger?
486.16	We know, by experience,
487.933	that we can be
487.933	"what we call ""a little paradise,"""
491.291	and yet, be completely unhappy within.
496.16	The Dalai Lama was once in Portugal,
498.372	and there was a lot of construction
498.372	going on everywhere.
501.16	So one evening, he said,
501.16	"""Look, you are doing all these things,"
504.184	but isn't it nice, also,
504.184	"to build something within?"""
507.16	"And he said, ""[Without] that --"
507.16	even if you get a high-tech flat
512.16	on the 100th floor of a super-modern
512.16	and comfortable building,
517.434	if you are deeply unhappy within,
519.16	all you are going to look for
519.16	"is a window from which to jump."""
524.61	So now, at the opposite,
526.16	we know a lot of people who,
526.16	in very difficult circumstances,
530.62	manage to keep serenity, inner strength,
530.62	inner freedom, confidence.
537.16	So now, if the inner conditions
537.16	are stronger --
539.423	of course, the outer
539.423	conditions do influence,
542.07	and it's wonderful to live
542.07	longer, healthier,
545.678	to have access to information, education,
548.495	to be able to travel, to have freedom.
551.169	It's highly desirable.
553.689	However, this is not enough.
555.272	Those are just auxiliary, help conditions.
560.463	The experience that translates
560.463	everything is within the mind.
564.643	So then, when we ask oneself
566.352	how to nurture
566.352	the condition for happiness,
570.756	the inner conditions, and which are those
570.756	which will undermine happiness.
576.968	So then, this just needs
576.968	to have some experience.
580.349	We have to know from ourselves,
580.349	there are certain states of mind
583.428	that are conducive to this flourishing,
583.428	to this well-being,
586.761	what the Greeks called
586.761	eudaimonia, flourishing.
591.048	There are some which are adverse
591.048	to this well-being.
595.905	And so, if we look
595.905	from our own experience,
599.488	anger, hatred, jealousy, arrogance,
603.721	obsessive desire, strong grasping,
608.51	they don't leave us in such a good state
608.51	after we have experienced it.
612.857	And also, they are detrimental
612.857	to others' happiness.
617.16	So we may consider that the more
617.16	those are invading our mind,
621.87	and, like a chain reaction,
623.545	the more we feel miserable,
623.545	we feel tormented.
627.699	At the opposite,
627.699	everyone knows deep within
631.273	that an act of selfless generosity,
633.496	if from the distance, without anyone
633.496	knowing anything about it,
637.805	we could save a child's life,
637.805	make someone happy.
642.031	We don't need the recognition.
642.031	We don't need any gratitude.
645.605	Just the mere fact of doing that
648.35	fills such a sense of adequation
648.35	with our deep nature.
652.77	And we would like to be
652.77	like that all the time.
656.16	So is that possible,
657.765	to change our way of being,
657.765	to transform one's mind?
662.67	Aren't those negative emotions,
662.67	or destructive emotions,
666.16	inherent to the nature of mind?
669.16	Is change possible in our emotions,
669.16	in our traits, in our moods?
675.024	For that we have to ask,
675.024	what is the nature of mind?
678.072	And if we look from
678.072	the experiential point of view,
682.658	there is a primary
682.658	quality of consciousness
685.16	that's just the mere fact
685.16	to be cognitive, to be aware.
690.31	Consciousness is like a mirror
690.31	that allows all images to rise on it.
695.16	You can have ugly faces,
695.16	beautiful faces in the mirror.
698.318	The mirror allows that,
698.318	but the mirror is not tainted,
701.814	is not modified,
701.814	is not altered by those images.
706.16	Likewise, behind every single thought
709.117	there is the bare consciousness,
709.117	pure awareness.
713.967	This is the nature.
715.306	It cannot be tainted intrinsically
715.306	with hatred or jealousy because then,
719.931	if it was always there --
721.562	like a dye that would permeate
721.562	the whole cloth --
725.49	then it would be found
725.49	all the time, somewhere.
728.382	We know we're not always angry,
728.382	always jealous, always generous.
733.16	So, because the basic
733.16	fabric of consciousness
736.16	is this pure cognitive quality
736.16	that differentiates it from a stone,
740.476	there is a possibility for change
740.476	because all emotions are fleeting.
744.302	That is the ground for mind training.
747.16	Mind training is based on the idea
747.16	that two opposite mental factors
751.998	cannot happen at the same time.
754.263	You could go from love to hate.
756.236	But you cannot, at the same time,
756.236	toward the same object,
759.477	the same person, want to harm
759.477	and want to do good.
762.88	You cannot, in the same gesture,
762.88	shake hand and give a blow.
767.587	So, there are natural
767.587	antidotes to emotions
770.871	that are destructive
770.871	to our inner well-being.
774.603	So that's the way to proceed.
777.106	Rejoicing compared to jealousy.
780.61	A kind of sense of inner freedom
782.994	as opposite to intense
782.994	grasping and obsession.
787.904	Benevolence, loving kindness
787.904	against hatred.
793.16	But, of course, each emotion then
793.16	would need a particular antidote.
798.16	Another way is to try to find
798.16	a general antidote to all emotions,
803.16	and that's by looking at the very nature.
806.04	Usually, when we feel annoyed,
806.04	hatred or upset with someone,
811.523	or obsessed with something,
813.84	the mind goes again
813.84	and again to that object.
816.398	Each time it goes to the object,
818.248	it reinforces that obsession
818.248	or that annoyance.
821.906	So then, it's a self-perpetuating process.
825.874	So what we need to look for now is,
827.658	instead of looking outward,
827.658	we look inward.
831	Look at anger itself.
832.368	It looks very menacing,
833.93	like a billowing monsoon cloud
833.93	or thunderstorm.
838.817	We think we could sit on the cloud,
841.104	but if you go there, it's just mist.
843.485	Likewise, if you look
843.485	at the thought of anger,
846.651	it will vanish like frost
846.651	under the morning sun.
850.538	If you do this again
850.538	and again, the propensity,
853.421	the tendencies for anger to arise again
856.16	will be less and less
856.16	each time you dissolve it.
859.509	And, at the end, although it may rise,
861.546	it will just cross the mind,
863.16	like a bird crossing the sky
863.16	without leaving any track.
866.53	So this is the principal of mind training.
870.358	Now, it takes time,
873.887	because it took time for all those faults
873.887	in our mind, the tendencies, to build up,
880.882	so it will take time
880.882	to unfold them as well.
883.647	But that's the only way to go.
885.607	Mind transformation --
885.607	that is the very meaning of meditation.
890.16	It means familiarization
890.16	with a new way of being,
893.16	new way of perceiving things,
894.838	which is more in adequation with reality,
897.16	with interdependence, with the stream
897.16	and continuous transformation,
901.16	which our being and our consciousness is.
904.119	So, the interface with cognitive science,
906.12	since we need to come to that,
906.12	it was, I suppose, the subject of --
909.304	we have to deal in such a short time --
909.304	with brain plasticity.
912.852	The brain was thought
912.852	to be more or less fixed.
915.849	All the nominal connections,
915.849	in numbers and quantities,
918.515	were thought, until the last 20 years,
921.48	to be more or less fixed
921.48	when we reached adult age.
925.384	Now, recently, it has been found
925.384	that it can change a lot.
928.655	A violinist, as we heard, who has done
932.581	some area that controls the movements
932.581	of fingers in the brain changes a lot,
937.426	increasing reinforcement
937.426	of the synaptic connections.
941.44	So can we do that with human qualities?
944.758	With loving kindness,
944.758	with patience, with openness?
949.16	So that's what those great
949.16	meditators have been doing.
953.378	Some of them who came to the labs,
956.912	like in Madison, Wisconsin,
956.912	or in Berkeley,
960.836	did 20 to 40,000 hours of meditation.
964.936	They do, like, three years' retreat,
964.936	where they do meditate 12 hours a day.
968.488	And then, the rest of their life,
968.488	they will do three or four hours a day.
971.972	They are real Olympic
971.972	champions of mind training.
974.973	(Laughter)
977.974	This is the place where the meditators --
977.974	you can see it's kind of inspiring.
981.842	Now, here with 256 electrodes.
987.977	(Laughter)
991.056	So what did they find?
992.261	Of course, same thing.
995.16	The scientific embargo --
996.881	"if it's ever submitted to ""Nature,"""
996.881	hopefully, it will be accepted.
1001.406	It deals with the state of compassion,
1001.406	unconditional compassion.
1005.421	We asked meditators, who have
1005.421	been doing that for years and years,
1009.16	to put their mind in a state
1009.16	where there's nothing but loving kindness,
1013.877	total availability to sentient being.
1016.311	Of course, during the training,
1016.311	we do that with objects.
1018.961	We think of people suffering,
1018.961	of people we love,
1021.271	but at some point, it can be
1021.271	a state which is all pervading.
1025.324	Here is the preliminary result,
1027.867	which I can show
1027.867	because it's already been shown.
1030.221	The bell curve shows 150 controls,
1035.145	and what is being looked at
1037.358	is the difference between the right
1037.358	and the left frontal lobe.
1040.75	In very short, people
1040.75	who have more activity
1043.609	in the right side of the prefrontal cortex
1046.296	are more depressed, withdrawn.
1049.772	They don't describe
1049.772	a lot of positive affect.
1053.16	It's the opposite on the left side:
1056.124	more tendency to altruism,
1058.16	to happiness, to express,
1058.16	and curiosity and so forth.
1062.897	So there's a basic line for people.
1062.897	And also, it can be changed.
1067.014	If you see a comic movie,
1067.014	you go off to the left side.
1069.562	If you are happy about something,
1069.562	you'll go more to the left side.
1073.002	If you have a bout of depression,
1073.002	you'll go to the right side.
1076.71	Here, the -0.5 is the full
1076.71	standard deviation
1082.44	of a meditator
1082.44	who meditated on compassion.
1085.16	It's something that is totally out
1085.16	of the bell curve.
1089.292	So, I've no time to go
1089.292	into all the different scientific results.
1093.16	Hopefully, they will come.
1094.722	But they found that --
1094.722	this is after three and a half hours
1097.517	in an fMRI,
1099.484	it's like coming out of a space ship.
1104.16	Also, it has been shown in other labs --
1106.16	for instance,
1106.16	Paul Ekman's labs in Berkeley --
1110.16	that some meditators are able, also,
1112.719	to control their emotional response
1112.719	more than it could be thought.
1116.557	Like the startle experiments, for example.
1118.596	If you sit a guy on a chair
1120.151	with all this apparatus
1120.151	measuring your physiology,
1122.604	and there's kind of a bomb that goes off,
1124.596	it's such an instinctive response that,
1127.16	in 20 years, they never saw
1127.16	anyone who would not jump.
1131.616	Some meditators,
1131.616	without trying to stop it,
1134.16	but simply by being completely open,
1136.558	thinking that that bang is just going
1136.558	to be a small event like a shooting star,
1142.16	they are able not to move at all.
1144.16	So the whole point of that is not,
1144.16	sort of, to make, like,
1148.16	a circus thing of showing exceptional
1148.16	beings who can jump, or whatever.
1154.985	It's more to say
1154.985	that mind training matters.
1158.351	That this is not just a luxury.
1161.658	This is not a supplementary
1161.658	vitamin for the soul.
1166.08	This is something
1166.08	that's going to determine
1169.836	the quality of every instant of our lives.
1171.921	We are ready to spend 15 years
1171.921	achieving education.
1176.16	We love to do jogging, fitness.
1179.16	We do all kinds of things
1179.16	to remain beautiful.
1183.072	Yet, we spend surprisingly little time
1183.072	taking care of what matters most --
1190.073	the way our mind functions --
1192.341	which, again, is the ultimate thing
1196.112	that determines
1196.112	the quality of our experience.
1198.775	Now, compassion
1198.775	is supposed to be put in action.
1202.032	That's what we try to do
1202.032	in different places.
1205.16	Just this one example
1205.16	is worth a lot of work.
1209.456	This lady with bone TB,
1209.456	left alone in a tent,
1212.362	was going to die with her only daughter.
1215.588	One year later, how she is.
1220.16	Different schools and clinics
1220.16	we've been doing in Tibet.
1226.639	And just, I leave you
1226.639	with the beauty of those looks
1230.869	that tells more about happiness
1230.869	than I could ever say.
1234.902	(Laughter)
1236.069	And jumping monks of Tibet.
1237.553	(Laughter)
1239.16	Flying monks.
1248.134	Thank you very much.
