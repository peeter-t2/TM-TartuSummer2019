12.77	This is a lot of ones and zeros.
15.032	It's what we call binary information.
18.131	This is how computers talk.
19.573	It's how they store information.
21.502	It's how computers think.
23.128	It's how computers do
24.747	everything it is that computers do.
27.129	I'm a cybersecurity researcher,
29.176	which means my job is to sit
29.176	down with this information
31.246	and try to make sense of it,
32.93	to try to understand what all
32.93	the ones and zeroes mean.
35.683	Unfortunately for me, we're not just talking
37.526	about the ones and zeros
37.526	I have on the screen here.
39.76	We're not just talking about a
39.76	few pages of ones and zeros.
42.443	We're talking about billions and billions
45.052	of ones and zeros,
46.385	more than anyone could possibly comprehend.
49.026	Now, as exciting as that sounds,
50.885	when I first started doing cyber —
53.377	(Laughter) —
55.12	when I first started doing cyber, I wasn't sure
57.123	that sifting through ones and zeros
58.596	was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life,
60.89	because in my mind, cyber
62.91	was keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer,
66.591	it was keeping people's Myspace
66.591	pages from being hacked,
69.939	and maybe, maybe on my most glorious day,
72.124	it was keeping someone's credit
72.124	card information from being stolen.
75.875	Those are important things,
77.238	but that's not how I wanted to spend my life.
79.996	But after 30 minutes of work
81.93	as a defense contractor,
83.283	I soon found out that my idea of cyber
86.073	was a little bit off.
87.942	In fact, in terms of national security,
89.887	keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer
91.958	was surprisingly low on their priority list.
95.144	And the reason for that is cyber
96.445	is so much bigger than any one of those things.
100.238	Cyber is an integral part of all of our lives,
103.063	because computers are an
103.063	integral part of all of our lives,
106.123	even if you don't own a computer.
108.075	Computers control everything in your car,
110.721	from your GPS to your airbags.
112.601	They control your phone.
113.917	They're the reason you can call 911
115.088	and get someone on the other line.
116.884	They control our nation's entire infrastructure.
119.678	They're the reason you have electricity,
121.354	heat, clean water, food.
123.692	Computers control our military equipment,
125.593	everything from missile silos to satellites
127.27	to nuclear defense networks.
131.184	All of these things are made possible
133.173	because of computers,
134.589	and therefore because of cyber,
136.572	and when something goes wrong,
138.076	cyber can make all of these things impossible.
141.194	But that's where I step in.
142.779	A big part of my job is defending all of these things,
145.719	keeping them working,
147.381	but once in a while, part of my
147.381	job is to break one of these things,
149.709	because cyber isn't just about defense,
152.105	it's also about offense.
154.378	We're entering an age where we talk about
155.954	cyberweapons.
157.415	In fact, so great is the potential for cyber offense
160.55	that cyber is considered a new domain of warfare.
164.171	Warfare.
165.971	It's not necessarily a bad thing.
167.9	On the one hand, it means we have whole new front
170.651	on which we need to defend ourselves,
172.394	but on the other hand,
173.879	it means we have a whole new way to attack,
175.721	a whole new way to stop evil people
177.58	from doing evil things.
179.807	So let's consider an example of this
181.618	that's completely theoretical.
183.307	Suppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building,
185.565	and he wants to do this again and again
187.633	in the future.
189.084	So he doesn't want to be in
189.084	that building when it explodes.
191.924	He's going to use a cell phone
193.442	as a remote detonator.
195.777	Now, it used to be the only way we had
197.648	to stop this terrorist
199.284	was with a hail of bullets and a car chase,
201.957	but that's not necessarily true anymore.
204.289	We're entering an age where we can stop him
205.852	with the press of a button
206.962	from 1,000 miles away,
208.969	because whether he knew it or not,
210.558	as soon as he decided to use his cell phone,
212.269	he stepped into the realm of cyber.
215.403	A well-crafted cyber attack
215.403	could break into his phone,
218.52	disable the overvoltage protections on his battery,
220.669	drastically overload the circuit,
222.424	cause the battery to overheat, and explode.
224.781	No more phone, no more detonator,
227.227	maybe no more terrorist,
229.15	all with the press of a button
230.181	from a thousand miles away.
232.861	So how does this work?
234.612	It all comes back to those ones and zeros.
236.88	Binary information makes your phone work,
239.885	and used correctly, it can make your phone explode.
243.469	So when you start to look at
243.469	cyber from this perspective,
245.941	spending your life sifting through binary information
249.104	starts to seem kind of exciting.
251.521	But here's the catch: This is hard,
254.167	really, really hard,
255.852	and here's why.
257.686	Think about everything you have on your cell phone.
260.452	You've got the pictures you've taken.
262.415	You've got the music you listen to.
264.201	You've got your contacts list,
265.849	your email, and probably 500 apps
267.474	you've never used in your entire life,
270.475	and behind all of this is the software, the code,
274.462	that controls your phone,
275.842	and somewhere, buried inside of that code,
278.498	is a tiny piece that controls your battery,
281.046	and that's what I'm really after,
282.917	but all of this, just a bunch of ones and zeros,
286.603	and it's all just mixed together.
288.134	In cyber, we call this finding a
288.134	needle in a stack of needles,
291.679	because everything pretty much looks alike.
294.028	I'm looking for one key piece,
295.76	but it just blends in with everything else.
298.994	So let's step back from this theoretical situation
301.246	of making a terrorist's phone explode,
303.59	and look at something that actually happened to me.
306.406	Pretty much no matter what I do,
307.749	my job always starts with sitting down
309.191	with a whole bunch of binary information,
311.563	and I'm always looking for one key piece
313.29	to do something specific.
315.277	In this case, I was looking for a very advanced,
317.354	very high-tech piece of code
318.872	that I knew I could hack,
320.087	but it was somewhere buried
321.801	inside of a billion ones and zeroes.
323.827	Unfortunately for me, I didn't know
325.405	quite what I was looking for.
327.096	I didn't know quite what it would look like,
328.292	which makes finding it really, really hard.
331.21	When I have to do that, what I have to do
333.249	is basically look at various pieces
335.591	of this binary information,
337.314	try to decipher each piece, and see if it might be
339.516	what I'm after.
340.74	So after a while, I thought I had found the piece
342.365	I was looking for.
343.702	I thought maybe this was it.
345.806	It seemed to be about right, but I couldn't quite tell.
347.838	I couldn't tell what those
347.838	ones and zeros represented.
350.756	So I spent some time trying to put this together,
354.13	but wasn't having a whole lot of luck,
355.8	and finally I decided,
356.986	I'm going to get through this,
358.595	I'm going to come in on a weekend,
360.106	and I'm not going to leave
361.446	until I figure out what this represents.
363.158	So that's what I did. I came
363.158	in on a Saturday morning,
365.324	and about 10 hours in, I sort of
365.324	had all the pieces to the puzzle.
368.969	I just didn't know how they fit together.
370.361	I didn't know what these ones and zeros meant.
373.151	At the 15-hour mark,
375.218	I started to get a better picture of what was there,
377.82	but I had a creeping suspicion
379.592	that what I was looking at
381.181	was not at all related to what I was looking for.
384.104	By 20 hours, the pieces started to come together
386.591	very slowly — (Laughter) —
390.355	and I was pretty sure I was going down
391.621	the wrong path at this point,
393.56	but I wasn't going to give up.
395.811	After 30 hours in the lab,
398.645	I figured out exactly what I was looking at,
400.906	and I was right, it wasn't what I was looking for.
403.724	I spent 30 hours piecing together
405.423	the ones and zeros that
405.423	formed a picture of a kitten.
408.145	(Laughter)
409.94	I wasted 30 hours of my life searching for this kitten
413.746	that had nothing at all to do
415.584	with what I was trying to accomplish.
417.571	So I was frustrated, I was exhausted.
421.434	After 30 hours in the lab, I probably smelled horrible.
424.66	But instead of just going home
426.89	and calling it quits, I took a step back
429.42	and asked myself, what went wrong here?
431.961	How could I make such a stupid mistake?
434.173	I'm really pretty good at this.
435.571	I do this for a living.
436.89	So what happened?
439.038	Well I thought, when you're
439.038	looking at information at this level,
441.813	it's so easy to lose track of what you're doing.
444.64	It's easy to not see the forest through the trees.
446.384	It's easy to go down the wrong rabbit hole
448.548	and waste a tremendous amount of time
450.31	doing the wrong thing.
452.13	But I had this epiphany.
453.73	We were looking at the data completely incorrectly
456.729	since day one.
458.219	This is how computers think, ones and zeros.
460.322	It's not how people think,
461.714	but we've been trying to adapt our minds
464.028	to think more like computers
465.373	so that we can understand this information.
467.97	Instead of trying to make our minds fit the problem,
469.92	we should have been making the problem
471.568	fit our minds,
472.537	because our brains have a tremendous potential
474.646	for analyzing huge amounts of information,
477.732	just not like this.
479.029	So what if we could unlock that potential
480.496	just by translating this
482.023	to the right kind of information?
484.871	So with these ideas in mind,
486.065	I sprinted out of my basement lab at work
487.683	to my basement lab at home,
488.99	which looked pretty much the same.
490.986	The main difference is, at work,
492.81	I'm surrounded by cyber materials,
494.389	and cyber seemed to be the
494.389	problem in this situation.
496.994	At home, I'm surrounded by
496.994	everything else I've ever learned.
500.347	So I poured through every book I could find,
502.219	every idea I'd ever encountered,
503.551	to see how could we translate a problem
505.697	from one domain to something completely different?
508.829	The biggest question was,
510.223	what do we want to translate it to?
512.191	What do our brains do perfectly naturally
514.303	that we could exploit?
516.181	My answer was vision.
518.47	We have a tremendous capability
518.47	to analyze visual information.
521.619	We can combine color gradients, depth cues,
524.202	all sorts of these different signals
525.99	into one coherent picture of the world around us.
528.385	That's incredible.
529.792	So if we could find a way to translate
531.173	these binary patterns to visual signals,
533.359	we could really unlock the power of our brains
535.191	to process this stuff.
537.901	So I started looking at the binary information,
539.744	and I asked myself, what do I do
540.834	when I first encounter something like this?
542.71	And the very first thing I want to do,
544.333	the very first question I want to answer,
545.692	is what is this?
546.97	I don't care what it does, how it works.
549.498	All I want to know is, what is this?
551.977	And the way I can figure that out
553.652	is by looking at chunks,
555.335	sequential chunks of binary information,
557.788	and I look at the relationships
557.788	between those chunks.
560.69	When I gather up enough of these sequences,
562.462	I begin to get an idea of exactly
564.466	what this information must be.
567.1	So let's go back to that
568.284	blow up the terrorist's phone situation.
570.374	This is what English text looks like
572.577	at a binary level.
573.89	This is what your contacts list would look like
576.216	if I were examining it.
577.776	It's really hard to analyze this at this level,
580.01	but if we take those same binary chunks
582.114	that I would be trying to find,
583.296	and instead translate that
585.06	to a visual representation,
586.98	translate those relationships,
588.777	this is what we get.
590.333	This is what English text looks like
592.247	from a visual abstraction perspective.
594.918	All of a sudden,
596.058	it shows us all the same information
597.493	that was in the ones and zeros,
598.665	but show us it in an entirely different way,
600.986	a way that we can immediately comprehend.
602.703	We can instantly see all of the patterns here.
605.668	It takes me seconds to pick out patterns here,
608.26	but hours, days, to pick them out
610.514	in ones and zeros.
611.834	It takes minutes for anybody to learn
613.57	what these patterns represent here,
615.235	but years of experience in cyber
617.482	to learn what those same patterns represent
619.136	in ones and zeros.
620.722	So this piece is caused by
622.384	lower case letters followed by lower case letters
624.408	inside of that contact list.
626.175	This is upper case by upper case,
627.516	upper case by lower case, lower case by upper case.
630.201	This is caused by spaces. This
630.201	is caused by carriage returns.
632.887	We can go through every little detail
634.395	of the binary information in seconds,
637.361	as opposed to weeks, months, at this level.
640.895	This is what an image looks like
642.407	from your cell phone.
644.283	But this is what it looks like
645.296	in a visual abstraction.
647.187	This is what your music looks like,
649.172	but here's its visual abstraction.
651.375	Most importantly for me,
653.135	this is what the code on your cell phone looks like.
656.41	This is what I'm after in the end,
658.567	but this is its visual abstraction.
660.707	If I can find this, I can't make the phone explode.
663.216	I could spend weeks trying to find this
665.835	in ones and zeros,
667.012	but it takes me seconds to pick out
668.796	a visual abstraction like this.
672.1	One of those most remarkable parts about all of this
674.592	is it gives us an entirely new way to understand
677.424	new information, stuff that we haven't seen before.
680.663	So I know what English looks like at a binary level,
683.167	and I know what its visual abstraction looks like,
685.277	but I've never seen Russian binary in my entire life.
688.592	It would take me weeks just to figure out
690.392	what I was looking at from raw ones and zeros,
693.389	but because our brains can instantly pick up
695.14	and recognize these subtle patterns inside
697.957	of these visual abstractions,
699.445	we can unconsciously apply those
701.277	in new situations.
702.85	So this is what Russian looks like
704.332	in a visual abstraction.
705.912	Because I know what one language looks like,
707.716	I can recognize other languages
709.292	even when I'm not familiar with them.
711.162	This is what a photograph looks like,
712.948	but this is what clip art looks like.
714.835	This is what the code on your phone looks like,
717.39	but this is what the code on
717.39	your computer looks like.
720.097	Our brains can pick up on these patterns
721.961	in ways that we never could have
723.912	from looking at raw ones and zeros.
726.408	But we've really only scratched the surface
728.264	of what we can do with this approach.
730.401	We've only begun to unlock the capabilities
732.079	of our minds to process visual information.
735.394	If we take those same concepts and translate them
737.384	into three dimensions instead,
739.035	we find entirely new ways of
739.035	making sense of information.
742.23	In seconds, we can pick out every pattern here.
744.715	we can see the cross associated with code.
746.535	We can see cubes associated with text.
748.467	We can even pick up the tiniest visual artifacts.
750.943	Things that would take us weeks,
753.073	months to find in ones and zeroes,
755.267	are immediately apparent
757.07	in some sort of visual abstraction,
759.34	and as we continue to go through this
760.472	and throw more and more information at it,
762.488	what we find is that we're capable of processing
764.769	billions of ones and zeros
767.185	in a matter of seconds
768.353	just by using our brain's built-in ability
771.587	to analyze patterns.
773.541	So this is really nice and helpful,
775.844	but all this tells me is what I'm looking at.
778.203	So at this point, based on visual patterns,
779.687	I can find the code on the phone.
782.096	But that's not enough to blow up a battery.
784.761	The next thing I need to find is the code
786.329	that controls the battery, but we're back
788.09	to the needle in a stack of needles problem.
789.821	That code looks pretty much like all the other code
792.21	on that system.
794.448	So I might not be able to find the
794.448	code that controls the battery,
796.849	but there's a lot of things
796.849	that are very similar to that.
798.86	You have code that controls your screen,
800.714	that controls your buttons,
800.714	that controls your microphones,
802.93	so even if I can't find the code for the battery,
804.858	I bet I can find one of those things.
807.103	So the next step in my binary analysis process
809.808	is to look at pieces of information
811.039	that are similar to each other.
813.057	It's really, really hard to do at a binary level,
817.04	but if we translate those similarities
817.04	to a visual abstraction instead,
820.683	I don't even have to sift through the raw data.
823.121	All I have to do is wait for the image to light up
825.276	to see when I'm at similar pieces.
827.512	I follow these strands of similarity
827.512	like a trail of bread crumbs
830.54	to find exactly what I'm looking for.
833.646	So at this point in the process,
835.38	I've located the code
836.698	responsible for controlling your battery,
838.383	but that's still not enough to blow up a phone.
840.959	The last piece of the puzzle
842.523	is understanding how that code
845.202	controls your battery.
846.404	For this, I need to identify
848.792	very subtle, very detailed relationships
850.508	within that binary information,
852.597	another very hard thing to do
854.352	when looking at ones and zeros.
856.664	But if we translate that information
858.06	into a physical representation,
860.24	we can sit back and let our
860.24	visual cortex do all the hard work.
863.256	It can find all the detailed patterns,
864.99	all the important pieces, for us.
867.01	It can find out exactly how the pieces of that code
869.603	work together to control that battery.
872.537	All of this can be done in a matter of hours,
875.541	whereas the same process
876.897	would have taken months in the past.
879.819	This is all well and good
881.008	in a theoretical blow up a terrorist's phone situation.
883.95	I wanted to find out if this would really work
886.797	in the work I do every day.
889.426	So I was playing around with these same concepts
892.481	with some of the data I've looked at in the past,
895.505	and yet again, I was trying to find
897.997	a very detailed, specific piece of code
900.205	inside of a massive piece of binary information.
903.8	So I looked at it at this level,
905.573	thinking I was looking at the right thing,
907.523	only to see this doesn't have
909.844	the connectivity I would have expected
911.584	for the code I was looking for.
913.489	In fact, I'm not really sure what this is,
916.092	but when I stepped back a level
917.104	and looked at the similarities within the code
918.819	I saw, this doesn't have similarities
921.113	like any code that exists out there.
922.604	I can't even be looking at code.
924.829	In fact, from this perspective,
927.215	I could tell, this isn't code.
929.263	This is an image of some sort.
931.311	And from here, I can see,
932.993	it's not just an image, this is a photograph.
935.904	Now that I know it's a photograph,
937.296	I've got dozens of other
937.296	binary translation techniques
940.226	to visualize and understand that information,
942.647	so in a matter of seconds,
942.647	we can take this information,
945.19	shove it through a dozen other
945.19	visual translation techniques
947.587	in order to find out exactly what we were looking at.
951.318	I saw — (Laughter) —
953	it was that darn kitten again.
956.456	All this is enabled
957.506	because we were able to find a way
959.001	to translate a very hard problem
961.03	to something our brains do very naturally.
963.542	So what does this mean?
965.78	Well, for kittens, it means
967.325	no more hiding in ones and zeros.
969.742	For me, it means no more wasted weekends.
973.045	For cyber, it means we have a radical new way
975.657	to tackle the most impossible problems.
978.622	It means we have a new weapon
980.434	in the evolving theater of cyber warfare,
982.85	but for all of us,
984.27	it means that cyber engineers
985.745	now have the ability to become first responders
987.891	in emergency situations.
990.474	When seconds count,
991.521	we've unlocked the means to stop the bad guys.
994.93	Thank you.
996.93	(Applause)
