15.26	I'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist,
17.26	so I put children to sleep for a living.
19.26	(Laughter)
21.26	And I'm an academic, so I put audiences to sleep for free.
24.26	(Laughter)
28.26	But what I actually mostly do
30.26	is I manage the pain management service
32.26	at the Packard Children's Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto.
35.26	And it's from the experience
37.26	from about 20 or 25 years of doing that
39.26	that I want to bring to you the message this morning,
41.26	that pain is a disease.
43.26	Now most of the time,
45.26	you think of pain as a symptom of a disease,
47.26	and that's true most of the time.
49.26	It's the symptom of a tumor or an infection
52.26	or an inflammation or an operation.
54.26	But about 10 percent of the time,
57.26	after the patient has recovered from one of those events,
60.26	pain persists.
62.26	It persists for months
64.26	and oftentimes for years,
66.26	and when that happens,
68.26	it is its own disease.
70.26	And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens
73.26	and what we can do about it,
75.26	I want to show you how it feels for my patients.
78.26	So imagine, if you will,
80.26	that I'm stroking your arm with this feather,
82.26	as I'm stroking my arm right now.
85.26	Now, I want you to imagine
87.26	that I'm stroking it with this.
89.26	Please keep your seat.
91.26	(Laughter)
93.26	A very different feeling.
95.26	Now what does it have to do with chronic pain?
97.26	Imagine, if you will, these two ideas together.
100.26	Imagine what your life would be like
102.26	if I were to stroke it with this feather,
105.26	but your brain was telling you
107.26	that this is what you are feeling --
109.26	and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain.
112.26	In fact, imagine something even worse.
114.26	Imagine I were to stroke your child's arm with this feather,
117.26	and their brain [was] telling them
119.26	that they were feeling this hot torch.
122.26	That was the experience of my patient, Chandler,
124.26	whom you see in the photograph.
126.26	As you can see, she's a beautiful, young woman.
128.26	She was 16 years old last year when I met her,
130.26	and she aspired to be a professional dancer.
133.26	And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals,
135.26	she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist.
138.26	Now you would probably imagine, as she did,
140.26	that a wrist sprain is a trivial event
142.26	in a person's life.
144.26	Wrap it in an ACE bandage,
146.26	take some ibuprofen for a week or two,
148.26	and that's the end of the story.
150.26	But in Chandler's case, that was the beginning of the story.
154.26	This is what her arm looked like
156.26	when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain.
159.26	You can see that the arm is discolored,
161.26	purplish in color.
163.26	It was cadaverically cold to the touch.
165.26	The muscles were frozen, paralyzed --
167.26	dystonic is how we refer to that.
170.26	The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands,
173.26	to her fingertips, from her wrist up to her elbow,
176.26	almost all the way to her shoulder.
178.26	But the worst part was,
180.26	not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day.
183.26	The worst part was that she had allodynia,
186.26	the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated
189.26	with the feather and with the torch.
191.26	The lightest touch of her arm --
193.26	the touch of a hand,
195.26	the touch even of a sleeve, of a garment, as she put it on --
198.26	caused excruciating, burning pain.
202.26	How can the nervous system get this so wrong?
205.26	How can the nervous system
207.26	misinterpret an innocent sensation
209.26	like the touch of a hand
211.26	and turn it into the malevolent sensation
214.26	of the touch of the flame?
216.26	Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body
219.26	is hardwired like your house.
221.26	In your house, wires run in the wall,
223.26	from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling
226.26	and from the junction box to the light bulb.
229.26	And when you turn the switch on, the light goes on.
231.26	And when you turn the switch off, the light goes off.
234.26	So people imagine the nervous system is just like that.
238.26	If you hit your thumb with a hammer,
240.26	these wires in your arm -- that, of course, we call nerves --
243.26	transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord
246.26	where new wires, new nerves,
248.26	take the information up to the brain
250.26	where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt.
254.26	But the situation, of course, in the human body
256.26	is far more complicated than that.
259.26	Instead of it being the case
261.26	that that junction box in the spinal cord
263.26	is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve
266.26	by releasing these little brown packets
268.26	of chemical information called neurotransmitters
271.26	in a linear one-on-one fashion,
274.26	in fact, what happens
276.26	is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions --
278.26	laterally, vertically, up and down in the spinal cord --
281.26	and they start interacting
283.26	with other adjacent cells.
286.26	These cells, called glial cells,
288.26	were once thought to be
290.26	unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord
292.26	that did nothing more than hold all the important things together,
294.26	like the nerves.
296.26	But it turns out
298.26	the glial cells have a vital role
300.26	in the modulation, amplification
302.26	and, in the case of pain, the distortion
305.26	of sensory experiences.
308.26	These glial cells become activated.
310.26	Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins,
312.26	which spill out
314.26	and interact with adjacent nerves,
316.26	and they start releasing their neurotransmitters,
319.26	and those neurotransmitters spill out
321.26	and activate adjacent glial cells, and so on and so forth,
324.26	until what we have
326.26	is a positive feedback loop.
328.26	It's almost as if somebody came into your home
330.26	and rewired your walls
332.26	so that the next time you turned on the light switch,
334.26	the toilet flushed three doors down,
336.26	or your dishwasher went on,
338.26	or your computer monitor turned off.
340.26	That's crazy,
342.26	but that's, in fact, what happens
344.26	with chronic pain.
346.26	And that's why pain becomes its own disease.
349.26	The nervous system has plasticity.
351.26	It changes, and it morphs
353.26	in response to stimuli.
355.26	Well, what do we do about that?
357.26	What can we do in a case like Chandler's?
360.26	We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion
362.26	at this point in time.
364.26	We treat them with symptom-modifying drugs --
367.26	painkillers --
369.26	which are, frankly, not very effective
371.26	for this kind of pain.
373.26	We take nerves that are noisy and active
375.26	that should be quiet,
377.26	and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics.
379.26	And most importantly, what we do
382.26	is we use a rigorous, and often uncomfortable, process
386.26	of physical therapy and occupational therapy
389.26	to retrain the nerves in the nervous system
392.26	to respond normally
395.26	to the activities and sensory experiences
398.26	that are part of everyday life.
400.26	And we support all of that
402.26	with an intensive psychotherapy program
405.26	to address the despondency, despair and depression
408.26	that always accompanies
410.26	severe, chronic pain.
412.26	It's successful,
414.26	as you can see from this video of Chandler,
416.26	who, two months after we first met her,
418.26	is now doings a back flip.
420.26	And I had lunch with her yesterday
422.26	because she's a college student studying dance at Long Beach here,
425.26	and she's doing absolutely fantastic.
427.26	But the future is actually even brighter.
431.26	The future holds the promise
434.26	that new drugs will be developed
436.26	that are not symptom-modifying drugs
439.26	that simply mask the problem,
441.26	as we have now,
443.26	but that will be disease-modifying drugs
446.26	that will actually go right to the root of the problem
448.26	and attack those glial cells,
450.26	or those pernicious proteins
452.26	that the glial cells elaborate,
455.26	that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up,
458.26	or plasticity,
460.26	that so is capable
462.26	of distorting and amplifying
464.26	the sensory experience that we call pain.
466.26	So I have hope
468.26	that in the future,
470.26	the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized,
473.26	"who said, ""My philosophy:"
475.26	"No pain, no pain."""
479.26	Thank you very much.
481.26	(Applause)
