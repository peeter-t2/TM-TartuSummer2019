25	This song is one of Thomas' favorites,
28	"called ""What You Do with What You've Got."""
46	♫ You must know someone like him ♫
49	♫ He was tall and strong and lean ♫
52	♫ With a body like a greyhound ♫
55	♫ and a mind so sharp and keen ♫
59	♫ But his heart, just like laurel ♫
62	♫ grew twisted around itself ♫
65	♫ Till almost everything he did ♫
68	♫ brought pain to someone else ♫
75	♫ It's not just what you're born with ♫
78	♫ It's what you choose to bear ♫
81	♫ It's not how big your share is ♫
85	♫ It's how much you can share ♫
88	♫ It's not the fights you dreamed of ♫
91	♫ It's those you really fought ♫
94	♫ It's not what you've been given ♫
97	♫ It's what you do with what you've got ♫
105	♫ What's the use of two strong legs ♫
109	♫ if you only run away? ♫
112	♫ And what's the use of the finest voice ♫
115	♫ if you've nothing good to say? ♫
118	♫ What's the use of strength and muscle ♫
122	♫ if you only push and shove? ♫
125	♫ And what's the use of two good ears ♫
128	♫ if you can't hear those you love? ♫
191	♫ What's the use of two strong legs ♫
196	♫ if you only run away? ♫
198	♫ And what's the use of the finest voice ♫
201	♫ if you've nothing good to say? ♫
204	♫ What's the use of strength and muscle ♫
208	♫ if you only push and shove? ♫
211	♫ And what's the use of two good ears ♫
214	♫ if you can't hear those you love? ♫
217	♫ Between those who use their neighbors ♫
220	♫ and those who use the cane ♫
223	♫ Between those in constant power ♫
226	♫ and those in constant pain ♫
229	♫ Between those who run to glory ♫
232	♫ and those who cannot run ♫
235	♫ Tell me which ones are the cripples ♫
238	♫ and which ones touch the sun ♫
275	♫ Which ones touch the sun ♫
280	♫ Which ones touch the sun ♫
305	(Applause) Thank you very much.
