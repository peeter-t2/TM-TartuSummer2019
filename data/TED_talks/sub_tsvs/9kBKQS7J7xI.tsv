12.884	So I'm an artist,
14.656	but a little bit of a peculiar one.
16.386	I don't paint.
18.434	I can't draw.
20.153	My shop teacher in high school
20.153	wrote that I was a menace
24.122	on my report card.
25.953	You probably don't really
25.953	want to see my photographs.
29.991	But there is one thing I know how to do:
31.98	I know how to program a computer.
33.663	I can code.
34.899	And people will tell me
34.899	that 100 years ago,
38.196	folks like me didn't exist,
39.57	that it was impossible,
41.684	that art made with data is a new thing,
44.658	it's a product of our age,
46.824	it's something that's really important
48.735	to think of as something
48.735	"that's very ""now."""
50.837	And that's true.
52.029	But there is an art form
52.029	that's been around for a very long time
56.163	that's really about using information,
58.058	abstract information,
60.168	to make emotionally resonant pieces.
63.08	And it's called music.
65.632	We've been making music
65.632	for tens of thousands of years, right?
69.528	And if you think about what music is --
71.512	notes and chords and keys
71.512	and harmonies and melodies --
74.36	these things are algorithms.
75.79	These things are systems
77.641	that are designed to unfold over time,
80.049	to make us feel.
82.195	I came to the arts through music.
83.831	I was trained as a composer,
85.243	and about 15 years ago,
85.243	I started making pieces
88.549	that were designed to look
88.549	at the intersection
91.108	between sound and image,
93.036	to use an image to unveil
93.036	a musical structure
95.892	or to use a sound to show you
95.892	something interesting
98.78	about something that's usually pictorial.
100.804	So what you're seeing on the screen
100.804	is literally being drawn
104.295	by the musical structure
104.295	of the musicians onstage,
107.261	and there's no accident
107.261	that it looks like a plant,
109.817	because the underlying
109.817	algorithmic biology of the plant
113.18	is what informed the musical structure
113.18	in the first place.
116.515	So once you know how to do this,
116.515	once you know how to code with media,
119.943	you can do some pretty cool stuff.
122.055	This is a project I did
122.055	for the Sundance Film Festival.
125.905	Really simple idea: you take
125.905	every Academy Award Best Picture,
131.178	you speed it up to one minute each
133.563	and string them all together.
135.168	And so in 75 minutes, I can show you
135.168	the history of Hollywood cinema.
139.592	And what it really shows you
139.592	is the history of editing
142.595	in Hollywood cinema.
143.8	So on the left, we've got Casablanca;
143.8	on the right, we've got Chicago.
147.972	And you can see that Casablanca
147.972	is a little easier to read.
150.92	That's because the average length
150.92	of a cinematic shot in the 1940s
154.276	was 26 seconds,
155.939	and now it's around six seconds.
158.999	This is a project that was inspired
160.767	by some work that was funded
160.767	by the US Federal Government
163.735	in the early 2000s,
164.928	to look at video footage and find
164.928	a specific actor in any video.
171.605	And so I repurposed this code
171.605	to train a system on one person
176.305	in our culture who would never need
176.305	to be surveilled in that manner,
180.176	which is Britney Spears.
181.727	I downloaded 2,000 paparazzi
181.727	photos of Britney Spears
185.243	and trained my computer to find her face
187.743	and her face alone.
189.148	I can run any footage of her through it
189.148	and will center her eyes in the frame,
193.448	and this sort of is a little
193.448	double commentary
195.648	about surveillance in our society.
197.696	We are very fraught with anxiety
197.696	about being watched,
200.712	but then we obsess over celebrity.
204.219	What you're seeing on the screen here
204.219	is a collaboration I did
207.973	with an artist named Li√°n Amaris.
210.553	What she did is very simple
210.553	to explain and describe,
214.451	but very hard to do.
215.707	She took 72 minutes of activity,
219.208	getting ready for a night out on the town,
221.805	and stretched it over three days
223.918	and performed it on a traffic island
223.918	in slow motion in New York City.
227.949	I was there, too, with a film crew.
230.192	We filmed the whole thing,
231.468	and then we reversed the process,
231.468	speeding it up to 72 minutes again,
234.893	so it looks like she's moving normally
236.811	and the whole world is flying by.
239.091	At a certain point, I figured out
241.691	that what I was doing
241.691	was making portraits.
245.5	When you think about portraiture,
245.5	you tend to think about stuff like this.
249.086	The guy on the left
249.086	is named Gilbert Stuart.
251.173	He's sort of the first real portraitist
251.173	of the United States.
254.261	And on the right is his portrait
254.261	of George Washington from 1796.
257.51	This is the so-called Lansdowne portrait.
259.732	And if you look at this painting,
259.732	there's a lot of symbolism, right?
262.996	We've got a rainbow out the window.
262.996	We've got a sword.
265.68	We've got a quill on the desk.
267.159	All of these things are meant to evoke
269.032	George Washington
269.032	as the father of the nation.
271.832	This is my portrait of George Washington.
275.776	And this is an eye chart,
278.809	only instead of letters, they're words.
281.713	And what the words are is the 66 words
284.439	in George Washington's
284.439	State of the Union addresses
286.923	that he uses more
286.923	than any other president.
290.02	"So ""gentlemen"" has its own symbolism"
290.02	and its own rhetoric.
294.246	And it's really kind of significant
294.246	that that's the word he used the most.
298.862	This is the eye chart for George W. Bush,
301.005	who was president when I made this piece.
304.009	And how you get there,
305.201	"from ""gentlemen"" to ""terror"""
305.201	in 43 easy steps,
308.677	tells us a lot about American history,
310.761	and gives you a different insight
312.372	than you would have
312.372	looking at a series of paintings.
315.333	These pieces provide a history lesson
315.333	of the United States
319.291	through the political
319.291	rhetoric of its leaders.
321.571	Ronald Reagan spent a lot of time
321.571	talking about deficits.
325.135	Bill Clinton spent a lot of time
326.724	talking about the century in which
326.724	he would no longer be president,
330.032	but maybe his wife would be.
333.148	Lyndon Johnson was the first President
335.808	to give his State of the Union addresses
335.808	on prime-time television;
339.014	he began every paragraph
339.014	"with the word ""tonight."""
341.378	And Richard Nixon,
341.378	or more accurately, his speechwriter,
344.068	a guy named William Safire,
345.42	spent a lot of time
345.42	thinking about language
347.492	and making sure that his boss
347.492	portrayed a rhetoric of honesty.
351.449	This project is shown
351.449	as a series of monolithic sculptures.
354.375	It's an outdoor series of light boxes.
356.847	And it's important to note
356.847	that they're to scale,
359.301	so if you stand 20 feet back and you can
359.301	read between those two black lines,
362.939	you have 20/20 vision.
364.114	(Laughter)
365.176	This is a portrait.
365.176	And there's a lot of these.
367.505	There's a lot of ways
367.505	to do this with data.
370.791	I started looking for a way
372.435	to think about how I can do
372.435	a more democratic form of portraiture,
377.164	something that's more about
377.164	my country and how it works.
381.419	Every 10 years, we make a census
381.419	in the United States.
385.244	We literally count people,
387.306	find out who lives where,
387.306	what kind of jobs we've got,
390.474	the language we speak at home.
391.975	And this is important stuff --
391.975	really important stuff.
394.57	But it doesn't really tell us who we are.
396.827	It doesn't tell us about our dreams
396.827	and our aspirations.
399.522	And so in 2010, I decided
399.522	to make my own census.
402.936	And I started looking for a corpus of data
406.28	that had a lot of descriptions
406.28	written by ordinary Americans.
409.416	And it turns out
410.591	that there is such a corpus of data
412.357	that's just sitting there for the taking.
414.365	It's called online dating.
416.574	So in 2010, I joined 21 different
416.574	online dating services,
421.544	as a gay man, a straight man,
421.544	a gay woman and a straight woman,
424.668	in every zip code in America
426.309	and downloaded about
429.518	about 20 percent of the adult population
429.518	of the United States.
433.241	I have obsessive-compulsive disorder.
435.084	This is going to become
435.084	really freaking obvious. Just go with me.
438.209	(Laughter)
439.375	So what I did was I sorted
439.375	all this stuff by zip code.
443.922	And I looked at word analysis.
445.437	These are some dating profiles from 2010
448.134	"with the word ""lonely"" highlighted."
450.253	If you look at these things
450.253	topographically,
453.258	if you imagine dark colors to light colors
453.258	are more use of the word,
456.782	you can see that Appalachia
456.782	is a pretty lonely place.
461.979	You can also see
461.979	that Nebraska ain't that funny.
468.385	This is the kinky map,
468.385	so what this is showing you
474.033	is that the women in Alaska
474.033	need to get together
477.16	with the men in southern New Mexico,
478.959	and have a good time.
480.323	And I have this
480.323	at a pretty granular level,
483.213	so I can tell you that the men
483.213	in the eastern half of Long Island
486.344	are way more interested in being spanked
488.294	than men in the western half
488.294	of Long Island.
491.851	This will be your one takeaway
491.851	from this whole conference.
494.725	You're going to remember
494.725	that fact for, like, 30 years.
497.489	(Laughter)
500.655	When you bring this down
500.655	to a cartographic level,
503.102	you can make maps and do the same trick
503.102	I was doing with the eye charts.
506.58	You can replace the name
506.58	of every city in the United States
509.421	with the word people use more
509.421	in that city than anywhere else.
512.437	If you've ever dated anyone
512.437	from Seattle, this makes perfect sense.
515.69	"You've got ""pretty."""
515.69	"You've got ""heartbreak."""
518.416	"You've got ""gig."" You've got ""cigarette."""
520.855	They play in a band and they smoke.
523.604	"And right above that you can see ""email."""
525.612	That's Redmond, Washington,
526.942	which is the headquarters
526.942	of the Microsoft Corporation.
529.561	Some of these you can guess --
529.561	"so, Los Angeles is ""acting"""
532.409	"and San Francisco is ""gay."""
534.051	Some are a little bit more heartbreaking.
536.067	In Baton Rouge, they talk
536.067	about being curvy;
538.172	downstream in New Orleans,
538.172	they still talk about the flood.
541.083	Folks in the American capital
541.083	will say they're interesting.
543.912	People in Baltimore, Maryland,
543.912	will say they're afraid.
546.713	This is New Jersey.
548.274	I grew up somewhere
548.274	"between ""annoying"" and ""cynical."""
550.987	(Laughter) (Applause)
555.25	And New York City's
555.25	"number one word is ""now,"""
557.931	"as in, ""Now I'm working as a waiter,"
557.931	"but actually I'm an actor."""
561.201	(Laughter)
562.323	"Or, ""Now I'm a professor of engineering"
562.323	"at NYU, but actually I'm an artist."""
566.642	"If you go upstate, you see ""dinosaur."""
568.591	That's Syracuse.
569.766	The best place to eat
569.766	in Syracuse, New York,
571.863	is a Hell's Angels barbecue joint
571.863	called Dinosaur Barbecue.
574.681	That's where you would
574.681	take somebody on a date.
576.927	"I live somewhere between ""unconditional"""
576.927	"and ""midsummer,"" in Midtown Manhattan."
580.757	And this is gentrified North Brooklyn,
582.828	"so you've got ""DJ"" and ""glamorous"""
582.828	"and ""hipsters"" and ""urbane."""
586.048	So that's maybe
586.048	a more democratic portrait.
588.494	And the idea was, what if we made
588.494	red-state and blue-state maps
591.587	based on what we want to do
591.587	on a Friday night?
593.78	This is a self-portrait.
595.77	This is based on my email,
597.051	about 500,000 emails sent over 20 years.
600.044	You can think of this
600.044	as a quantified selfie.
603.021	So what I'm doing is running
603.021	a physics equation
606.139	based on my personal data.
607.561	You have to imagine everybody
607.561	I've ever corresponded with.
610.328	It started out in the middle
610.328	and it exploded with a big bang.
613.751	And everybody has gravity to one another,
615.953	gravity based on how much
615.953	they've been emailing,
618.238	who they've been emailing with.
619.77	And it also does sentimental analysis,
621.626	"so if I say ""I love you,"""
621.626	you're heavier to me.
623.939	And you attract to my email
623.939	addresses in the middle,
626.459	which act like mainline stars.
628.578	And all the names are handwritten.
630.917	Sometimes you do this data
630.917	and this work with real-time data
634.649	to illuminate a specific problem
634.649	in a specific city.
638.071	This is a Walther PPK 9mm
638.071	semiautomatic handgun
640.771	that was used in a shooting
640.771	in the French Quarter of New Orleans
643.826	about two years ago on Valentine's Day
643.826	in an argument over parking.
647.159	Those are my cigarettes.
648.398	This is the house
648.398	where the shooting took place.
650.697	This project involved
650.697	a little bit of engineering.
653.095	I've got a bike chain
653.095	rigged up as a cam shaft,
655.334	with a computer driving it.
656.674	That computer and the mechanism
656.674	are buried in a box.
659.464	The gun's on top welded to a steel plate.
661.702	There's a wire going
661.702	through to the trigger,
664.071	and the computer in the box is online.
666.286	It's listening to the 911 feed
666.286	of the New Orleans Police Department,
669.543	so that anytime there's a shooting
669.543	reported in New Orleans,
672.444	(Gunshot sound)
673.469	the gun fires.
675.3	Now, there's a blank,
675.3	so there's no bullet.
678.008	There's big light, big noise
680.106	and most importantly, there's a casing.
682.452	There's about five shootings
682.452	a day in New Orleans,
684.872	so over the four months
684.872	this piece was installed,
687.237	the case filled up with bullets.
689.642	You guys know what this is --
689.642	"you call this ""data visualization."""
694.559	When you do it right, it's illuminating.
696.591	When you do it wrong, it's anesthetizing.
699.656	It reduces people to numbers.
701.335	So watch out.
704.654	One last piece for you.
706.466	I spent the last summer
706.466	as the artist in residence
709.272	for Times Square.
710.932	And Times Square in New York
710.932	is literally the crossroads of the world.
714.599	One of the things
714.599	people don't notice about it
716.8	is it's the most Instagrammed
716.8	place on Earth.
719.903	About every five seconds,
719.903	someone commits a selfie
722.809	in Times Square.
724.424	That's 17,000 a day, and I have them all.
727.697	(Laughter)
728.806	These are some of them
728.806	with their eyes centered.
731.122	Every civilization,
732.183	will use the maximum level
732.183	of technology available to make art.
735.132	And it's the responsibility
735.132	of the artist to ask questions
737.964	about what that technology means
739.619	and how it reflects our culture.
741.662	So I leave you with this:
741.662	we're more than numbers.
744.172	We're people, and we have
744.172	dreams and ideas.
746.197	And reducing us to statistics
746.197	is something that's done
749.02	at our peril.
750.295	Thank you very much.
751.497	(Applause)
