16.982	So I want to talk today
16.982	about money and happiness,
19.419	which are two things a lot of us
19.419	spend a lot of our time thinking about,
23.001	either trying to earn them
23.001	or trying to increase them.
25.855	And a lot of us resonate with this phrase,
28.158	we see it in religions
28.158	and self-help books:
30.991	money can't buy happiness.
32.31	And I want to suggest today
32.31	that, in fact, that's wrong.
35.109	(Laughter)
37.184	I'm at a business school,
37.184	so that's what we do.
39.425	So that's wrong,
40.602	and in fact, if you think that,
40.602	you're just not spending it right.
43.849	So instead of spending it
43.849	the way you usually spend it,
46.521	maybe if you spent it differently,
46.521	that might work a little bit better.
50.032	Before I tell you the ways you can spend
50.032	it that will make you happier,
53.501	let's think about the ways
53.501	we usually spend it
55.708	that don't, in fact, make us happier.
57.544	We had a little natural experiment.
59.304	So CNN, a little while ago,
59.304	wrote this interesting article
62.111	on what happens to people
62.111	when they win the lottery.
64.627	It turns out people think
64.627	when they win the lottery
67.089	their lives will be amazing.
68.47	This article's about
68.47	how their lives get ruined.
70.804	What happens when people win the lottery
72.749	is, one, they spend
72.749	all the money and go into debt;
75.171	and two, all of their friends
75.171	and everyone they've ever met
78.263	find them and bug them for money.
80.032	It ruins their social
80.032	relationships, in fact.
82.228	So they have more debt
82.228	and worse friendships
84.336	than they had before they won the lottery.
86.387	What was interesting
86.387	about the article was,
88.431	people started commenting
88.431	on the article, readers of the thing.
91.447	And instead of talking
91.447	about how it made them realize
93.983	that money doesn't lead to happiness,
95.805	"everyone started saying, ""You know"
95.805	"what I'd do if I won the lottery ...?"""
99.273	and fantasizing about what they'd do.
101.096	Here's just two of the ones we saw
101.096	that are interesting to think about.
104.49	"One person wrote, ""When I win,"
104.49	I'm going to buy my own little mountain
107.85	"and have a little house on top."""
109.442	(Laughter)
110.781	And another person wrote,
110.781	"""I would fill a big bathtub with money"
113.854	and get in the tub
113.854	while smoking a big fat cigar
116.118	"and sipping a glass of champagne."""
117.988	This is even worse:
117.988	"""... then I'd have a picture taken"
120.572	and dozens of glossies made.
121.94	Anyone begging for money
121.94	or trying to extort from me
124.46	would receive a copy
124.46	"of the picture and nothing else."""
127.235	(Laughter)
129.704	And so many of the comments
129.704	were exactly of this type,
132.301	where people got money
132.301	and, in fact, it made them antisocial.
135.593	So I told you it ruins people's lives
135.593	and their friends bug them.
138.805	Also, money often makes
138.805	us feel very selfish
141.021	and we do things only for ourselves.
142.86	We thought maybe the reason money
142.86	doesn't make us happy
145.5	is that we're spending it
145.5	on the wrong things;
147.696	in particular, we're always
147.696	spending it on ourselves.
150.246	And we wondered what would happen
151.857	if we made people spend
151.857	more of their money on others.
154.421	So instead of being antisocial
154.421	with your money,
156.668	what if you were more pro-social with it?
158.695	We thought, let's make people
158.695	do it and see what happens.
161.563	Let's have some people
161.563	do what they usually do,
163.789	spend money on themselves,
165.091	and let's make some people
165.091	give money away,
167.146	and measure their happiness
167.146	and see if, in fact, they get happier.
170.284	The first way we did this was,
170.284	one Vancouver morning,
172.861	we went out on the campus
172.861	at University of British Columbia,
175.86	approached people and said,
175.86	"""Do you want to be in an experiment?"""
178.948	"They said, ""Yes."""
180.14	We asked them how happy they were,
180.14	and then gave them an envelope.
183.265	One of the envelopes
183.265	had things in it that said,
185.603	"""By 5pm today,"
185.603	"spend this money on yourself."""
188.622	We gave some examples
188.622	of what you could spend it on.
191.219	Other people got
191.219	a slip of paper that said,
193.308	"""By 5pm today, spend this money"
193.308	"on somebody else."""
196.447	Also inside the envelope was money.
198.661	And we manipulated
198.661	how much money we gave them;
200.896	some people got this slip
200.896	of paper and five dollars,
203.547	some got this slip
203.547	of paper and 20 dollars.
206.183	We let them go about their day
206.183	and do whatever they wanted.
209.214	We found out they did spend it
209.214	in the way we asked them to.
212.215	We called them up and asked them,
212.215	"""What did you spend it on?"
215.156	"How happy do you feel now?"""
216.496	What did they spend it on?
217.771	These are college undergrads;
219.192	a lot of what they spent it on
219.192	for themselves
221.331	were things like earrings and makeup.
223.151	One woman said she bought
223.151	a stuffed animal for her niece.
225.854	People gave money to homeless people.
227.657	Huge effect here of Starbucks.
229.724	(Laughter)
231.472	So if you give
231.472	undergraduates five dollars,
233.512	it looks like coffee to them,
234.934	and they run over to Starbucks
234.934	and spend it as fast as they can.
238.006	Some people bought coffee for themselves,
238.006	the way they usually would,
241.34	but others bought coffee
241.34	for somebody else.
243.483	So the very same purchase,
245.183	just targeted toward yourself
245.183	or targeted toward somebody else.
248.521	What did we find when we called
248.521	at the end of the day?
251.108	People who spent money
251.108	on others got happier;
253.267	people who spent it on themselves,
253.267	nothing happened.
255.781	It didn't make them less happy,
255.781	it just didn't do much for them.
258.833	The other thing we saw is the amount
258.833	of money doesn't matter much.
261.96	People thought 20 dollars
261.96	would be way better than five.
264.629	In fact, it doesn't matter
264.629	how much money you spent.
267.11	What really matters
267.11	is that you spent it on somebody else
269.83	rather than on yourself.
271.025	We see this again and again
272.355	when we give people money to spend
272.355	on others instead of on themselves.
275.737	Of course, these are
275.737	undergraduates in Canada --
278.027	not the world's most
278.027	representative population.
280.266	They're also fairly wealthy and affluent
280.266	and other sorts of things.
283.444	We wanted to see if this holds true
283.444	everywhere in the world
286.234	or just among wealthy countries.
287.803	So we went to Uganda
287.803	and ran a very similar experiment.
290.633	Imagine, instead of just people
290.633	in Canada, we say,
293.01	"""Name the last time you spent"
293.01	money on yourself or others.
295.792	"Describe it. How happy did it make you?"""
297.733	"Or in Uganda, ""Name the last time"
297.733	you spent money on yourself or others
301.175	"and describe that."""
302.356	Then we asked them
302.356	how happy they are, again.
304.541	And what we see is sort of amazing,
306.245	because there's human universals
306.245	on what you do with your money,
309.314	and real cultural differences
309.314	on what you do as well.
311.825	So for example, one guy
311.825	from Uganda says this:
315.153	"""I called a girl I wished to love."""
317.053	They basically went out on a date,
318.86	and he says at the end
318.86	"that he didn't ""achieve"" her up till now."
322.136	(Laughter)
323.324	Here's a guy from Canada.
325.319	Very similar thing.
327.05	"""I took my girlfriend out for dinner."
329.065	We went to a movie, we left early,
330.93	and then went back to her room
330.93	"for ... cake,"" just cake."
334.753	(Laughter)
336.131	Human universal:
337.308	you spend money on others,
337.308	you're being nice.
339.568	Maybe you have something
339.568	in mind, maybe not.
341.657	But then we see extraordinary differences.
343.733	So look at these two.
344.91	This is a woman from Canada.
346.288	"We say, ""Name a time you spent"
346.288	"money on somebody else."""
348.888	"She says, ""I bought a present for my mom."
350.889	I drove to the mall, bought
350.889	"a present, gave it to my mom."""
353.639	Perfectly nice thing to do.
354.966	It's good to get gifts
354.966	for people you know.
357.045	Compare that to this woman from Uganda:
359.401	"""I was walking and met a longtime friend"
359.401	whose son was sick with malaria.
363.119	They had no money, they went to a clinic
363.119	"and I gave her this money."""
366.517	This isn't $10,000,
366.517	it's the local currency.
368.75	So it's a very small
368.75	amount of money, in fact.
370.966	But enormously different motivations here.
373.099	This is a real medical need,
373.099	literally a lifesaving donation.
376.651	Above, it's just kind of,
376.651	I bought a gift for my mother.
379.423	What we see again, though,
381.058	is that the specific way you spend
381.058	on other people isn't nearly as important
384.732	as the fact that you spend on other people
384.732	in order to make yourself happy,
388.706	which is really quite important.
390.289	So you don't have to do
390.289	amazing things with your money
392.854	to make yourself happy.
394.029	You can do small, trivial things and still
394.029	get the benefits from doing this.
397.656	These are only two countries.
399.089	We wanted to look at every country
399.089	in the world if we could,
402.062	to see what the relationship is
402.062	between money and happiness.
404.985	We got data from the Gallup Organization,
406.993	which you know from
406.993	all the political polls happening lately.
409.892	"They asked people, ""Did you donate"
409.892	"money to charity recently?"""
412.849	"and, ""How happy are you"
412.849	"with life in general?"""
415.046	We can see what the relationship is
415.046	between those two things.
417.947	Are they positively correlated,
417.947	giving money makes you happy?
420.883	Or are they negatively correlated?
422.547	On this map, green will mean
422.547	they're positively correlated,
425.366	red means they're negatively correlated.
427.31	And you can see,
427.31	the world is crazily green.
429.431	So in almost every country in the world
429.431	where we have this data,
432.718	people who give money
432.718	to charity are happier people
435.199	than people who don't give
435.199	money to charity.
437.353	I know you're looking
437.353	at the red country in the middle.
439.991	I would be a jerk and not
439.991	tell you what it is,
442.169	but it's Central African Republic.
443.828	You can make up stories.
445.004	Maybe it's different there
445.004	for some reason.
447.04	Just below that to the right
447.04	is Rwanda, though,
449.278	which is amazingly green.
450.516	So almost everywhere we look,
451.926	we see that giving money away
451.926	makes you happier
454.383	than keeping it for yourself.
455.953	What about work, which is where
455.953	we spend the rest of our time,
458.942	when we're not with the people we know.
460.828	We decided to infiltrate some companies
460.828	and do a very similar thing.
464.075	These are sales teams in Belgium.
465.904	They work in teams,
465.904	go out and sell to doctors
468.977	and try to get them to buy drugs.
470.577	We can look and see
470.577	how well they sell things
472.747	as a function of being a member of a team.
475.014	We give people on some teams some money
477.644	"""Spend it however you want on yourself,"""
479.632	just like we did
479.632	with the undergrads in Canada.
481.906	"To other teams we say, ""Here's 15 euro."
481.906	Spend it on one of your teammates.
485.6	Buy them something as a gift
485.6	and give it to them.
488.288	Then we can see, we've got teams
488.288	that spend on themselves
491.012	and these pro-social teams
491.012	who we give money to make the team better.
494.807	The reason I have
494.807	a ridiculous pinata there
496.86	is one team pooled their money
496.86	and bought a pinata,
499.299	they smashed the pinata,
499.299	the candy fell out and things like that.
502.404	A silly, trivial thing to do,
503.868	but think of the difference on a team
503.868	that didn't do that at all,
507.197	that got 15 euro, put it in their pocket,
507.197	maybe bought themselves a coffee,
510.795	or teams that had
510.795	this pro-social experience
512.879	where they bonded together
512.879	to buy something and do a group activity.
516.194	What we see is that the teams
516.194	that are pro-social sell more stuff
519.287	than the teams that only got
519.287	money for themselves.
521.706	One way to think of it is: for every
525.373	they put it in their pocket and don't do
525.373	anything different than before.
528.805	You don't get money from that;
530.27	you lose money, since it doesn't
530.27	motivate them to perform better.
533.373	But when you give them 15 euro
533.373	to spend on their teammates,
536.199	they do so much better on their teams
537.997	that you actually get a huge win
537.997	on investing this kind of money.
541.115	You're probably thinking
541.115	to yourselves, this is all fine,
543.821	but there's a context that's incredibly
543.821	important for public policy,
547.048	and I can't imagine it would work there.
548.986	And if he doesn't show me
548.986	that it works here,
551.117	I don't believe anything he said.
552.755	I know what you're all thinking
552.755	about are dodgeball teams.
555.566	(Laughter)
556.981	This was a huge criticism that we got,
558.86	that if you can't show it
558.86	with dodgeball teams, this is all stupid.
562.065	So we went and found these dodgeball
562.065	teams and infiltrated them,
566.272	and did the exact same thing as before.
568.174	So we give people on some teams
568.174	money to spend on themselves.
571.118	Other teams, we give them money
571.118	to spend on their dodgeball teammates.
574.86	The teams that spend money on themselves
576.86	have the same winning
576.86	percentages as before.
579.07	The teams we give the money
579.07	to spend on each other
581.513	become different teams;
582.692	they dominate the league
582.692	by the time they're done.
585.267	Across all of these different contexts --
587.3	your personal life, you work life,
587.3	even things like intramural sports --
590.932	we see spending on other people
590.932	has a bigger return for you
593.766	than spending on yourself.
595.764	So if you think money can't buy happiness,
595.764	you're not spending it right.
599.589	The implication isn't you should buy
599.589	this product instead of that product,
603.193	and that's the way
603.193	to make yourself happier.
605.347	It's that you should stop thinking
605.347	about which product to buy for yourself,
609.006	and try giving some of it
609.006	to other people instead.
611.86	And we luckily have
611.86	an opportunity for you.
614.388	DonorsChoose.org is a nonprofit
614.388	for mainly public school teachers
618.482	in low-income schools.
619.939	They post projects like,
621.256	"""I want to teach Huckleberry Finn"
621.256	"and we don't have the books,"""
624.3	"or, ""I want a microscope"
624.3	to teach my students science
626.81	"and we don't have a microscope."""
628.363	You and I can go on and buy it for them.
630.338	The teacher and the kids
630.338	write you thank-you notes,
632.837	sometimes they send pictures
632.837	of them using the microscope.
635.674	It's an extraordinary thing.
637.044	Go to the website and start yourself
637.044	on the process of thinking
640.184	"less about ""How can I spend"
640.184	"money on myself?"""
642.312	"and more about ""If I've got"
642.312	five dollars or 15 dollars,
645.193	"what can I do to benefit other people?"""
647.362	Ultimately, when you do that, you'll find
647.362	you benefit yourself much more.
650.872	Thank you.
652.087	(Applause)
