12.16	Now, if President Obama
15.16	invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics,
19.16	then I would have a suggestion for him
22.16	that I think would vastly improve
24.16	the mathematics education in this country.
27.16	And it would be easy to implement
29.16	and inexpensive.
31.16	The mathematics curriculum that we have
33.16	is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra.
37.16	And everything we learn after that
39.16	is building up towards one subject.
42.16	And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus.
46.16	And I'm here to say
48.16	that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ...
52.16	that the correct summit -- that all of our students,
54.16	every high school graduate should know --
56.16	should be statistics:
59.16	probability and statistics.
61.16	(Applause)
63.16	I mean, don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject.
67.16	It's one of the great products of the human mind.
69.16	The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus.
73.16	And every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics,
77.16	they should definitely learn calculus
79.16	by the end of their freshman year of college.
81.16	But I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics,
84.16	that very few people actually use calculus
88.16	in a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives.
91.16	On the other hand,
93.16	statistics -- that's a subject that you could,
96.16	and should, use on daily basis. Right?
99.16	It's risk. It's reward. It's randomness.
102.16	It's understanding data.
104.16	I think if our students, if our high school students --
106.16	if all of the American citizens --
108.16	knew about probability and statistics,
111.16	we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today. (Laughter) (Applause)
114.16	Not only -- thank you -- not only that ...
117.16	but if it's taught properly, it can be a lot of fun.
120.16	I mean, probability and statistics,
122.16	it's the mathematics of games and gambling.
126.16	It's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future.
130.16	Look, the world has changed
132.16	from analog to digital.
135.16	And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change
138.16	from analog to digital,
140.16	from the more classical, continuous mathematics,
144.16	to the more modern, discrete mathematics --
147.16	the mathematics of uncertainty,
149.16	of randomness, of data --
151.16	that being probability and statistics.
154.16	In summary, instead of our students
156.16	learning about the techniques of calculus,
159.16	I think it would be far more significant
162.16	if all of them knew what two standard deviations
165.16	from the mean means. And I mean it.
168.16	Thank you very much.
170.16	(Applause)
