16.2	Sadly,
18.2	in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat,
21.487	four Americans that are alive
24.2	will be dead through
24.2	the food that they eat.
29.891	My name's Jamie Oliver.
31.29	I'm 34 years old.
33.041	I'm from Essex in England
35.2	and for the last seven years
38.2	I've worked fairly tirelessly
38.2	to save lives in my own way.
44.384	I'm not a doctor;
46.2	I'm a chef,
47.401	I don't have expensive equipment
49.947	or medicine.
51.041	I use information, education.
54.525	I profoundly believe
54.525	that the power of food
57.526	has a primal place in our homes
60.725	that binds us to the best bits of life.
67.12	We have an awful, awful reality right now.
73.779	America, you're at the top of your game.
77.2	This is one of the most unhealthy
77.2	countries in the world.
80.89	Can I please just see a raise of hands
83.56	for how many of you have
83.56	children in this room today?
86.163	Put your hands up.
87.588	You can continue to put your hands up,
87.588	aunties and uncles as well.
91.532	Most of you. OK.
93.533	We, the adults of the last
93.533	four generations,
96.534	have blessed our children with the destiny
99.423	of a shorter lifespan
99.423	than their own parents.
105.279	Your child will live a life
105.279	ten years younger than you
110.2	because of the landscape of food
110.2	that we've built around them.
114.595	Two-thirds of this room,
116.104	today, in America, are statistically
116.104	overweight or obese.
119.434	You lot, you're all right,
120.705	but we'll get you eventually, don't worry.
122.744	(Laughter)
124.2	The statistics of bad health are clear,
127.2	very clear.
129.009	We spend our lives being paranoid
129.009	about death, murder, homicide,
132.657	you name it; it's on the front page
132.657	of every paper, CNN.
136.2	Look at homicide
136.2	at the bottom, for God's sake.
139.598	Right?
140.653	(Laughter)
142.2	(Applause)
147.2	Every single one of those in the red
147.2	is a diet-related disease.
151.54	Any doctor, any specialist
151.54	will tell you that.
154.152	Fact: diet-related disease
154.152	is the biggest killer
157.463	in the United States,
157.463	right now, here today.
163.305	This is a global problem.
165.77	It's a catastrophe.
166.946	It's sweeping the world.
168.438	England is right behind you, as usual.
171.413	(Laughter)
175.644	I know they were close,
175.644	but not that close.
178.366	We need a revolution.
179.738	Mexico, Australia, Germany,
182.041	India, China,
183.293	all have massive problems
183.293	of obesity and bad health.
187.985	Think about smoking.
190.294	It costs way less than obesity now.
192.937	Obesity costs you Americans
202.274	In 10 years, it's set to double:
205.717	Let's be honest, guys,
205.717	you haven't got that cash.
208.117	(Laughter)
212.025	I came here to start a food revolution
212.025	that I so profoundly believe in.
218.44	We need it. The time is now.
220.719	We're in a tipping-point moment.
222.47	I've been doing this for seven years.
224.279	I've been trying in America
224.279	for seven years.
226.466	Now is the time when it's ripe --
226.466	ripe for the picking.
230.374	I went to the eye of the storm.
232.2	I went to West Virginia,
232.2	the most unhealthy state in America.
235.153	Or it was last year.
236.216	We've got a new one this year,
236.216	but we'll work on that next season.
239.479	(Laughter)
241.386	Huntington, West Virginia. Beautiful town.
243.433	I wanted to put heart and soul and people,
246.954	your public,
248.733	around the statistics
248.733	that we've become so used to.
252.604	I want to introduce you
252.604	to some of the people that I care about:
255.628	your public, your children.
257.272	I want to show a picture
257.272	of my friend Brittany.
259.845	She's 16 years old.
262.128	She's got six years to live
265.642	because of the food that she's eaten.
268.484	She's the third generation of Americans
270.612	that hasn't grown up
270.612	within a food environment
272.827	where they've been taught
272.827	to cook at home or in school,
275.44	or her mom, or her mom's mom.
277.471	She has six years to live.
280.787	She's eating her liver to death.
283.66	Stacy, the Edwards family.
285.613	This is a normal family, guys.
288.2	Stacy does her best,
288.2	but she's third-generation as well;
291.05	she was never taught to cook
291.05	at home or at school.
293.423	The family's obese.
294.582	Justin here, 12 years old,
294.582	he's 350 pounds.
297.327	He gets bullied, for God's sake.
299.019	The daughter there, Katie,
299.019	she's four years old.
301.51	She's obese before she even gets
301.51	to primary school.
304.534	Marissa, she's all right,
304.534	she's one of your lot.
307.482	But you know what?
308.529	Her father, who was obese,
308.529	died in her arms,
311.911	And then the second
311.911	most important man in her life,
314.339	her uncle, died of obesity,
316.887	and now her step-dad is obese.
319.977	You see, the thing is,
321.777	obesity and diet-related disease
324.2	doesn't just hurt the people that have it;
326.224	it's all of their friends, families,
326.224	brothers, sisters.
330.413	Pastor Steve:
332.2	an inspirational man,
333.661	one of my early allies
333.661	in Huntington, West Virginia.
336.531	He's at the sharp knife-edge
336.531	of this problem.
340.475	He has to bury the people, OK?
342.832	And he's fed up with it.
344.036	He's fed up with burying his friends,
344.036	his family, his community.
347.387	Come winter, three times
347.387	as many people die.
350.716	He's sick of it.
352.2	This is preventable disease.
352.2	Waste of life.
355.2	By the way, this is
355.2	what they get buried in.
358.525	We're not geared up to do this.
361.303	Can't even get them out the door,
361.303	and I'm being serious.
363.955	Can't even get them there. Forklift.
366.732	OK, I see it as a triangle, OK?
368.848	This is our landscape of food.
370.404	I need you to understand it.
371.785	You've probably heard all this before.
373.873	Over the last 30 years,
375.183	what's happened that's ripped
375.183	the heart out of this country?
378.04	Let's be frank and honest.
380.724	Well, modern-day life.
382.948	Let's start with the Main Street.
385.327	Fast food has taken over
385.327	the whole country; we know that.
388.035	The big brands are
388.035	some of the most important powers,
390.863	powerful powers, in this country.
393.313	(Sighs)
394.338	Supermarkets as well.
396.08	Big companies. Big companies.
398.471	Thirty years ago, most of the food
401.455	was largely local and largely fresh.
404.2	Now it's largely processed
404.2	and full of all sorts of additives,
407.583	extra ingredients,
407.583	and you know the rest of the story.
410.298	Portion size is obviously
410.298	a massive, massive problem.
414.877	Labeling is a massive problem.
417.533	The labeling in this country
417.533	is a disgrace.
420.69	The industry wants
420.69	to self-police themselves.
426.2	What, in this kind of climate?
426.2	They don't deserve it.
428.779	How can you say something is low-fat
428.779	when it's full of so much sugar?
433.271	Home.
436.473	The biggest problem with the home
438.072	is that used to be the heart
438.072	of passing on food culture,
443.2	what made our society.
445.648	That is not happening anymore.
447.105	And you know, as we go
447.105	to work and as life changes,
450.01	and as life always evolves,
452.011	we kind of have
452.011	to look at it holistically --
454.148	step back for a moment,
454.148	and re-address the balance.
456.56	It hasn't happened for 30 years, OK?
459.604	I want to show you a situation
462.986	that is very normal right now;
462.986	the Edwards family.
466.842	(Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk.
469.672	This stuff goes through you
469.672	and your family's body every week.
473.729	And I need you to know
475.662	that this is going to kill
475.662	your children early.
479.81	How are you feeling?
481.899	Stacy: Just feeling really sad
481.899	and depressed right now.
485.89	But, you know, I want
485.89	my kids to succeed in life
489.027	and this isn't going to get them there.
492.009	But I'm killing them.
494.915	JO: Yes you are. You are.
497.915	But we can stop that.
503.017	Normal.
505.266	Let's get on schools,
507.124	something that I'm fairly much
507.124	a specialist in.
510.2	OK, school.
512.2	What is school? Who invented it?
512.2	What's the purpose of school?
515.2	School was always invented
515.2	to arm us with the tools
518.056	to make us creative, do wonderful things,
520.899	make us earn a living, etc., etc.
523.38	You know, it's been kind of in this sort
523.38	of tight box for a long, long time, OK?
528.2	But we haven't really evolved it
530.2	to deal with the health
530.2	catastrophes of America, OK?
533.554	School food is something
536.665	that most kids --
539.347	have twice a day, more than often,
539.347	breakfast and lunch,
545.785	So you could say that school
545.785	food is quite important, really,
548.984	judging the circumstances.
550.594	(Laughter)
555.659	Before I crack into my rant,
558.2	which I'm sure you're waiting for --
560.25	(Laughter)
563.321	I need to say one thing,
563.321	and it's so important
565.711	in, hopefully, the magic
565.711	that happens and unfolds
568.442	in the next three months.
570.2	The lunch ladies,
570.2	the lunch cooks of America --
573.513	I offer myself as their ambassador.
576.912	I'm not slagging them off.
578.422	They're doing the best they can do.
583.088	They're doing their best.
585.2	But they're doing what they're told,
587.056	and what they're being
587.056	told to do is wrong.
589.636	The system is highly run by accountants;
592.897	there's not enough, or any,
592.897	food-knowledgeable people in the business.
596.998	There's a problem:
598.053	If you're not a food expert,
598.053	and you've got tight budgets
601.2	and it's getting tighter,
601.2	then you can't be creative,
603.934	you can't duck and dive
603.934	and write different things around things.
607.097	If you're an accountant, and a box-ticker,
609.128	the only thing you can do
609.128	in these circumstances
611.398	is buy cheaper shit.
612.45	Now, the reality is,
613.804	the food that your kids get
613.804	every day is fast food,
617.439	it's highly processed,
618.772	there's not enough
618.772	fresh food in there at all.
621.036	You know, the amount
621.036	of additives, E numbers,
623.241	ingredients you wouldn't believe --
624.971	there's not enough veggies at all.
626.706	French fries are considered a vegetable.
628.654	Pizza for breakfast.
628.654	They don't even get crockery.
631.2	Knives and forks?
631.2	No, they're too dangerous.
634.357	They have scissors in the classroom,
636.121	but knives and forks? No.
637.526	And the way I look at it is:
638.946	If you don't have knives
638.946	and forks in your school,
641.359	you're purely endorsing,
642.922	from a state level, fast food,
642.922	because it's handheld.
646.018	And yes, by the way, it is fast food:
647.827	It's sloppy Joes, it's burgers,
649.441	it's wieners, it's pizzas,
649.441	it's all of that stuff.
653.465	(Sighs)
655.652	Ten percent of what we spend
655.652	on health care, as I said earlier,
658.653	is on obesity, and it's going to double.
662.35	We're not teaching our kids.
663.804	There's no statutory right
663.804	to teach kids about food,
666.533	elementary or secondary school, OK?
668.35	We don't teach kids about food, right?
670.692	And this is a little clip
670.692	from an elementary school,
673.145	which is very common in England.
677.2	(Video) Who knows what this is?
678.753	Child: Potatoes.
679.848	Jamie Oliver: Potato?
679.848	So, you think these are potatoes?
682.46	Do you know what that is?
683.994	Do you know what that is?
685.222	Child: Broccoli?
686.261	JO: What about this? Our good old friend.
688.741	Child: Celery.
689.925	JO: No. What do you think this is?
691.893	Child: Onion.
691.893	JO: Onion? No.
693.401	JO: Immediately you
693.401	get a really clear sense
695.831	"of ""Do the kids know anything"
695.831	"about where food comes from?"""
699.075	Who knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear?
701.076	JO: What do you think this is?
701.076	Child: I don't know.
703.528	JO: If the kids don't know what stuff is,
705.536	then they will never eat it.
709.123	(Laughter)
710.404	JO: Normal. England and America,
713.2	England and America.
714.762	Guess what fixed that.
717.367	Two one-hour sessions.
720.411	We've got to start teaching our kids
720.411	about food in schools, period.
724.636	(Applause)
730.2	I want to tell you about something
734.245	that kind of epitomizes the trouble
734.245	that we're in, guys, OK?
738.607	I want to talk about something
738.607	so basic as milk.
741.842	Every kid has the right to milk at school.
743.867	Your kids will be having milk
743.867	at school, breakfast and lunch, right?
747.487	They'll be having two bottles, OK?
749.309	And most kids do.
750.826	But milk ain't good enough anymore.
753.635	Don't get me wrong, I support milk --
756.2	but someone at the milk board
758.34	probably paid a lot of money
758.34	for some geezer to work out
761.034	that if you put loads of flavorings,
762.799	colorings and sugar in milk,
764.246	more kids will drink it.
766.905	Yeah.
768.421	Obviously now that's going to catch on
770.398	the apple board is going to work out
772.208	that if they make toffee apples
772.208	they'll eat more as well.
775.009	Do you know what I mean?
776.446	For me, there isn't any need
776.446	to flavor the milk.
779.517	Okay? There's sugar in everything.
781.564	I know the ins and outs
781.564	of those ingredients.
783.737	It's in everything.
784.787	Even the milk hasn't escaped
784.787	the kind of modern-day problems.
788.389	There's our milk. There's our carton.
790.2	In that is nearly as much sugar
790.2	as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop,
794.473	and they are having two a day.
795.933	So, let me just show you.
797.512	We've got one kid, here --
802.287	having, you know,
802.287	eight tablespoons of sugar a day.
806.819	You know, there's your week.
809.7	There's your month.
812.778	And I've taken the liberty of putting in
814.997	just the five years
814.997	of elementary school sugar,
821.653	just from milk.
826.2	Now, I don't know about you guys,
828.044	but judging the circumstances, right,
830.885	any judge in the whole world,
833.2	would look at the statistics
833.2	and the evidence,
835.688	and they would find any government
835.688	of old guilty of child abuse.
839.528	That's my belief.
840.656	(Applause)
847.547	(Applause ends)
849.2	Now, if I came up here, and I wish
849.2	I could come up here today
852.516	and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer,
855.201	you'd be fighting
855.201	and scrambling to get to me.
858.684	This, all this bad news, is preventable.
862.2	That's the good news.
863.735	It's very, very preventable.
866.48	So, let's just think about,
866.48	we got a problem here,
869.2	we need to reboot.
871.533	Okay so, in my world,
871.533	what do we need to do?
874.2	Here is the thing, right,
875.939	it cannot just come from one source.
878.2	To reboot and make real tangible change,
881.631	real change, so that I could look you
881.631	in the white of the eyes
884.599	"and say, ""In 10 years' time,"
886.2	the history of your children's lives,
888.2	happiness -- and let's not forget,
888.2	you're clever if you eat well,
891.272	you know you're going to live longer --
893.154	all of that stuff,
893.154	"it will look different. OK?"""
896.806	So, supermarkets.
898.536	Where else do you shop so religiously?
900.48	Week in, week out.
901.692	How much money do you spend,
901.692	in your life, in a supermarket?
904.795	Love them.
905.827	They just sell us what we want. All right.
907.907	They owe us to put a food ambassador
907.907	in every major supermarket.
912.882	They need to help us shop.
914.486	They need to show us how to cook
914.486	quick, tasty, seasonal meals
918.2	for people that are busy.
920.089	This is not expensive.
922.082	It is done in some, and it needs
922.082	to be done across the board
924.987	in America soon, and quick.
927.064	The big brands, you know, the food brands,
930.065	need to put food education
930.065	at the heart of their businesses.
933.814	I know, easier said than done.
935.718	It's the future. It's the only way.
937.953	Fast food.
939.598	With the fast-food industry
942.382	you know, it's very competitive.
944.2	I've had loads
944.2	of secret papers and dealings
946.319	with fast food restaurants.
948.061	I know how they do it.
949.902	I mean, basically they've weaned us on
952.199	to these hits of sugar,
952.199	salt and fat, and x, y, and z,
955.002	and everyone loves them, right?
957.003	So, these guys are going
957.003	to be part of the solution.
960.223	But we need to get the government to work
962.2	with all of the fast food purveyors
962.2	and the restaurant industry,
965.272	and over a five, six, seven year period
967.345	wean of us off the extreme amounts
969.688	of fat, sugar and all the other
969.688	non-food ingredients.
973.2	Now, also, back to the sort of big brands:
975.506	labeling, I said earlier,
975.506	is an absolute farce
978.712	and has got to be sorted.
981.503	OK, school.
983.73	Obviously, in schools, we owe it to them
986.2	to make sure those 180 days of the year,
988.2	from that little precious age of four,
990.2	until 18, 20, 24, whatever,
992.2	they need to be cooked proper, fresh food
997.075	from local growers on site, OK?
999.2	There needs to be a new
999.2	standard of fresh, proper food
1001.75	for your children, yeah?
1003.2	(Applause)
1007.653	Under the circumstances,
1007.653	it's profoundly important
1011.113	that every single
1011.113	American child leaves school
1013.706	knowing how to cook 10 recipes
1015.707	that will save their life.
1018.2	Life skills.
1019.303	(Applause)
1021.524	That means that they can be
1021.524	students, young parents,
1024.586	and be able to sort of duck and dive
1024.586	around the basics of cooking,
1028.849	no matter what recession hits
1028.849	them next time.
1030.976	If you can cook,
1030.976	recession money doesn't matter.
1033.382	If you can cook, time doesn't matter.
1037.395	The workplace, we haven't
1037.395	really talked about it.
1039.864	You know, it's now time
1039.864	for corporate responsibility
1043.45	to really look at what they feed
1043.45	or make available to their staff.
1047.498	The staff are the moms and dads
1047.498	of America's children.
1050.832	Marissa, her father died in her hand,
1053.015	I think she'd be quite happy
1055.016	if corporate America could start
1055.016	feeding their staff properly.
1058.2	Definitely they shouldn't be left out.
1060.2	Let's go back to the home.
1061.79	Now, look, if we do
1061.79	all this stuff, and we can,
1064.054	it's so achievable.
1065.151	You can care and be commercial.
1066.917	Absolutely.
1067.964	But the home needs to start passing on
1067.964	cooking again, for sure.
1072.983	For sure, pass it on as a philosophy.
1075.473	And for me, it's quite romantic,
1077.141	but it's about if one person
1077.141	teaches three people
1079.558	how to cook something,
1081.2	and they teach three of their mates,
1082.964	that only has to repeat itself 25 times,
1085.312	and that's the whole
1085.312	population of America.
1087.591	Romantic, yes, but most importantly,
1091.915	it's about trying to get people to realize
1094.63	that every one of your individual efforts
1094.63	makes a difference.
1097.638	We've got to put back what's been lost.
1100.332	Huntington's Kitchen.
1102.195	Huntington, where I made this program,
1104.49	we've got this prime-time program
1106.101	that hopefully will inspire people
1106.101	to really get on this change.
1109.313	I truly believe that change will happen.
1111.368	Huntington's Kitchen.
1111.368	I work with a community.
1113.559	I worked in the schools.
1115.064	I found local sustainable funding
1117.353	to get every single school in the area
1117.353	from the junk, onto the fresh food:
1121.663	six-and-a-half grand per school.
1124.2	(Applause)
1125.43	That's all it takes,
1125.43	six-and-a-half grand per school.
1127.95	The Kitchen is 25 grand a month. Okay?
1130.377	This can do 5,000 people a year,
1133.276	which is 10 percent of their population,
1135.418	and it's people on people.
1136.823	You know, it's local cooks
1136.823	teaching local people.
1139.148	It's free cooking lessons,
1139.148	guys, in the Main Street.
1143.54	This is real, tangible change,
1143.54	real, tangible change.
1147.684	Around America, if we just look back now,
1150.73	there is plenty of wonderful
1150.73	things going on.
1153.834	There is plenty of beautiful
1153.834	things going on.
1155.967	There are angels
1155.967	around America doing great things
1159.2	in schools -- farm-to-school set-ups,
1162.121	garden set-ups, education --
1164.756	there are amazing people
1164.756	doing this already.
1166.877	The problem is they all want to roll out
1168.83	what they're doing to the next school,
1170.989	but there's no cash.
1173.257	We need to recognize the experts
1173.257	and the angels quickly,
1176.981	identify them, and allow them
1176.981	to easily find the resource
1180.2	to keep rolling out
1180.2	what they're already doing,
1182.464	and doing well.
1184.048	Businesses of America need to support
1186.344	Mrs. Obama to do the things
1186.344	that she wants to do.
1189.2	(Applause)
1195.623	And look, I know it's weird
1197.593	having an English person
1197.593	standing here before you
1200.2	talking about all this.
1201.665	All I can say is: I care.
1203.569	I'm a father,
1205.015	and I love this country.
1207.2	And I believe truly, actually,
1209.826	that if change can be made
1209.826	in this country,
1212.699	beautiful things will happen
1212.699	around the world.
1214.906	If America does it,
1214.906	other people will follow.
1217.065	It's incredibly important.
1218.837	(Audience) Yeah!
1219.929	(Applause)
1225.584	When I was in Huntington,
1226.886	trying to get a few things to work
1226.886	when they weren't,
1229.534	"I thought ""If I had a magic wand,"
1229.534	"what would I do?"""
1234.869	"And I thought, ""You know what?"
1236.45	I'd just love to be put in front
1236.45	of some of the most amazing
1239.757	"movers and shakers in America."""
1242.441	And a month later, TED phoned me up
1242.441	and gave me this award.
1246.993	I'm here.
1250.715	So, my wish.
1256.935	Dyslexic, so I'm a bit slow.
1264.2	My wish
1266.2	is for you to help a strong,
1266.2	sustainable movement
1270.355	to educate every child
1274.053	about food,
1276.465	to inspire families to cook again,
1280.004	and to empower people everywhere
1282.689	to fight obesity.
1285.2	(Applause)
1295.443	Thank you.
1296.52	(Applause continues)
