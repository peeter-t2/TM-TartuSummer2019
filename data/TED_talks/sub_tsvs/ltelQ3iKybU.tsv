15.772	I'd like to tell you about two games of chess.
18.328	The first happened in 1997, in which Garry Kasparov,
22.192	a human, lost to Deep Blue, a machine.
25.908	To many, this was the dawn of a new era,
28.148	one where man would be dominated by machine.
30.927	But here we are, 20 years on, and the greatest change
34.261	in how we relate to computers is the iPad,
36.951	not HAL.
38.996	The second game was a freestyle chess tournament
41.644	in 2005, in which man and machine could enter together
44.613	as partners, rather than adversaries, if they so chose.
49.279	At first, the results were predictable.
51.13	Even a supercomputer was beaten by a grandmaster
53.627	with a relatively weak laptop.
55.939	The surprise came at the end. Who won?
58.924	Not a grandmaster with a supercomputer,
61.7	but actually two American amateurs
63.193	using three relatively weak laptops.
67.015	Their ability to coach and manipulate their computers
69.611	to deeply explore specific positions
72.046	effectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge
74.436	of the grandmasters and the superior computational power
77.045	of other adversaries.
78.954	This is an astonishing result: average men,
81.859	average machines beating the best man, the best machine.
85.94	And anyways, isn't it supposed to be man versus machine?
89.139	Instead, it's about cooperation, and the right type of cooperation.
93.291	We've been paying a lot of attention to Marvin Minsky's
96.148	vision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years.
99.39	It's a sexy vision, for sure. Many have embraced it.
101.652	It's become the dominant school of thought in computer science.
104.405	But as we enter the era of big data, of network systems,
107.477	of open platforms, and embedded technology,
110.175	I'd like to suggest it's time to reevaluate an alternative vision
113.567	that was actually developed around the same time.
116.637	I'm talking about J.C.R. Licklider's human-computer symbiosis,
119.969	"perhaps better termed ""intelligence augmentation,"" I.A."
123.777	Licklider was a computer science titan who had a profound
126.417	effect on the development of technology and the Internet.
129.423	His vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate
132.291	in making decisions, controlling complex situations
135.881	without the inflexible dependence
137.651	on predetermined programs.
140.184	"Note that word ""cooperate."""
142.682	Licklider encourages us not to take a toaster
145.429	"and make it Data from ""Star Trek,"""
147.713	but to take a human and make her more capable.
151.248	Humans are so amazing -- how we think,
153.159	our non-linear approaches, our creativity,
155.777	iterative hypotheses, all very difficult if possible at all
157.908	for computers to do.
159.253	Licklider intuitively realized this, contemplating humans
161.705	setting the goals, formulating the hypotheses,
164.032	determining the criteria, and performing the evaluation.
167.408	Of course, in other ways, humans are so limited.
169.183	We're terrible at scale, computation and volume.
172.418	We require high-end talent management
174.254	to keep the rock band together and playing.
176.318	Licklider foresaw computers doing all the routinizable work
178.522	that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making.
181.798	Silently, without much fanfare,
184.022	this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess.
187.376	Protein folding, a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess —
190.732	there are more ways of folding a protein than there are atoms in the universe.
193.774	This is a world-changing problem with huge implications
196.127	for our ability to understand and treat disease.
198.435	And for this task, supercomputer field brute force simply isn't enough.
202.683	Foldit, a game created by computer scientists,
205.067	illustrates the value of the approach.
207.569	Non-technical, non-biologist amateurs play a video game
210.61	in which they visually rearrange the structure of the protein,
213.683	allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces
215.182	and interactions and identify structural issues.
218.139	This approach beat supercomputers 50 percent of the time
221.162	and tied 30 percent of the time.
223.746	Foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery
226.883	by deciphering the structure of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus.
230.043	A protease that had eluded determination for over 10 years
233.058	was solved was by three players in a matter of days,
235.684	perhaps the first major scientific advance
237.709	to come from playing a video game.
240.032	Last year, on the site of the Twin Towers,
242.213	the 9/11 memorial opened.
243.686	It displays the names of the thousands of victims
246.407	"using a beautiful concept called ""meaningful adjacency."""
249.47	It places the names next to each other based on their
251.636	relationships to one another: friends, families, coworkers.
253.849	When you put it all together, it's quite a computational
256.877	challenge: 3,500 victims, 1,800 adjacency requests,
261.1	the importance of the overall physical specifications
264.192	and the final aesthetics.
266.329	When first reported by the media, full credit for such a feat
268.944	was given to an algorithm from the New York City
270.836	design firm Local Projects. The truth is a bit more nuanced.
274.837	While an algorithm was used to develop the underlying framework,
277.708	humans used that framework to design the final result.
280.716	So in this case, a computer had evaluated millions
282.941	of possible layouts, managed a complex relational system,
286.276	and kept track of a very large set of measurements
288.69	and variables, allowing the humans to focus
291.1	on design and compositional choices.
293.902	So the more you look around you,
294.938	the more you see Licklider's vision everywhere.
296.9	Whether it's augmented reality in your iPhone or GPS in your car,
300.204	human-computer symbiosis is making us more capable.
303.174	So if you want to improve human-computer symbiosis,
304.829	what can you do?
306.258	You can start by designing the human into the process.
308.71	Instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem,
310.914	design the solution around what the human will do as well.
314.783	When you do this, you'll quickly realize that you spent
316.72	all of your time on the interface between man and machine,
319.599	specifically on designing away the friction in the interaction.
322.698	In fact, this friction is more important than the power
325.464	of the man or the power of the machine
327.516	in determining overall capability.
329.447	That's why two amateurs with a few laptops
331.424	handily beat a supercomputer and a grandmaster.
333.88	What Kasparov calls process is a byproduct of friction.
336.885	The better the process, the less the friction.
339.286	And minimizing friction turns out to be the decisive variable.
343.542	Or take another example: big data.
345.785	Every interaction we have in the world is recorded
347.691	by an ever growing array of sensors: your phone,
350.75	your credit card, your computer. The result is big data,
353.123	and it actually presents us with an opportunity
354.865	to more deeply understand the human condition.
357.527	The major emphasis of most approaches to big data
359.832	"focus on, ""How do I store this data? How do I search"
362.047	"this data? How do I process this data?"""
364.323	These are necessary but insufficient questions.
366.527	The imperative is not to figure out how to compute,
368.998	but what to compute. How do you impose human intuition
371.182	on data at this scale?
372.973	Again, we start by designing the human into the process.
376.472	When PayPal was first starting as a business, their biggest
379.284	"challenge was not, ""How do I send money back and forth online?"""
382.088	"It was, ""How do I do that without being defrauded by organized crime?"""
385.96	Why so challenging? Because while computers can learn
388.048	to detect and identify fraud based on patterns,
391.192	they can't learn to do that based on patterns
392.671	they've never seen before, and organized crime
394.787	has a lot in common with this audience: brilliant people,
397.496	relentlessly resourceful, entrepreneurial spirit — (Laughter) —
401.136	and one huge and important difference: purpose.
403.848	And so while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest
406.68	fraudsters, catching the cleverest is the difference
408.933	between success and failure.
411.478	There's a whole class of problems like this, ones with
413.699	adaptive adversaries. They rarely if ever present with a
416.274	repeatable pattern that's discernable to computers.
419.01	Instead, there's some inherent component of innovation or disruption,
423.003	and increasingly these problems are buried in big data.
425.738	For example, terrorism. Terrorists are always adapting
428.238	in minor and major ways to new circumstances, and despite
430.29	what you might see on TV, these adaptations,
433.384	and the detection of them, are fundamentally human.
435.677	Computers don't detect novel patterns and new behaviors,
438.794	but humans do. Humans, using technology, testing hypotheses,
442.029	searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them.
446.649	Osama bin Laden was not caught by artificial intelligence.
448.969	He was caught by dedicated, resourceful, brilliant people
451.522	in partnerships with various technologies.
455.791	As appealing as it might sound, you cannot algorithmically
458.609	data mine your way to the answer.
460.21	"There is no ""Find Terrorist"" button, and the more data"
463.065	we integrate from a vast variety of sources
465.367	across a wide variety of data formats from very
467.5	disparate systems, the less effective data mining can be.
470.809	Instead, people will have to look at data
472.833	and search for insight, and as Licklider foresaw long ago,
476.289	the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation,
478.974	and as Kasparov realized,
480.498	that means minimizing friction at the interface.
483.529	Now this approach makes possible things like combing
486.287	through all available data from very different sources,
489.673	identifying key relationships and putting them in one place,
492.465	something that's been nearly impossible to do before.
495.393	To some, this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties
497.335	implications. To others it foretells of an era of greater
500.745	privacy and civil liberties protections,
502.654	but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance.
505.59	That must be acknowledged, and they can't be swept aside,
507.783	even with the best of intents.
510.313	So let's explore, through a couple of examples, the impact
512.831	that technologies built to drive human-computer symbiosis
515.237	have had in recent time.
518.156	In October, 2007, U.S. and coalition forces raided
521.572	an al Qaeda safe house in the city of Sinjar
523.988	on the Syrian border of Iraq.
525.922	They found a treasure trove of documents:
530.633	These foreign fighters had left their families in the Gulf,
533.217	the Levant and North Africa to join al Qaeda in Iraq.
536.363	These records were human resource forms.
537.979	The foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization.
540.834	It turns out that al Qaeda, too,
542.045	is not without its bureaucracy. (Laughter)
544.642	"They answered questions like, ""Who recruited you?"""
546.74	"""What's your hometown?"" ""What occupation do you seek?"""
549.594	In that last question, a surprising insight was revealed.
552.763	The vast majority of foreign fighters
555.163	were seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom --
557.563	hugely important, since between 2003 and 2007, Iraq
561.901	had 1,382 suicide bombings, a major source of instability.
566.145	Analyzing this data was hard. The originals were sheets
568.203	of paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated.
570.945	The friction in the process did not allow for meaningful
573.137	results in an operational time frame using humans, PDFs
576.487	and tenacity alone.
578.705	The researchers had to lever up their human minds
580.658	with technology to dive deeper, to explore non-obvious
583.003	hypotheses, and in fact, insights emerged.
586.221	Twenty percent of the foreign fighters were from Libya,
591.833	hugely important since prior statistics put that figure at
594.283	three percent. It also helped to hone in on a figure
596.666	of rising importance in al Qaeda, Abu Yahya al-Libi,
599.643	a senior cleric in the Libyan Islamic fighting group.
602.274	In March of 2007, he gave a speech, after which there was
604.938	a surge in participation amongst Libyan foreign fighters.
608.404	Perhaps most clever of all, though, and least obvious,
611.51	by flipping the data on its head, the researchers were
613.583	able to deeply explore the coordination networks in Syria
616.483	that were ultimately responsible for receiving and
619	transporting the foreign fighters to the border.
621.464	These were networks of mercenaries, not ideologues,
624.097	who were in the coordination business for profit.
626.495	For example, they charged Saudi foreign fighters
628.399	substantially more than Libyans, money that would have
630.598	otherwise gone to al Qaeda.
632.918	Perhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network
634.963	if they knew they cheating would-be jihadists.
637.998	In January, 2010, a devastating 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti,
641.743	third deadliest earthquake of all time, left one million people,
647.243	One seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort
650.38	became increasingly important as the delivery of food
652.556	and water started rolling.
654.716	January and February are the dry months in Haiti,
656.174	yet many of the camps had developed standing water.
659.116	The only institution with detailed knowledge of Haiti's
661.238	floodplains had been leveled
662.535	in the earthquake, leadership inside.
665.543	So the question is, which camps are at risk,
668.118	how many people are in these camps, what's the
670.039	timeline for flooding, and given very limited resources
672.35	and infrastructure, how do we prioritize the relocation?
675.734	The data was incredibly disparate. The U.S. Army had
678.078	detailed knowledge for only a small section of the country.
681.007	There was data online from a 2006 environmental risk
683.518	conference, other geospatial data, none of it integrated.
686.182	The human goal here was to identify camps for relocation
689.14	based on priority need.
691.535	The computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospacial
693.975	information, social media data and relief organization
696.559	information to answer this question.
700.039	By implementing a superior process, what was otherwise
702.454	a task for 40 people over three months became
705.062	a simple job for three people in 40 hours,
708.238	all victories for human-computer symbiosis.
710.866	We're more than 50 years into Licklider's vision
712.92	for the future, and the data suggests that we should be
715.162	quite excited about tackling this century's hardest problems,
718.192	man and machine in cooperation together.
721.139	Thank you. (Applause)
723.336	(Applause)
