12.992	Ichthyology,
14.628	the study of fishes.
16.112	It looks like a big, boring word,
18.994	but it's actually quite exciting,
21.199	"because ichthyology is the only ""ology"""
24.196	"with ""YOLO"" in it."
25.551	(Laughter)
27.359	Now, to the cool kids in the audience,
29.209	you already know, YOLO stands for
29.209	"""you only live once,"""
33.41	and because I only have one life,
35.096	I'm going to spend it doing
35.096	what I always dreamt of doing:
37.883	seeing the hidden wonders of the world
37.883	and discovering new species.
41.068	And that's what I get to do.
42.873	Now, in recent years, I really focused
42.873	on caves for finding new species.
47.352	And it turns out, there's lots of new
47.352	cavefish species out there.
50.642	You just have to know where to look,
52.449	and to maybe be a little thin.
54.682	(Laughter)
55.8	Now, cavefishes can tell me
55.8	a lot about biology and geology.
60.214	They can tell me how the landmasses
60.214	around them have changed and moved
64.221	by being stuck in these little holes,
66.463	and they can tell me about
66.463	the evolution of sight, by being blind.
71.193	Now, fish have eyes
71.193	that are essentially the same as ours.
74.494	All vertebrates do, and each time
74.494	a fish species starts to adapt
78.346	to this dark, cold, cave environment,
80.782	over many, many generations,
80.782	they lose their eyes and their eyesight
84.743	until the end up like an eyeless
84.743	cavefish like this one here.
87.917	Now, each cavefish species
87.917	has evolved in a slightly different way,
91.778	and each one has a unique geological
91.778	and biological story to tell us,
95.874	and that's why it's so exciting
95.874	when we find a new species.
99.217	So this is a new species
99.217	we described, from southern Indiana.
103.075	We named it Amblyopsis hoosieri,
103.075	the Hoosier cavefish.
106.996	(Laughter)
108.081	Its closest relatives
108.081	are cavefishes in Kentucky,
111.034	in the Mammoth Cave system.
112.66	And they start to diverge
112.66	when the Ohio River split them
115.717	a few million years ago.
117.419	And in that time they developed
117.419	these subtle differences
120.186	in the genetic architecture
120.186	behind their blindness.
123.289	There's this gene called rhodopsin
123.289	that's super-critical for sight.
126.829	We have it, and these species have it too,
129.25	except one species has lost
129.25	all function in that gene,
132.147	and the other one maintains it.
134.234	So this sets up this beautiful
134.234	natural experiment
138.281	where we can look at the genes
138.281	behind our vision,
141.269	and at the very roots of how we can see.
145.047	But the genes in these cavefishes
146.785	can also tell us
146.785	about deep geological time,
149.595	maybe no more so
149.595	than in this species here.
152.079	This is a new species
152.079	we described from Madagascar
154.92	that we named Typhleotris mararybe.
158.245	"That means ""big sickness"" in Malagasy,"
161.534	for how sick we got trying
161.534	to collect this species.
164.614	Now, believe it or not,
166.216	swimming around sinkholes
166.216	full of dead things
168.83	and cave full of bat poop
170.737	isn't the smartest thing you could
170.737	be doing with your life,
173.57	but YOLO.
175.103	(Laughter)
178.922	Now, I love this species despite the fact
178.922	that it tried to kill us,
183.12	and that's because
183.12	this species in Madagascar,
185.939	its closest relatives
185.939	are 6,000 kilometers away,
188.787	cavefishes in Australia.
190.701	Now, there's no way a three-inch-long
190.701	freshwater cavefish
194.36	can swim across the Indian Ocean,
196.423	so what we found when we compared
196.423	the DNA of these species
199.278	is that they've been separated
199.278	for more than 100 million years,
202.599	or about the time that the southern
202.599	continents were last together.
207.875	So in fact, these species
207.875	didn't move at all.
210.105	It's the continents that moved them.
211.93	And so they give us, through their DNA,
213.977	this precise model and measure
216.422	of how to date and time
216.422	these ancient geological events.
221.064	Now, this species here is so new
223.32	I'm not even allowed
223.32	to tell you its name yet,
225.827	but I can tell you
225.827	it's a new species from Mexico,
228.513	and it's probably already extinct.
230.667	It's probably extinct because
230.667	the only known cave system it's from
234.038	was destroyed when a dam was built nearby.
236.714	Unfortunately for cavefishes,
238.7	their groundwater habitat
240.304	is also our main source of drinking water.
243.103	Now, we actually don't know
243.103	this species' closest relative, yet.
247.825	It doesn't appear to be
247.825	anything else in Mexico,
250.499	so maybe it's something in Cuba,
252.223	or Florida, or India.
254.83	But whatever it is, it might tell us
254.83	something new about the geology
259.359	of the Caribbean, or the biology
259.359	of how to better diagnose
262.591	certain types of blindness.
264.736	But I hope we discover this species
264.736	before it goes extinct too.
268.733	And I'm going to spend my one life
270.672	as an ichthyologist
270.672	trying to discover and save
274.233	these humble little blind cavefishes
276.827	that can tell us so much
276.827	about the geology of the planet
280.317	and the biology of how we see.
282.672	Thank you.
283.847	(Applause)
