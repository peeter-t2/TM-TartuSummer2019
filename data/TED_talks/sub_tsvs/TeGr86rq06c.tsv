12.621	What if I told you
12.621	there was a new technology
16.52	that, when placed in the hands
16.52	of doctors and nurses,
21.112	improved outcomes for children
21.112	and adults, patients of all ages;
27.311	reduced pain and suffering,
29.878	reduced time in the operating rooms,
33.091	reduced anesthetic times,
35.968	had the ultimate dose-response curve
37.89	that the more you did it,
39.66	the better it benefitted patients?
43.16	Here's a kicker: it has no side effects,
45.586	and it's available no matter
45.586	where care is delivered.
49.325	I can tell you as an ICU doctor
49.325	at Boston Children's Hospital,
52.791	this would be a game changer for me.
55.122	That technology is lifelike rehearsal.
60.533	This lifelike rehearsal is being delivered
60.533	through medical simulation.
65.711	I thought I would start with a case,
69.736	just to really describe
69.736	the challenge ahead,
72.47	and why this technology is not just
72.47	going to improve health care
75.865	but why it's critical to health care.
79.388	This is a child that's born, young girl.
82.285	"""Day of life zero,"" we call it,"
84.069	the first day of life,
84.069	just born into the world.
86.392	And just as she's being born,
87.807	we notice very quickly
87.807	that she is deteriorating.
90.759	Her heart rate is going up,
90.759	her blood pressure is going down,
93.696	she's breathing very, very fast.
96.097	And the reason for this
96.097	is displayed in this chest X-ray.
101.023	That's called a babygram,
102.358	a full X-ray of a child's body,
102.358	a little infant's body.
105.656	As you look on the top side of this,
107.586	that's where the heart and lungs
107.586	are supposed to be.
110.093	As you look at the bottom end,
110.093	that's where the abdomen is,
112.894	and that's where the intestines
112.894	are supposed to be.
115.34	And you can see how
115.34	there's sort of that translucent area
118.093	that made its way up into the right side
118.093	of this child's chest.
121.288	And those are the intestines --
121.288	in the wrong place.
125.32	As a result, they're pushing on the lungs
127.514	and making it very difficult
127.514	for this poor baby to breathe.
131.038	The fix for this problem
132.555	is to take this child immediately
132.555	to the operating room,
135.233	bring those intestines
135.233	back into the abdomen,
137.388	let the lungs expand
138.827	and allow this child to breathe again.
141.307	But before she can go
141.307	to the operating room,
143.39	she must get whisked away
143.39	to the ICU, where I work.
146.706	I work with surgical teams.
148.598	We gather around her,
149.924	and we place this child
149.924	on heart-lung bypass.
155.416	We put her to sleep,
157.061	we make a tiny
157.061	little incision in the neck,
159.681	we place catheters into the major
159.681	vessels of the neck --
162.843	and I can tell you that these vessels
162.843	are about the size of a pen,
166.561	the tip of a pen --
168.49	and then we have blood
168.49	drawn from the body,
170.598	we bring it through a machine,
170.598	it gets oxygenated,
173.03	and it goes back into the body.
174.906	We save her life,
176.506	and get her safely to the operating room.
180.87	Here's the problem:
183.692	these disorders --
185.289	what is known is congenital
185.289	diaphragmatic hernia --
188.602	this hole in the diaphragm that has
188.602	allowed these intestines to sneak up --
192.222	these disorders are rare.
195.113	Even in the best hands in the world,
198.962	there is still a challenge
198.962	to get the volume --
202.496	the natural volume of these patients --
204.418	in order to get our expertise
204.418	curve at 100 percent.
206.964	They just don't present that often.
210.549	So how do you make the rare common?
215.921	Here's the other problem:
218.179	in the health care system
218.179	that I trained for over 20 years,
222.804	what currently exists,
224.013	the model of training is called
224.013	the apprenticeship model.
226.981	It's been around for centuries.
228.92	It's based on this idea that you see
228.92	a surgery maybe once,
232.892	maybe several times,
234.444	you then go do that surgery,
237.258	and then ultimately you teach
237.258	that surgery to the next generation.
242.262	And implicit in this model --
245.036	I don't need to tell you this --
247.234	is that we practice on the very patients
247.234	that we are delivering care to.
254.123	That's a problem.
259.096	I think there's a better approach.
261.317	Medicine may very well be the last
261.317	high-stakes industry
265.706	that does not practice prior to game time.
270.128	I want to describe to you a better
270.128	approach through medical simulation.
276.139	Well, the first thing we did is we went
276.139	to other high-stakes industries
279.54	that had been using this type
279.54	of methodology for decades.
282.434	This is nuclear power.
284.123	Nuclear power runs scenarios
284.123	on a regular basis
288.188	in order to practice
288.188	what they hope will never occur.
291.932	And as we're all very familiar,
291.932	the airline industry --
295.804	we all get on planes now,
295.804	comforted by the idea
299.125	that pilots and crews have trained
299.125	on simulators much like these,
304.945	training on scenarios
304.945	that we hope will never occur,
307.53	but we know if they did,
309.734	they would be prepared for the worst.
312.75	In fact, the airline industry has gone
312.75	as far as to create fuselages
317.179	of simulation environments,
318.746	because of the importance
318.746	of the team coming together.
322.633	This is an evacuation drill simulator.
325.526	So again, if that ever were to happen,
325.526	these rare, rare events,
329.417	they're ready to act
329.417	on the drop of a dime.
334.706	I guess the most compelling for me
334.706	in some ways is the sports industry --
340.048	arguably high stakes.
342.293	You think about a baseball team:
342.293	baseball players practice.
345.578	I think it's a beautiful example
345.578	of progressive training.
348.273	The first thing they do
348.273	is go out to spring training.
351.057	They go to a spring training camp,
353.345	perhaps a simulator in baseball.
356.392	They're not on the real field,
356.392	but they're on a simulated field,
359.458	and they're playing in the pregame season.
361.515	Then they make their way to the field
361.515	during the season games,
365.036	and what's the first thing they do
365.036	before they start the game?
368.158	They go into the batting cage
368.158	and do batting practice for hours,
372.613	having different types of pitches
372.613	being thrown at them,
375.968	hitting ball after ball
375.968	as they limber their muscles,
380.324	getting ready for the game itself.
382.321	And here's the most
382.321	phenomenal part of this,
386.345	and for all of you who watch
386.345	any sport event,
388.869	you will see this phenomenon happen.
391.661	The batter gets into the batter's box,
394.373	the pitcher gets ready to pitch.
396.518	Right before the pitch is thrown,
399.648	what does that batter do?
400.881	The batter steps out of the box
404.097	and takes a practice swing.
406.164	He wouldn't do it any other way.
409.212	I want to talk to you about how
409.212	we're building practice swings like this
412.651	in medicine.
413.83	We are building batting cages
413.83	for the patients that we care about
418.036	at Boston Children's.
419.288	I want to use this case
419.288	that we recently built.
422.304	It's the case of a four-year-old
422.304	who had a progressively enlarging head,
426.599	and as a result,
427.9	had loss of developmental milestones,
427.9	neurologic milestones,
431.056	and the reason for this problem is here --
434.097	it's called hydrocephalus.
436.372	So, a quick study in neurosurgery.
439.267	There's the brain,
440.456	and you can see the cranium
440.456	surrounding the brain.
443.469	What surrounds the brain,
443.469	between the brain and cranium,
446.837	is something called
446.837	cerebrospinal fluid or fluid,
450.079	which acts as a shock absorber.
452.406	In your heads right now,
453.752	there is cerebrospinal fluid
453.752	just bathing your brains
457.033	and making its way around.
458.883	It's produced in one area
458.883	and flows through,
461.533	and then is re-exchanged.
462.848	And this beautiful flow pattern
462.848	occurs for all of us.
466.265	But unfortunately in some children,
468.334	there's a blockage of this flow pattern,
470.861	much like a traffic jam.
472.885	As a result, the fluid accumulates,
475.732	and the brain is pushed aside.
478.947	It has difficulty growing.
481.421	As a result, the child loses
481.421	neurologic milestones.
484.938	This is a devastating disease in children.
488.793	The cure for this is surgery.
491.891	The traditional surgery is to take
491.891	a bit of the cranium off,
494.825	a bit of the skull,
496.007	drain this fluid out,
496.007	stick a drain in place,
498.974	and then eventually bring
498.974	this drain internal to the body.
501.726	Big operation.
503.916	But some great news is that advances
503.916	in neurosurgical care
508.257	have allowed us to develop
508.257	minimally invasive approaches
511.99	to this surgery.
513.174	Through a small pinhole,
513.174	a camera can be inserted,
518.752	led into the deep brain structure,
521.504	and cause a little hole in a membrane
521.504	that allows all that fluid to drain,
525.481	much like it would in a sink.
527.553	All of a sudden, the brain
527.553	is no longer under pressure,
530.692	can re-expand
532.173	and we cure the child
532.173	through a single-hole incision.
536.478	But here's the problem:
537.917	hydrocephalus is relatively rare.
540.73	And there are no good training methods
543.164	to get really good at getting
543.164	this scope to the right place.
546.812	But surgeons have been quite creative
546.812	about this, even our own.
551.15	And they've come up with training models.
553.182	Here's the current training model.
554.931	(Laughter)
556.913	I kid you not.
558.594	This is a red pepper,
558.594	not made in Hollywood;
561.057	it's real red pepper.
562.82	And what surgeons do is they stick
562.82	a scope into the pepper,
565.791	"and they do what is called a ""seedectomy."""
568.913	(Laughter)
570.704	They use this scope to remove seeds
570.704	using a little tweezer.
577.632	And that is a way to get under their belts
580.284	the rudimentary components
580.284	of doing this surgery.
583.936	Then they head right into
583.936	the apprenticeship model,
586.396	seeing many of them
586.396	as they present themselves,
589.292	then doing it, and then teaching it --
591.579	waiting for these patients to arrive.
594.347	We can do a lot better.
595.91	We are manufacturing
595.91	reproductions of children
600.661	in order for surgeons and surgical
600.661	teams to rehearse
604.591	in the most relevant possible ways.
606.995	Let me show you this.
608.966	Here's my team
610.498	in what's called the SIM Engineering
610.498	Division of the Simulator Program.
615.14	This is an amazing team of individuals.
618.007	They are mechanical engineers;
620.306	you're seeing here, illustrators.
622.755	They take primary data
622.755	from CT scans and MRIs,
627.351	translate it into digital information,
630.705	animate it,
632.035	put it together into the components
632.035	of the child itself,
636.85	surface-scan elements of the child
636.85	that have been casted as needed,
640.668	depending on the surgery itself,
643.277	and then take this digital data
643.277	and be able to output it
647.192	on state-of-the-art,
647.192	three-dimensional printing devices
650.964	that allow us to print the components
653.258	exactly to the micron detail of what
653.258	the child's anatomy will look like.
658.95	You can see here,
660.278	the skull of this child being printed
662.736	in the hours before
662.736	we performed this surgery.
666.438	But we could not do this work
669.038	without our dear friends on the West Coast
669.038	in Hollywood, California.
674.6	These are individuals
674.6	that are incredibly talented
677.854	at being able to recreate reality.
680.302	It was not a long leap for us.
684.75	The more we got into this field,
686.35	the more it became clear to us
686.35	that we are doing cinematography.
690.81	We're doing filmmaking,
692.711	it's just that the actors are not actors.
695.729	They're real doctors and nurses.
699.01	So these are some photos
699.01	of our dear friends at Fractured FX
702.413	in Hollywood California,
703.906	an Emmy-Award-winning
703.906	special effects firm.
707.504	This is Justin Raleigh and his group --
710.698	this is not one of our patients --
712.37	(Laughter)
713.752	but kind of the exquisite work
713.752	that these individuals do.
716.844	We have now collaborated
716.844	and fused our experience,
720.472	bringing their group
720.472	to Boston Children's Hospital,
722.902	sending our group
722.902	out to Hollywood, California
725.582	and exchanging around this
726.975	to be able to develop
726.975	these type of simulators.
730.002	What I'm about to show you
730.002	is a reproduction of this child.
738.992	You'll notice here that every hair
738.992	on the child's head is reproduced.
744.144	And in fact, this is also
744.144	that reproduced child --
747.871	and I apologize for any queasy stomachs,
751.088	but that is a reproduction and simulation
753.972	of the child they're about to operate on.
758.313	Here's that membrane we had talked about,
760.775	the inside of this child's brain.
763.358	What you're going to be seeing here
763.358	is, on one side, the actual patient,
768.35	and on the other side, the simulator.
770.653	As I mentioned, a scope, a little camera,
770.653	needs to make its way down,
775.027	and you're seeing that here.
776.452	It needs to make a small hole
776.452	in this membrane
778.8	and allow this fluid to seep out.
782.975	I won't do a quiz show to see
782.975	who thinks which side is which,
788.782	but on the right is the simulator.
792.503	So surgeons can now produce
792.503	training opportunities,
796.325	do these surgeries
796.325	as many times as they want,
799.402	to their heart's content,
799.402	until they feel comfortable.
802.268	And then, and only then,
802.268	bring the child into the operating room.
805.857	But we don't stop here.
807.05	We know that a key step to this
807.05	is not just the skill itself,
811.384	but combining that skill with a team
811.384	who's going to deliver that care.
815.939	Now we turn to Formula One.
818.845	And here is an example
818.845	of a technician putting on a tire
822.119	and doing that time and time
822.119	again on this car.
825.352	But that is very quickly
825.352	going to be incorporated
828.361	within team-training experiences,
830.316	now as a full team orchestrating
830.316	the exchange of tires
834.549	and getting this car back on the speedway.
838.094	We've done that step in health care,
841.395	so now what you're about to see
841.395	is a simulated operation.
846.58	We've taken the simulator
846.58	I just described to you,
848.991	we've brought it into the operating room
848.991	at Boston Children's Hospital,
852.416	and these individuals --
852.416	these native teams, operative teams --
856.095	are doing the surgery before the surgery.
859.642	Operate twice;
861.403	cut once.
862.939	Let me show that to you.
865.237	(Video) Surgical team member 1:
865.237	You want the head down or head up?
868.374	STM 2: Can you lower it down to 10?
870.102	STM 3: And then lower
870.102	the whole table down a little bit?
872.775	STM 4: Table coming down.
876.676	STM 3: All right, this
876.676	is behaving like a vessel.
879.405	Could we have the scissors back, please?
881.516	STM 5: I'm taking my gloves,
881.516	8 to 8 1/2, all right? I'll be right in.
884.841	STM 6: Great! Thank you.
888.156	Peter Weinstock: It's really amazing.
890.013	The second step to this,
890.013	which is critical,
892.129	is we take these teams out
892.129	immediately and debrief them.
895.252	We use the same technologies
896.74	that are used in Lean
896.74	and Six Sigma in the military,
901.452	and we bring them out
901.452	and talk about what went right,
904.561	but more importantly,
906.23	we talk about what didn't go well,
908.721	and how we're going to fix it.
910.68	Then we bring them right back in
910.68	and do it again.
913.458	Deliberative batting practice
913.458	in the moments when it matters most.
920.258	Let's go back to this case now.
922.903	Same child,
924.304	but now let me describe
924.304	how we care for this child
926.718	at Boston Children's Hospital.
928.205	This child was born
928.205	at three o'clock in the morning.
930.715	At two o'clock in the morning,
932.746	we assembled the team,
934.896	and took the reproduced anatomy
936.721	that we would gain
936.721	out of scans and images,
940.45	and brought that team
940.45	to the virtual bedside,
943.24	to a simulated bedside --
944.851	the same team that's going to operate
944.851	on this child in the hours ahead --
948.416	and we have them do the procedure.
951.411	Let me show you a moment of this.
954.032	This is not a real incision.
957.271	And the baby has not yet been born.
960.933	Imagine this.
963.953	So now the conversations
963.953	that I have with families
967.865	in the intensive care unit
967.865	at Boston Children's Hospital
970.589	are totally different.
972.582	Imagine this conversation:
