12.903	Thirteen years ago,
15.069	we set ourselves a goal to end poverty.
21.45	After some success,
24.069	we've hit a big hurdle.
27.123	The aftermath of the financial crisis
29.644	has begun to hit aid payments,
32.369	which have fallen for two consecutive years.
37.133	My question is whether the lessons learned
41.112	from saving the financial system
45.032	can be used to help us overcome that hurdle
48.514	and help millions.
51.719	Can we simply print money for aid?
58.629	"""Surely not."""
60.136	It's a common reaction.
62.145	(Laughter)
63.167	It's a quick talk.
65.677	Others channel John McEnroe.
70.454	"""You cannot be serious!"""
72.426	Now, I can't do the accent, but I am serious,
77.357	thanks to these two children,
81.357	who, as you'll learn, are very much at the heart
85.037	of my talk.
87.529	On the left, we have Pia.
90.495	She lives in England.
92.085	She has two loving parents,
95.229	one of whom is standing right here.
100.129	Dorothy, on the right,
102.521	lives in rural Kenya.
105.42	She's one of 13,000 orphans
108.059	and vulnerable children
109.564	who are assisted by a charity that I support.
114.912	I do that because I believe
117.692	that Dorothy, like Pia,
120.013	deserves the best life chances
123.351	that we can afford to give her.
125.915	You'll all agree with me, I'm sure.
128.954	The U.N. agrees too.
131.564	Their overriding aim
133.616	for international aid
135.692	is to strive for a life of dignity for all.
141.834	But -- and here's that hurdle --
146.354	can we afford our aid aspirations?
150.904	History suggests not.
154.197	In 1970, governments set themselves a target
159.519	to increase overseas aid payments
162.014	to 0.7 percent
164.283	of their national income.
165.922	As you can see, a big gap opens up
170.199	between actual aid and that target.
174.793	But then come the Millennium Development Goals,
179.056	eight ambitious targets
181.465	to be met by 2015.
185.373	If I tell you that just one of those targets
188.368	is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty,
192.551	you get a sense of the ambition.
195.369	There's also been some success.
198.974	The number of people living
200.283	on less than $1.25 a day has halved.
206.259	But a lot remains to be done in two years.
209.986	One in eight remain hungry.
213.677	In the context of this auditorium,
216.288	the front two rows aren't going to get any food.
220.736	We can't settle for that,
222.894	which is why the concern about the eighth goal,
227.398	which relates to funding,
229.218	which I said at the beginning is falling,
232.132	is so troubling.
236.592	So what can be done?
238.646	Well, I work in financial markets,
241.638	not development.
244.089	I study the behavior of investors,
247.126	how they react to policy and the economy.
252.712	It gives me a different angle on the aid issue.
257.345	But it took an innocent question
259.866	from my then-four-year-old daughter
262.501	to make me appreciate that.
266.56	Pia and I were on the way to a local cafe
269.755	and we passed a man collecting for charity.
274.171	I didn't have any change to give him,
275.722	and she was disappointed.
278.223	Once in the cafe, Pia takes out her coloring book
282.001	and starts scribbling.
283.743	After a little while, I ask her what she's doing,
287.767	and she shows me a drawing
290.303	of a Â£5 note
292.515	to give to the man outside.
294.558	It's so sweet,
295.811	and more generous than Dad would have been.
298.911	But of course I explained to her,
300.837	"""You can't do that; it's not allowed."""
303.34	To which I get the classic four-year-old response:
308.034	"""Why not?"""
310.582	Now I'm excited, because I actually think
312.996	I can answer this time.
314.837	So I launch into an explanation of how
317.752	an unlimited supply of money
321.067	chasing a limited number of goods
324.246	sends prices to the moon.
331.036	Something about that exchange stuck with me,
335.355	not because of the look of relief
337.458	on Pia's face when I finally finished,
339.721	but because it related
344.511	to the sanctity of the money supply,
349.412	a sanctity that had been challenged and questioned
353.714	by the reaction of central banks
356.633	to the financial crisis.
359.109	To reassure investors,
361.676	central banks began buying assets
366.573	to try and encourage investors to do the same.
371.609	They funded these purchases
375.207	with money they created themselves.
378.756	The money wasn't actually physically printed.
382.042	It's still sort of locked away
382.042	in the banking system today.
385.656	But the amount created was unprecedented.
390.857	Together, the central banks of the U.S.,
394.362	U.K and Japan
396.232	increased the stock of money in their economies
399.622	by 3.7 trillion dollars.
403.65	That's three times, in fact
403.65	that's more than three times,
407.105	the total physical stock of dollar notes in circulation.
411.917	Three times!
416.165	Before the crisis,
418.075	this would have been utterly unthinkable,
423.023	yet it was accepted remarkably quickly.
430.487	The price of gold,
432.514	an asset thought to protect against inflation,
435.262	did jump,
438.088	but investors bought other assets
440.886	that offered little protection from inflation.
443.517	They bought fixed income securities, bonds.
447.061	They bought equities too.
449.828	For all the scare stories,
452.487	the actual actions of investors
455.516	spoke of rapid acceptance and confidence.
462.041	That confidence was based on two pillars.
467.716	The first was that, after years
470.181	of keeping inflation under control,
473.437	central banks were trusted
476.244	to take the money-printing away
479.531	if inflation became a threat.
483.152	Secondly, inflation simply never became a threat.
489.381	As you can see, in the United States,
491.249	inflation for most of this period
493.29	remained below average.
496.747	It was the same elsewhere.
500.019	So how does all this relate to aid?
503.436	Well, this is where Dorothy
507.311	and the Mango Tree charity
509.777	that supports her comes in.
512.335	I was at one of their fundraising events
514.432	earlier this year,
515.652	and I was inspired to give a one-off donation
519.401	when I remembered that my firm
522.239	offers to match the charitable contributions
525.498	its employees make.
528.241	So think of this:
530.967	Instead of just being able to help Dorothy
533.254	and four of her classmates
535.96	to go through secondary school for a few years,
538.24	I was able to double my contribution.
542.544	Brilliant.
544.957	So following that conversation with my daughter,
550.92	and seeing the absence of inflation
553.557	in the face of money-printing,
555.504	and knowing that international aid payments
558.591	were falling at just the wrong time,
561.903	this made me wonder:
565.864	Could we match
567.959	but just on a much grander scale?
574.009	"Let's call this scheme ""Print Aid."""
578.462	And here's how it might work.
581.12	Provided it saw little inflation risk from doing so,
586.277	the central bank would be mandated
588.587	to match the government's overseas aid payments
591.98	up to a certain limit.
594.447	Governments have been aiming to get aid
596.52	to 0.7 percent for years,
598.238	so let's set the limit at half of that,
601.123	0.35 percent of their income.
605.232	So it would work like this: If in a given year
607.304	the government gave 0.2 percent of its income
609.99	to overseas aid,
611.122	the central bank would simply top it up
612.605	with a further 0.2 percent.
615.781	So far so good.
619.382	How risky is this?
622.062	Well, this involves the creation of money
626.304	to buy goods, not assets.
629.112	It sounds more inflationary already, doesn't it.
632.665	But there are two important mitigating factors here.
637.093	The first is that by definition,
640.636	this money printed would be spent overseas.
645.786	So it's not obvious how it leads to inflation
649.327	in the country doing the actual printing
653.736	unless it leads to a currency
653.736	depreciation of that country.
658.67	That is unlikely for the second reason:
661.963	the scale of the money that would be printed
664.844	under this scheme.
667.664	So let's think of an example
670.804	where Print Aid was in place
674.347	in the U.S., U.K. and Japan.
678.689	To match the aid payments made
680.992	by those governments over the last four years,
683.728	Print Aid would have generated
690.29	What would that look like
692.477	in the context of the increase in the money stock
696.079	that had already happened in those countries
698.355	to save the financial system?
700.436	Are you read for this?
703.593	You might struggle to see that at the back,
705.677	because the gap is quite small.
709.247	So what we're saying here
711.695	is that we took a $3.7 trillion gamble
715.163	to save our financial systems,
717.539	and you know what, it paid off.
719.594	There was no inflation.
722.167	Are we really saying that it's not worth the risk
725.473	to print an extra 200 billion for aid?
730.125	Would the risks really be that different?
732.034	To me, it's not that clear.
734.577	What is clear is the impact on aid.
737.935	Even though this is the printing
740.051	of just three central banks,
741.887	the global aid that's given
745.508	over this period is up by almost 40 percent.
750.429	Aid as a proportion of national income
752.86	all of a sudden is at a 40-year high.
756.31	Now, we don't get to 0.7 percent.
759.297	Governments are still incentivized to give.
762.042	But you know what, that's the 
762.042	point of a matching scheme.
766.535	So I think what we've learned
770.35	is that the risks from this money creation scheme
774.944	are quite modest,
777.725	but the benefits
780.525	are potentially huge.
782.991	Imagine what we could do
782.991	with 40 percent more funding.
786.294	We might be able to feed the front row.
791.265	The thing that I fear, the only thing that I fear,
793.963	apart from the fact that I've run out of time,
795.687	is that the window of opportunity for this idea
800.404	is a short one.
803.237	Today, money creation by central banks
807.062	is an accepted policy tool.
809.976	That may not always be the case.
812.457	Today there are universally agreed aims
816.82	for international aid.
818.711	That may not always be the case.
822.331	Today might be the only time
824.969	that these two things coincide,
827.852	such that we can afford the aid
831.827	that we've always aspired to give.
835.47	So, can we print money for international aid?
843.9	I seriously believe the question should be,
847.638	why not?
849.701	Thank you very much.
852.514	(Applause)
