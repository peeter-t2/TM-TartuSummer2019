16.26	I'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership
18.26	in the 21st century.
20.26	In the 21st century, we need to actually look at --
23.26	and what I'm actually going to encourage you to consider today --
26.26	is to go back to our school days
28.26	when we learned how to count.
30.26	But I think it's time for us to think about what we count.
33.26	Because what we actually count
35.26	truly counts.
37.26	Let me start by telling you a little story.
39.26	This is Van Quach.
41.26	She came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam.
44.26	She changed her name to Vivian
46.26	because she wanted to fit in here in America.
48.26	Her first job was at an inner-city motel
50.26	in San Francisco as a maid.
52.26	I happened to buy that motel
54.26	about three months after Vivian started working there.
57.26	So Vivian and I have been working together for 23 years.
61.26	With the youthful idealism of a 26-year-old,
63.26	in 1987,
65.26	I started my company and I called it Joie de Vivre,
67.26	a very impractical name,
70.26	because I actually was looking to create joy of life.
73.26	And this first hotel that I bought, motel,
76.26	was a pay-by-the-hour, no-tell motel
79.26	in the inner-city of San Francisco.
81.26	As I spent time with Vivian,
83.26	I saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre
86.26	in how she did her work.
88.26	It made me question and curious:
90.26	How could someone actually find joy
92.26	in cleaning toilets for a living?
95.26	So I spent time with Vivian, and I saw that
98.26	she didn't find joy in cleaning toilets.
100.26	Her job, her goal and her calling
102.26	was not to become the world's greatest toilet scrubber.
105.26	What counts for Vivian was the emotional connection
107.26	she created with her fellow employees and our guests.
110.26	And what gave her inspiration and meaning
112.26	was the fact that she was taking care of people
115.26	who were far away from home.
117.26	Because Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home.
120.26	That very human lesson,
122.26	more than 20 years ago,
124.26	served me well during the last
126.26	economic downturn we had.
129.26	In the wake of the dotcom crash and 9/11,
131.26	San Francisco Bay Area hotels
133.26	went through the largest percentage revenue drop
135.26	in the history of American hotels.
137.26	We were the largest operator of hotels in the Bay Area,
140.26	so we were particularly vulnerable.
142.26	But also back then,
144.26	remember we stopped eating French fries in this country.
146.26	Well, not exactly, of course not.
149.26	"We started eating ""freedom fries,"""
152.26	and we started boycotting anything that was French.
155.26	Well, my name of my company, Joie de Vivre --
158.26	so I started getting these letters
160.26	from places like Alabama and Orange County
163.26	saying to me that they were going to boycott my company
165.26	because they thought we were a French company.
167.26	"And I'd write them back, and I'd say, ""What a minute. We're not French."
170.26	"We're an American company. We're based in San Francisco."""
173.26	"And I'd get a terse response: ""Oh, that's worse."""
175.26	(Laughter)
178.26	So one particular day
180.26	when I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre,
182.26	I ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices.
185.26	And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore
188.26	looking for a business solution.
190.26	But given my befuddled state of mind, I ended up
192.26	in the self-help section very quickly.
194.26	That's where I got reacquainted with
196.26	"Abraham Maslow's ""hierarchy of needs."""
199.26	I took one psychology class in college,
201.26	and I learned about this guy, Abraham Maslow,
203.26	as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs.
205.26	But as I sat there for four hours,
208.26	the full afternoon, reading Maslow,
211.26	I recognized something
213.26	that is true of most leaders.
215.26	One of the simplest facts in business
217.26	is something that we often neglect,
219.26	and that is that we're all human.
221.26	Each of us, no matter what our role is in business,
224.26	has some hierarchy of needs
226.26	in the workplace.
228.26	So as I started reading more Maslow,
230.26	what I started to realize is that
232.26	Maslow, later in his life,
234.26	wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual
236.26	and apply it to the collective,
238.26	to organizations and specifically to business.
241.26	But unfortunately, he died prematurely in 1970,
244.26	and so he wasn't really able to live that dream completely.
246.26	So I realized in that dotcom crash
249.26	that my role in life was to channel Abe Maslow.
252.26	And that's what I did a few years ago
254.26	when I took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramid
257.26	and turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid,
260.26	which is survival, success and transformation.
263.26	It's not just fundamental in business, it's fundamental in life.
266.26	And we started asking ourselves the questions
268.26	about how we were actually addressing
270.26	the higher needs, these transformational needs
272.26	for our key employees in the company.
275.26	These three levels of the hierarchy needs
277.26	relate to the five levels
279.26	of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
281.26	But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing
283.26	the higher needs of our employees and our customers,
286.26	I realized we had no metrics.
288.26	We had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right.
291.26	So we started asking ourselves:
293.26	What kind of less obvious metrics
295.26	could we use to actually evaluate
298.26	our employees' sense of meaning,
300.26	or our customers' sense of emotional connection with us?
303.26	For example, we actually started asking our employees,
305.26	do they understand the mission of our company,
307.26	and do they feel like they believe in it,
309.26	can they actually influence it,
311.26	and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it?
314.26	We started asking our customers,
316.26	did they feel an emotional connection with us,
318.26	in one of seven different kinds of ways.
321.26	Miraculously, as we asked these questions
323.26	and started giving attention higher up the pyramid,
326.26	what we found is we created more loyalty.
328.26	Our customer loyalty skyrocketed.
330.26	Our employee turnover dropped
332.26	to one-third of the industry average,
334.26	and during that five year dotcom bust,
336.26	we tripled in size.
338.26	As I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there
341.26	and asking them how they were getting through that time,
343.26	what they told me over and over again
345.26	was that they just manage what they can measure.
347.26	What we can measure is that tangible stuff
349.26	at the bottom of the pyramid.
351.26	They didn't even see the intangible stuff
353.26	higher up the pyramid.
355.26	So I started asking myself the question:
357.26	How can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible?
359.26	If we're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure,
362.26	and all we can measure is the tangible in life,
365.26	we're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid.
368.26	So I went out and studied a bunch of things,
370.26	and I found a survey that showed
372.26	that 94 percent
374.26	of business leaders worldwide
376.26	believe that the intangibles are important in their business,
378.26	things like intellectual property,
380.26	their corporate culture, their brand loyalty,
382.26	and yet, only five percent of those same leaders
385.26	actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business.
388.26	So as leaders, we understand
390.26	that intangibles are important,
392.26	but we don't have a clue how to measure them.
395.26	So here's another Einstein quote:
397.26	"""Not everything that can be counted counts,"
400.26	"and not everything that counts can be counted."""
404.26	I hate to argue with Einstein,
406.26	but if that which is most valuable
409.26	in our life and our business
411.26	actually can't be counted or valued,
414.26	aren't we going to spend our lives
416.26	just mired in measuring the mundane?
419.26	It was that sort of heady question about what counts
422.26	that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week
425.26	and fly off to the Himalayan peaks.
428.26	I flew off to a place that's been shrouded in mystery for centuries,
431.26	a place some folks call Shangri-La.
434.26	It's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid
437.26	to becoming a transformational
439.26	role model for the world.
441.26	I went to Bhutan.
443.26	The teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man,
445.26	but this was back in 1972,
448.26	when he ascended to the throne
450.26	two days after his father passed away.
452.26	At age 17, he started asking the kinds of questions
455.26	that you'd expect of someone with a beginner's mind.
457.26	On a trip through India,
459.26	early in his reign as king,
462.26	he was asked by an Indian journalist
464.26	about the Bhutanese GDP,
466.26	the size of the Bhutanese GDP.
469.26	The king responded in a fashion
471.26	that actually has transformed us four decades later.
474.26	"He said the following, he said: ""Why are we so obsessed"
477.26	and focused with gross domestic product?
479.26	Why don't we care more about
481.26	"gross national happiness?"""
483.26	Now, in essence, the king was asking us to consider
486.26	an alternative definition of success,
488.26	what has come to be known as
490.26	GNH, or gross national happiness.
493.26	Most world leaders didn't take notice,
495.26	"and those that did thought this was just ""Buddhist economics."""
499.26	But the king was serious.
501.26	This was a notable moment,
503.26	because this was the first time a world leader
505.26	in almost 200 years
507.26	had suggested
509.26	that intangible of happiness --
511.26	that leader 200 years ago,
513.26	Thomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence --
518.26	this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness
520.26	is something that we should measure,
522.26	and it's something we should actually value
524.26	as government officials.
526.26	For the next three dozen years as king,
529.26	this king actually started measuring
532.26	and managing around happiness in Bhutan --
535.26	including, just recently, taking his country
537.26	from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy
540.26	with no bloodshed, no coup.
542.26	Bhutan, for those of you who don't know it,
544.26	is the newest democracy in the world, just two years ago.
547.26	So as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement,
550.26	I got to really understand what they're doing.
552.26	And I got to spend some time with the prime minister.
554.26	Over dinner, I asked him an impertinent question.
558.26	I asked him,
560.26	"""How can you create and measure"
563.26	something which evaporates --
565.26	"in other words, happiness?"""
567.26	And he's a very wise man, and he said,
569.26	"""Listen, Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness."
572.26	We create the conditions for happiness to occur.
575.26	"In other words, we create a habitat of happiness."""
577.26	Wow, that's interesting.
579.26	He said that they have a science behind that art,
582.26	and they've actually created four essential pillars,
584.26	nine key indicators
586.26	and 72 different metrics
588.26	that help them to measure their GNH.
591.26	One of those key indicators is:
594.26	How do the Bhutanese feel about
596.26	how they spend their time each day?
598.26	It's a good question. How do you feel about
600.26	how you spend your time each day?
602.26	Time is one of the scarcest resources
604.26	in the modern world.
606.26	And yet, of course,
608.26	that little intangible piece of data
610.26	doesn't factor into our GDP calculations.
612.26	As I spent my week up in the Himalayas,
614.26	I started to imagine
616.26	what I call an emotional equation.
619.26	And it focuses on something I read long ago
622.26	from a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel.
624.26	How many know him? Anybody?
629.26	and he suggested that happiness
631.26	is not about having what you want;
634.26	instead, it's about wanting what you have.
637.26	Or in other words, I think the Bhutanese believe
640.26	happiness equals wanting what you have --
642.26	imagine gratitude --
644.26	divided by having what you want --
647.26	gratification.
649.26	The Bhutanese aren't on some aspirational treadmill,
652.26	constantly focused on what they don't have.
655.26	Their religion, their isolation,
657.26	their deep respect for their culture
659.26	and now the principles of their GNH movement
661.26	all have fostered a sense of gratitude
663.26	about what they do have.
665.26	How many of us here, as TEDsters in the audience,
668.26	spend more of our time
670.26	in the bottom half of this equation, in the denominator?
673.26	We are a bottom-heavy culture
675.26	in more ways than one.
677.26	(Laughter)
679.26	The reality is, in Western countries,
682.26	quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness
685.26	as if happiness is something that we have to go out --
688.26	an object that we're supposed to get, or maybe many objects.
691.26	Actually, in fact, if you look in the dictionary,
693.26	many dictionaries define pursuit
697.26	"as to ""chase with hostility."""
700.26	Do we pursue happiness with hostility?
703.26	Good question. But back to Bhutan.
706.26	Bhutan's bordered on its north and south
709.26	by 38 percent of the world's population.
711.26	Could this little country,
714.26	like a startup in a mature industry,
716.26	be the spark plug that influences
719.26	a 21st century
721.26	of middle-class in China and India?
723.26	Bhutan's created the ultimate export,
726.26	a new global currency of well-being,
729.26	and there are 40 countries around the world today
731.26	that are studying their own GNH.
733.26	You may have heard, this last fall
735.26	Nicolas Sarkozy in France
737.26	announcing the results of an 18-month study
740.26	by two Nobel economists,
742.26	focusing on happiness and wellness in France.
744.26	Sarkozy suggested that
746.26	world leaders should stop
748.26	myopically focusing on GDP
750.26	and consider a new index,
752.26	"what some French are calling a ""joie de vivre index."""
755.26	I like it.
757.26	Co-branding opportunities.
759.26	Just three days ago, three days ago here at TED,
761.26	we had a simulcast of David Cameron,
763.26	potentially the next prime minister of the UK,
766.26	quoting one of my favorite speeches of all-time,
769.26	Robert Kennedy's poetic speech from 1968
772.26	when he suggested that we're
774.26	myopically focused on the wrong thing
776.26	and that GDP is a misplaced metric.
779.26	So it suggests that the momentum is shifting.
782.26	I've taken that Robert Kennedy quote,
784.26	and I've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here.
787.26	This is a collection of things
789.26	that Robert Kennedy said in that quote.
791.26	GDP counts everything from air pollution
793.26	to the destruction of our redwoods.
796.26	But it doesn't count the health of our children
798.26	or the integrity of our public officials.
801.26	As you look at these two columns here,
804.26	doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us
806.26	to start figuring out a new way to count,
808.26	a new way to imagine
810.26	what's important to us in life?
812.26	(Applause)
816.26	Certainly Robert Kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that.
819.26	"He said GDP ""measures everything in short,"
822.26	"except that which makes life worthwhile."""
825.26	Wow.
827.26	So how do we do that?
829.26	Let me say one thing we can just start doing
831.26	ten years from now, at least in this country.
833.26	Why in the heck in America
835.26	are we doing a census in 2010?
837.26	We're spending 10 billion dollars on the census.
840.26	We're asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity.
842.26	But all of those questions are tangible.
845.26	They're about demographics.
847.26	They're about where you live, how many people you live with,
849.26	and whether you own your home or not.
851.26	That's about it.
853.26	We're not asking meaningful metrics.
855.26	We're not asking important questions.
857.26	We're not asking anything that's intangible.
859.26	Abe Maslow said long ago
861.26	something you've heard before, but you didn't realize it was him.
864.26	"He said, ""If the only tool you have is a hammer,"
867.26	"everything starts to look like a nail."""
870.26	We've been fooled by our tool.
872.26	Excuse that expression.
874.26	(Laughter)
876.26	We've been fooled by our tool.
878.26	GDP has been our hammer.
881.26	And our nail has been a 19th- and 20th-century
884.26	industrial-era model of success.
887.26	And yet, 64 percent
889.26	of the world's GDP today
891.26	is in that intangible industry we call service,
893.26	the service industry, the industry I'm in.
896.26	And only 36 percent is in the tangible industries
898.26	of manufacturing and agriculture.
900.26	So maybe it's time that we get a bigger toolbox, right?
903.26	Maybe it's time we get a toolbox that
905.26	doesn't just count what's easily counted, the tangible in life,
908.26	but actually counts what we most value,
911.26	the things that are intangible.
913.26	I guess I'm sort of a curious CEO.
915.26	I was also a curious economics major as an undergrad.
918.26	I learned that economists measure everything
921.26	in tangible units of production and consumption
924.26	as if each of those tangible units
926.26	is exactly the same.
928.26	They aren't the same.
930.26	In fact, as leaders, what we need to learn
932.26	is that we can influence
934.26	the quality of that unit of production
937.26	by creating the conditions
939.26	for our employees to live their calling.
941.26	In Vivian's case,
943.26	her unit of production
945.26	isn't the tangible hours she works,
947.26	it's the intangible difference she makes
949.26	during that one hour of work.
951.26	This is Dave Arringdale who's actually
953.26	been a longtime guest at Vivian's motel.
955.26	He stayed there a hundred times
957.26	in the last 20 years,
959.26	and he's loyal to the property because of the relationship
962.26	that Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him.
965.26	They've created a habitat of happiness for Dave.
968.26	He tells me that he can always count
971.26	on Vivian and the staff there
973.26	to make him feel at home.
976.26	Why is it that
978.26	business leaders and investors
980.26	quite often don't see the connection
983.26	between creating the intangible
985.26	of employee happiness
987.26	with creating the tangible
989.26	of financial profits in their business?
992.26	We don't have to choose between
994.26	inspired employees and sizable profits,
997.26	we can have both.
999.26	In fact, inspired employees quite often
1001.26	help make sizable profits, right?
1004.26	So what the world needs now,
1006.26	in my opinion,
1008.26	is business leaders and political leaders
1011.26	who know what to count.
1013.26	We count numbers.
1015.26	We count on people.
1018.26	What really counts is when we actually use our numbers
1021.26	to truly take into account our people.
1024.26	I learned that from a maid in a motel
1027.26	and a king of a country.
1029.26	What can you
1031.26	start counting today?
1033.26	What one thing can you start counting today
1036.26	that actually would be meaningful in your life,
1038.26	whether it's your work life or your business life?
1041.26	Thank you very much.
1043.26	(Applause)
