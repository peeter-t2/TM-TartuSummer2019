12.788	You may not realize this,
14.533	but there are more bacteria in your body
14.533	than stars in our entire galaxy.
20.04	This fascinating universe
20.04	of bacteria inside of us
23.167	is an integral part of our health,
25.443	and our technology is evolving so rapidly
27.532	that today we can program these bacteria
27.532	like we program computers.
33.06	Now, the diagram that you see here,
34.939	I know it looks like
34.939	some kind of sports play,
37.47	but it is actually a blueprint of
37.47	the first bacterial program I developed.
41.626	And like writing software,
41.626	we can print and write DNA
44.947	into different algorithms
44.947	and programs inside of bacteria.
48.824	What this program does
48.824	is produces fluorescent proteins
51.519	in a rhythmic fashion
52.957	and generates a small molecule
54.559	that allows bacteria
54.559	to communicate and synchronize,
57.137	as you're seeing in this movie.
59.505	The growing colony of bacteria
59.505	that you see here
61.785	is about the width of a human hair.
63.778	Now, what you can't see
63.778	is that our genetic program
66.285	instructs these bacteria
66.285	to each produce small molecules,
69.768	and these molecules travel between
69.768	the thousands of individual bacteria
73.181	telling them when to turn on and off.
75.897	And the bacteria synchronize
75.897	quite well at this scale,
79.148	but because the molecule that synchronizes
79.148	them together can only travel so fast,
83.142	in larger colonies of bacteria,
83.142	this results in traveling waves
86.718	between bacteria that are
86.718	far away from each other,
89.62	and you can see these waves going
89.62	from right to left across the screen.
93.356	Now, our genetic program
93.356	relies on a natural phenomenon
96.144	called quorum sensing,
97.317	in which bacteria trigger coordinated
97.317	and sometimes virulent behaviors
100.649	once they reach a critical density.
103.59	You can observe quorum sensing
103.59	in action in this movie,
106.245	where a growing colony of bacteria
106.245	only begins to glow
109.887	once it reaches a high
109.887	or critical density.
112.258	Our genetic program
114.1	continues producing these
114.1	rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins
117.251	as the colony grows outwards.
119.619	This particular movie and experiment
119.619	we call The Supernova,
123.31	because it looks like an exploding star.
126.34	Now, besides programming
126.34	these beautiful patterns,
128.73	I wondered, what else can we get
128.73	these bacteria to do?
131.321	And I decided to explore
131.321	how we can program bacteria
133.9	to detect and treat diseases
133.9	in our bodies like cancer.
138.009	One of the surprising facts about bacteria
140.307	is that they can naturally grow
140.307	inside of tumors.
143.744	This happens because typically tumors
145.508	are areas where the immune system
145.508	has no access,
147.923	and so bacteria find these tumors
149.92	and use them as a safe haven
149.92	to grow and thrive.
153.751	We started using probiotic bacteria
155.585	which are safe bacteria
155.585	that have a health benefit,
158.209	and found that
158.209	when orally delivered to mice,
160.67	these probiotics would selectively
160.67	grow inside of liver tumors.
164.826	We realized that the most convenient way
166.78	to highlight the presence
166.78	of the probiotics,
168.861	and hence, the presence of the tumors,
170.724	was to get these bacteria
170.724	to produce a signal
172.953	that would be detectable in the urine,
175.069	and so we specifically
175.069	programmed these probiotics
177.481	to make a molecule that would change
177.481	the color of your urine
180.36	to indicate the presence of cancer.
183.17	We went on to show that this technology
185.18	could sensitively and specifically
185.18	detect liver cancer,
188.37	one that is challenging
188.37	to detect otherwise.
191.891	Now, since these bacteria
191.891	specifically localize to tumors,
194.89	we've been programming them
194.89	to not only detect cancer
197.478	but also to treat cancer
199.266	by producing therapeutic molecules
199.266	from within the tumor environment
202.493	that shrink the existing tumors,
204.815	and we've been doing this
204.815	using quorum sensing programs
207.57	like you saw in the previous movies.
209.413	Altogether, imagine in the future
209.413	taking a programmed probiotic
213.11	that could detect and treat cancer,
215.589	or even other diseases.
218.96	Our ability to program bacteria
220.604	and program life
222.299	opens up new horizons in cancer research,
225.248	and to share this vision,
225.248	I worked with artist Vik Muniz
227.983	to create the symbol of the universe,
229.799	made entirely out of bacteria
229.799	or cancer cells.
233.443	Ultimately, my hope is that the beauty
233.443	and purpose of this microscopic universe
238.645	can inspire new and creative approaches
238.645	for the future of cancer research.
243.544	Thank you.
246.168	(Applause)
