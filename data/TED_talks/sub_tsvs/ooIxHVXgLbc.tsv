12.597	When you're a child,
14.478	anything and everything is possible.
18.147	The challenge, so often,
18.147	is hanging on to that as we grow up.
22.596	And as a four-year-old,
24.181	I had the opportunity
24.181	to sail for the first time.
27.671	I will never forget
27.671	the excitement as we closed the coast.
31.878	I will never forget
33.643	the feeling of adventure
33.643	as I climbed on board the boat
36.638	and stared into her tiny cabin
36.638	for the first time.
40.28	But the most amazing feeling
40.28	was the feeling of freedom,
43.488	the feeling that I felt
43.488	when we hoisted her sails.
47.226	As a four-year-old child,
49.6	it was the greatest sense of freedom
49.6	that I could ever imagine.
53.449	I made my mind up there and then
53.449	that one day, somehow,
56.792	I was going to sail around the world.
60.53	So I did what I could in my life
60.53	to get closer to that dream.
64.36	Age 10, it was saving my school
64.36	dinner money change.
67.426	Every single day for eight years,
67.426	I had mashed potato and baked beans,
71.344	which cost 4p each, and gravy was free.
73.997	Every day I would pile up the change
73.997	on the top of my money box,
77.014	and when that pile reached a pound,
77.014	I would drop it in
79.604	and cross off one of the 100 squares
79.604	I'd drawn on a piece of paper.
84.167	Finally, I bought a tiny dinghy.
87.418	I spent hours sitting on it in the garden
87.418	dreaming of my goal.
91.381	I read every book I could on sailing,
94.5	and then eventually,
94.5	having been told by my school
97.495	I wasn't clever enough to be a vet,
99.771	left school age 17 to begin
99.771	my apprenticeship in sailing.
104.739	So imagine how it felt
104.739	just four years later
108.83	to be sitting in a boardroom
110.506	in front of someone who I knew
110.506	could make that dream come true.
114.895	I felt like my life
114.895	depended on that moment,
118.003	and incredibly, he said yes.
120.644	And I could barely contain my excitement
120.644	as I sat in that first design meeting
124.754	designing a boat
124.754	on which I was going to sail
127.564	solo nonstop around the world.
130.443	From that first meeting
130.443	to the finish line of the race,
133.299	it was everything I'd ever imagined.
135.597	Just like in my dreams, there were
135.597	amazing parts and tough parts.
139.498	We missed an iceberg by 20 feet.
141.658	Nine times, I climbed to the top
141.658	of her 90-foot mast.
144.931	We were blown on our side
144.931	in the Southern Ocean.
147.3	But the sunsets, the wildlife,
147.3	and the remoteness
150.272	were absolutely breathtaking.
153.857	After three months at sea, age just 24,
156.504	I finished in second position.
159.359	I'd loved it, so much so
159.359	that within six months
162.75	I decided to go around the world again,
162.75	but this time not in a race:
167.326	to try to be the fastest person ever
167.326	to sail solo nonstop around the world.
172.789	Now for this, I needed a different craft:
175.65	bigger, wider, faster, more powerful.
179.244	Just to give that boat some scale,
179.244	I could climb inside her mast
182.959	all the way to the top.
184.863	Seventy-five foot long, 60 foot wide.
188.253	I affectionately called her Moby.
190.552	She was a multihull.
192.311	When we built her, no one had ever
192.311	made it solo nonstop
195.892	around the world in one,
195.892	though many had tried,
198.191	but whilst we built her, a Frenchman
198.191	took a boat 25 percent bigger than her
203.063	and not only did he make it,
203.063	but he took the record from 93 days
206.852	right down to 72.
209.568	The bar was now much, much higher.
212.155	And these boats were exciting to sail.
214.105	This was a training sail
214.105	off the French coast.
217.472	This I know well because I was one
217.472	of the five crew members on board.
221.187	Five seconds is all it took
221.187	from everything being fine
225.538	to our world going black
225.538	as the windows were thrust underwater,
228.617	and that five seconds goes quickly.
230.776	Just see how far below
230.776	those guys the sea is.
233.679	Imagine that alone
233.679	in the Southern Ocean
237.792	plunged into icy water,
237.792	thousands of miles away from land.
243.27	It was Christmas Day.
245.56	I was forging into the Southern Ocean
245.56	underneath Australia.
248.933	The conditions were horrendous.
251.55	I was approaching a part in the ocean
253.531	which was 2,000 miles away
253.531	from the nearest town.
257.432	The nearest land was Antarctica,
257.432	and the nearest people
260.311	would be those manning
260.311	the European Space Station above me.
263.18	(Laughter)
264.56	You really are in the middle of nowhere.
267.369	If you need help,
269.18	and you're still alive,
270.736	it takes four days
270.736	for a ship to get to you
273.731	and then four days for that ship
273.731	to get you back to port.
277.145	No helicopter can reach you out there,
279.466	and no plane can land.
281.31	We are forging ahead of a huge storm.
284.944	Within it, there was 80 knots of wind,
287.37	which was far too much wind
287.37	for the boat and I to cope with.
290.296	The waves were already 40 to 50 feet high,
293.337	and the spray from the breaking crests
295.427	was blown horizontally
295.427	like snow in a blizzard.
298.492	If we didn't sail fast enough,
298.492	we'd be engulfed by that storm,
302.37	and either capsized or smashed to pieces.
305.527	We were quite literally
305.527	hanging on for our lives
308.314	and doing so on a knife edge.
311.518	The speed I so desperately needed
311.518	brought with it danger.
315.351	We all know what it's like driving a car
319.575	It's not too stressful.
319.575	We can concentrate.
322.454	We can turn on the radio.
324.242	Take that 50, 60, 70, accelerate through
324.242	to 80, 90, 100 miles an hour.
328.7	Now you have white knuckles
328.7	and you're gripping the steering wheel.
331.974	Now take that car off road at night
334.537	and remove the windscreen wipers,
334.537	the windscreen,
336.873	the headlights and the brakes.
338.498	That's what it's like
338.498	in the Southern Ocean.
340.704	(Laughter) (Applause)
345.172	You could imagine
346.041	it would be quite difficult
346.041	to sleep in that situation,
348.831	even as a passenger.
350.781	But you're not a passenger.
352.306	You're alone on a boat
352.306	you can barely stand up in,
354.705	and you have to make
354.705	every single decision on board.
357.213	I was absolutely exhausted,
357.213	physically and mentally.
360.487	Eight sail changes in 12 hours.
362.6	The mainsail weighed
362.6	three times my body weight,
365.13	and after each change,
366.827	I would collapse on the floor
366.827	soaked with sweat
369.124	with this freezing Southern Ocean air
369.124	burning the back of my throat.
373.721	But out there, those lowest of the lows
376.276	are so often contrasted
376.276	with the highest of the highs.
379.596	A few days later, we came out
379.596	of the back of the low.
383.659	Against all odds, we'd been able
383.659	to drive ahead of the record
387.397	within that depression.
389.464	The sky cleared, the rain stopped,
392.25	and our heartbeat, the monstrous
392.25	seas around us were transformed
396.569	into the most beautiful moonlit mountains.
400.168	It's hard to explain, but you enter
400.168	a different mode when you head out there.
404.765	Your boat is your entire world,
406.75	and what you take with you
406.75	when you leave is all you have.
409.595	If I said to you all now,
409.595	"""Go off into Vancouver"
412.612	and find everything you will need for
412.612	"your survival for the next three months,"""
416.348	that's quite a task.
418.116	That's food, fuel, clothes,
420.554	even toilet roll and toothpaste.
422.969	That's what we do,
424.432	and when we leave we manage it
426.336	down to the last drop of diesel
426.336	and the last packet of food.
430	No experience in my life
431.833	could have given me a better understanding
431.833	"of the definition of the word ""finite."""
435.74	What we have out there is all we have.
437.852	There is no more.
439.571	And never in my life had I ever
439.571	translated that definition of finite
442.891	that I'd felt on board
442.891	to anything outside of sailing
446.211	until I stepped off the boat at
446.211	the finish line having broken that record.
450.809	(Applause)
456.265	Suddenly I connected the dots.
458.935	Our global economy is no different.
461.774	It's entirely dependent
461.774	on finite materials
464.276	we only have once
464.276	in the history of humanity.
466.864	And it was a bit like seeing something
466.864	you weren't expecting under a stone
470.638	and having two choices:
472.147	I either put that stone to one side
474.701	and learn more about it,
474.701	or I put that stone back
478.114	and I carry on with my dream job
478.114	of sailing around the world.
482.526	I chose the first.
484.128	I put it to one side and I began
484.128	a new journey of learning,
487.611	speaking to chief executives,
487.611	experts, scientists, economists
491.117	to try to understand just how
491.117	our global economy works.
494.739	And my curiosity took me
494.739	to some extraordinary places.
498.431	This photo was taken in the burner
498.431	of a coal-fired power station.
503.183	I was fascinated by coal,
503.183	fundamental to our global energy needs,
506.317	but also very close to my family.
509.274	My great-grandfather was a coal miner,
511.28	and he spent 50 years
511.28	of his life underground.
515.52	This is a photo of him,
515.52	and when you see that photo,
518.315	you see someone from another era.
520.8	No one wears trousers
520.8	with a waistband quite that high
523.818	in this day and age. (Laughter)
526.303	But yet, that's me
526.303	with my great-grandfather,
528.973	and by the way, they are not
528.973	his real ears. (Laughter)
533.106	We were close. I remember sitting on
533.106	his knee listening to his mining stories.
537.564	He talked of the camaraderie underground,
539.816	and the fact that the miners used to save
539.816	the crusts of their sandwiches
543.253	to give to the ponies
543.253	they worked with underground.
546.341	It was like it was yesterday.
548.732	And on my journey of learning,
550.52	I went to the World
550.52	Coal Association website,
552.842	and there in the middle
552.842	of the homepage, it said,
555.164	"""We have about 118 years of coal left."""
558.322	And I thought to myself, well,
558.322	that's well outside my lifetime,
561.456	and a much greater figure
561.456	than the predictions for oil.
564.335	But I did the math, and I realized
564.335	that my great-grandfather
567.4	had been born exactly 118 years
567.4	before that year,
571.974	and I sat on his knee
571.974	until I was 11 years old,
574.737	and I realized it's nothing
576.641	in time, nor in history.
578.963	And it made me make a decision
578.963	I never thought I would make:
582.121	to leave the sport
582.121	of solo sailing behind me
584.466	and focus on the greatest challenge
584.466	I'd ever come across:
587.531	the future of our global economy.
589.861	And I quickly realized it wasn't
589.861	just about energy.
592.57	It was also materials.
594.613	In 2008, I picked up a scientific study
596.772	looking at how many years we have
598.816	of valuable materials
598.816	to extract from the ground:
601.532	copper, 61; tin, zinc, 40; silver, 29.
605.921	These figures couldn't be exact,
605.921	but we knew those materials were finite.
609.937	We only have them once.
611.674	And yet, our speed that we've used
611.674	these materials has increased rapidly,
615.208	exponentially.
616.95	With more people in the world
616.95	with more stuff,
619.806	we've effectively seen
622.58	in those basic commodities
622.58	erased in just 10 years.
625.425	And this affects all of us.
627.212	It's brought huge volatility in prices,
629.232	so much so that in 2011,
632.081	your average European car manufacturer
634.619	saw a raw material price increase
637.173	of 500 million Euros,
639.379	wiping away half their operating profits
641.701	through something they have
641.701	absolutely no control over.
645.26	And the more I learned, the more
645.26	I started to change my own life.
648.56	I started traveling less,
648.56	doing less, using less.
650.849	It felt like actually doing less
650.849	was what we had to do.
654.39	But it sat uneasy with me.
656.74	It didn't feel right.
657.862	It felt like we were
657.862	buying ourselves time.
660.358	We were eking things out a bit longer.
662.25	Even if everybody changed,
662.25	it wouldn't solve the problem.
665.477	It wouldn't fix the system.
667.521	It was vital in the transition,
667.521	but what fascinated me was,
670.562	in the transition to what?
670.562	What could actually work?
674.951	It struck me that the system itself,
674.951	the framework within which we live,
679.246	is fundamentally flawed,
681.545	and I realized ultimately
684.804	that our operating system,
684.804	the way our economy functions,
687.837	the way our economy's been built,
687.837	is a system in itself.
691.32	At sea, I had to understand
691.32	complex systems.
694.222	I had to take multiple inputs,
696.1	I had to process them,
697.612	and I had to understand the system to win.
700.5	I had to make sense of it.
702.233	And as I looked at our global economy,
702.233	I realized it too is that system,
706.296	but it's a system that effectively
706.296	can't run in the long term.
710.708	And I realized we've been perfecting
710.708	what's effectively a linear economy
714.469	for 150 years,
716.339	where we take a material
716.339	out of the ground,
718.37	we make something out of it,
718.37	and then ultimately
720.878	that product gets thrown away,
720.878	and yes, we do recycle some of it,
724.152	but more an attempt to get out
724.152	what we can at the end,
727.147	not by design.
729.353	It's an economy that fundamentally
729.353	can't run in the long term,
732.557	and if we know that we
732.557	have finite materials,
735.59	why would we build an economy
735.59	that would effectively use things up,
738.919	that would create waste?
740.777	Life itself has existed
740.777	for billions of years
743.702	and has continually adapted
743.702	to use materials effectively.
747.324	It's a complex system,
747.324	but within it, there is no waste.
750.645	Everything is metabolized.
753.244	It's not a linear economy
753.244	at all, but circular.
757.934	And I felt like the child in the garden.
760.931	For the first time on this new journey,
760.931	I could see exactly where we were headed.
765.598	If we could build an economy that would
765.598	use things rather than use them up,
769.382	we could build a future that really
769.382	could work in the long term.
772.61	I was excited.
774.514	This was something to work towards.
776.673	We knew exactly where we were headed.
776.673	We just had to work out how to get there,
780.45	and it was exactly with this in mind
782.38	that we created the Ellen MacArthur
782.38	Foundation in September 2010.
787.485	Many schools of thought fed our thinking
787.485	and pointed to this model:
791.348	industrial symbiosis, performance economy,
791.348	sharing economy, biomimicry,
795.968	and of course, cradle-to-cradle design.
798.894	Materials would be defined
798.894	as either technical or biological,
802.579	waste would be designed out entirely,
805.6	and we would have a system
805.6	that could function
808.112	absolutely in the long term.
810.294	So what could this economy look like?
813.151	Maybe we wouldn't buy light fittings,
813.151	but we'd pay for the service of light,
817.089	and the manufacturers
817.089	would recover the materials
819.532	and change the light fittings
819.532	when we had more efficient products.
822.693	What if packaging was so nontoxic
822.693	it could dissolve in water
825.99	and we could ultimately drink it?
825.99	It would never become waste.
829.102	What if engines were re-manufacturable,
831.215	and we could recover
831.215	the component materials
833.49	and significantly reduce energy demand.
835.72	What if we could recover components
835.72	from circuit boards, reutilize them,
839.16	and then fundamentally recover
839.16	the materials within them
841.823	through a second stage?
843.225	What if we could collect
843.225	food waste, human waste?
845.517	What if we could turn that
845.517	into fertilizer, heat, energy,
848.698	ultimately reconnecting nutrients systems
851.694	and rebuilding natural capital?
854.805	And cars -- what we want
854.805	is to move around.
857.707	We don't need to own
857.707	the materials within them.
860.35	Could cars become a service
861.989	and provide us with
861.989	mobility in the future?
865.033	All of this sounds amazing, but these
865.033	aren't just ideas, they're real today,
869.23	and these lie at the forefront
869.23	of the circular economy.
871.95	What lies before us is to expand them
871.95	and scale them up.
876.454	So how would you shift
876.454	from linear to circular?
879.899	Well, the team and I at the foundation
879.899	thought you might want to work
883.195	with the top universities in the world,
885.069	with leading businesses within the world,
887.089	with the biggest convening
887.089	platforms in the world,
889.437	and with governments.
890.439	We thought you might want
890.439	to work with the best analysts
893.059	and ask them the question,
894.313	"""Can the circular economy decouple"
894.313	growth from resource constraints?
897.514	Is the circular economy able
897.514	to rebuild natural capital?
901.136	Could the circular economy
901.136	"replace current chemical fertilizer use?"""
904.781	Yes was the answer to the decoupling,
907.127	but also yes, we could replace
907.127	current fertilizer use
910.145	by a staggering 2.7 times.
914.69	But what inspired me most
914.69	about the circular economy
917.25	was its ability to inspire young people.
920.779	When young people see the economy
920.779	through a circular lens,
923.914	they see brand new opportunities
923.914	on exactly the same horizon.
928.488	They can use their creativity
928.488	and knowledge
931.093	to rebuild the entire system,
933.48	and it's there for the taking right now,
935.593	and the faster we do this, the better.
938.049	So could we achieve this
938.049	in their lifetimes?
941.119	Is it actually possible?
943.255	I believe yes.
945.105	When you look at the lifetime of
945.105	my great-grandfather, anything's possible.
949.574	When he was born, there were only
953.31	they had only just been invented.
955.74	When he was 14, we flew
955.74	for the first time in history.
959.671	Now there are 100,000 charter flights
962.16	every single day.
964.106	When he was 45, we built
964.106	the first computer.
968.1	Many said it wouldn't catch on,
968.1	but it did, and just 20 years later
971.257	we turned it into a microchip
973.278	of which there will be thousands
973.278	in this room here today.
977.48	Ten years before he died,
977.48	we built the first mobile phone.
980.359	It wasn't that mobile, to be fair,
982.333	but now it really is,
984.307	and as my great-grandfather
984.307	left this Earth, the Internet arrived.
988.277	Now we can do anything,
990.39	but more importantly,
991.67	now we have a plan.
993.985	Thank you.
