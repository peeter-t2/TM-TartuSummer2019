16.26	How do you explain
16.26	when things don't go as we assume?
20.26	Or better, how do you explain
23.26	when others are able to achieve things
23.26	that seem to defy all of the assumptions?
27.26	For example:
29.26	Why is Apple so innovative?
31.26	Year after year, after year,
33.26	they're more innovative
33.26	than all their competition.
36.26	And yet, they're just a computer company.
38.26	They're just like everyone else.
40.26	They have the same access
40.26	to the same talent,
42.474	the same agencies,
43.499	the same consultants, the same media.
45.379	Then why is it that they seem
45.379	to have something different?
50.26	Why is it that Martin Luther King
50.26	led the Civil Rights Movement?
54.26	He wasn't the only man
54.26	who suffered in pre-civil rights America,
58.26	and he certainly wasn't
58.26	the only great orator of the day.
61.029	Why him?
62.26	And why is it that the Wright brothers
65.26	were able to figure out controlled,
65.26	powered man flight
68.26	when there were certainly other teams
70.434	who were better qualified,
70.434	better funded --
73.331	and they didn't achieve
73.331	powered man flight,
76.26	and the Wright brothers beat them to it.
78.259	There's something else at play here.
81.385	About three and a half years ago,
81.385	I made a discovery.
85.26	And this discovery profoundly changed
85.26	my view on how I thought the world worked,
91.26	and it even profoundly changed the way
91.26	in which I operate in it.
97.26	As it turns out, there's a pattern.
100.26	As it turns out, all the great inspiring
100.26	leaders and organizations in the world,
104.26	whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King
104.26	or the Wright brothers,
107.299	they all think, act and communicate
107.299	the exact same way.
111.26	And it's the complete opposite
111.26	to everyone else.
115.26	All I did was codify it,
117.26	and it's probably
117.26	the world's simplest idea.
121.26	I call it the golden circle.
131.556	Why? How? What?
134.26	This little idea explains
136.26	why some organizations and some leaders
136.26	are able to inspire where others aren't.
140.26	Let me define the terms really quickly.
142.26	Every single person, every single
142.26	organization on the planet
145.26	knows what they do, 100 percent.
149.26	Some know how they do it,
151.26	whether you call it
151.26	your differentiated value proposition
153.968	or your proprietary process or your USP.
156.26	But very, very few people or organizations
156.26	know why they do what they do.
161.031	"And by ""why"" I don't mean"
161.031	"""to make a profit."""
163.26	That's a result. It's always a result.
165.26	"By ""why,"" I mean: What's your purpose?"
167.26	What's your cause? What's your belief?
169.723	Why does your organization exist?
173.26	Why do you get out of bed in the morning?
175.652	And why should anyone care?
178.26	As a result, the way we think, we act,
180.189	the way we communicate
180.189	is from the outside in, it's obvious.
183.029	We go from the clearest thing
183.029	to the fuzziest thing.
185.744	But the inspired leaders
185.744	and the inspired organizations --
189.26	regardless of their size,
189.26	regardless of their industry --
192.879	all think, act and communicate
192.879	from the inside out.
197.807	Let me give you an example.
199.26	I use Apple because they're easy
199.26	to understand and everybody gets it.
202.672	If Apple were like everyone else,
205.267	a marketing message from them
205.267	might sound like this:
208.771	"""We make great computers."
211.26	They're beautifully designed,
211.26	simple to use and user friendly.
215.26	"Want to buy one?"""
217.454	"""Meh."""
218.479	That's how most of us communicate.
220.26	That's how most marketing
220.26	and sales are done,
222.772	that's how we communicate interpersonally.
224.891	We say what we do,
226.686	we say how we're different or better
228.479	and we expect some sort of a behavior,
230.36	a purchase, a vote, something like that.
232.36	Here's our new law firm:
233.66	We have the best lawyers
233.66	with the biggest clients,
236.106	we always perform for our clients.
237.752	Here's our new car:
239.26	It gets great gas mileage,
239.26	it has leather seats.
241.916	Buy our car.
243.129	But it's uninspiring.
244.26	Here's how Apple actually communicates.
248.26	"""Everything we do,"
248.26	we believe in challenging the status quo.
253.26	We believe in thinking differently.
256.93	The way we challenge the status quo
258.715	is by making our products
258.715	beautifully designed,
261.26	simple to use and user friendly.
263.26	We just happen to make great computers.
265.923	"Want to buy one?"""
268.152	Totally different, right?
269.479	You're ready to buy a computer from me.
271.46	I just reversed
271.46	the order of the information.
273.682	What it proves to us is
273.682	that people don't buy what you do;
277.578	people buy why you do it.
280.007	This explains why
280.007	every single person in this room
284.26	is perfectly comfortable buying
284.26	a computer from Apple.
287.26	But we're also perfectly comfortable
289.26	buying an MP3 player from Apple,
289.26	or a phone from Apple,
292.26	or a DVR from Apple.
294.261	As I said before,
294.261	Apple's just a computer company.
296.812	Nothing distinguishes them structurally
296.812	from any of their competitors.
300.26	Their competitors are equally qualified
300.26	to make all of these products.
303.732	In fact, they tried.
305.26	A few years ago, Gateway
305.26	came out with flat-screen TVs.
308.26	They're eminently qualified
308.26	to make flat-screen TVs.
310.713	They've been making
310.713	flat-screen monitors for years.
313.26	Nobody bought one.
317.917	Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs,
323.26	and they make great quality products,
325.26	and they can make perfectly
325.26	well-designed products --
328.26	and nobody bought one.
330.084	In fact, talking about it now,
330.084	we can't even imagine
332.56	buying an MP3 player from Dell.
334.132	Why would you buy one
334.132	from a computer company?
336.36	But we do it every day.
337.981	People don't buy what you do;
337.981	they buy why you do it.
340.496	The goal is not to do business
340.496	with everybody who needs what you have.
346.045	The goal is to do business with people
346.045	who believe what you believe.
351.26	Here's the best part:
352.911	None of what I'm telling you
352.911	is my opinion.
355.26	It's all grounded
355.26	in the tenets of biology.
358.26	Not psychology, biology.
360.26	If you look at a cross-section
360.26	of the human brain,
363.023	from the top down,
363.023	the human brain is actually broken
365.68	into three major components
367.26	that correlate perfectly
367.26	with the golden circle.
370.26	Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain,
373.26	our neocortex,
375.26	"corresponds with the ""what"" level."
377.26	The neocortex is responsible
379.26	for all of our rational
379.26	and analytical thought and language.
383.26	The middle two sections make up
383.26	our limbic brains,
386.26	and our limbic brains are responsible
386.26	for all of our feelings,
389.26	like trust and loyalty.
392.26	It's also responsible
392.26	for all human behavior,
394.427	all decision-making,
396.26	and it has no capacity for language.
399.26	In other words, when we communicate
399.26	from the outside in,
402.26	yes, people can understand vast
402.26	amounts of complicated information
405.427	like features and benefits
405.427	and facts and figures.
408.26	It just doesn't drive behavior.
410.26	When we can communicate
410.26	from the inside out,
412.38	we're talking directly
412.38	to the part of the brain
414.643	that controls behavior,
416.26	and then we allow people to rationalize it
416.26	with the tangible things we say and do.
420.26	This is where gut decisions come from.
422.834	Sometimes you can give somebody
422.834	all the facts and figures,
426.26	"and they say, ""I know"
426.26	what all the facts and details say,
429.006	"but it just doesn't feel right."""
430.56	Why would we use that verb,
430.56	"it doesn't ""feel"" right?"
433.124	Because the part of the brain
433.124	that controls decision-making
435.923	doesn't control language.
437.26	The best we can muster up is,
438.745	"""I don't know. "
438.745	"It just doesn't feel right."""
440.822	Or sometimes you say you're leading
440.822	with your heart or soul.
444.26	I hate to break it to you,
444.26	those aren't other body parts
446.956	controlling your behavior.
448.26	It's all happening here
448.26	in your limbic brain,
450.427	the part of the brain that controls
450.427	decision-making and not language.
453.737	But if you don't know
453.737	why you do what you do,
456.26	and people respond
456.26	to why you do what you do,
459.26	then how will you ever get people
462.26	to vote for you,
462.26	or buy something from you,
464.332	or, more importantly, be loyal
466.26	and want to be a part
466.26	of what it is that you do.
469.26	The goal is not just to sell
469.26	to people who need what you have;
472.334	the goal is to sell to people
472.334	who believe what you believe.
475.26	The goal is not just
475.26	to hire people who need a job;
479.26	it's to hire people
479.26	who believe what you believe.
482.26	I always say that, you know,
484.404	if you hire people just because they can
484.404	do a job, they'll work for your money,
490.26	but if they believe what you believe,
492.075	they'll work for you with blood
492.075	and sweat and tears.
494.534	Nowhere else is there a better example
494.534	than with the Wright brothers.
498.26	Most people don't know
498.26	about Samuel Pierpont Langley.
501.898	And back in the early 20th century,
504.26	the pursuit of powered man flight
504.26	was like the dot com of the day.
507.427	Everybody was trying it.
509.26	And Samuel Pierpont Langley
509.26	had, what we assume,
512.26	to be the recipe for success.
514.957	Even now, you ask people,
516.68	"""Why did your product"
516.68	"or why did your company fail?"""
519.323	and people always give
519.323	you the same permutation
521.608	of the same three things:
523.053	under-capitalized, the wrong people,
523.053	bad market conditions.
526.054	It's always the same three things,
526.054	so let's explore that.
529.682	Samuel Pierpont Langley
531.26	was given 50,000 dollars
531.26	by the War Department
534.26	to figure out this flying machine.
536.26	Money was no problem.
537.855	He held a seat at Harvard
540.26	and worked at the Smithsonian
540.26	and was extremely well-connected;
543.284	he knew all the big minds of the day.
545.26	He hired the best minds money could find
549.26	and the market conditions were fantastic.
551.26	The New York Times
551.26	followed him around everywhere,
554.26	and everyone was rooting for Langley.
556.26	Then how come we've never heard
556.26	of Samuel Pierpont Langley?
559.745	A few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio,
562.839	Orville and Wilbur Wright,
564.26	they had none of what we consider
564.26	to be the recipe for success.
568.26	They had no money;
570.26	they paid for their dream
570.26	with the proceeds from their bicycle shop.
573.523	Not a single person
573.523	on the Wright brothers' team
575.833	had a college education,
577.26	not even Orville or Wilbur.
579.26	And The New York Times
579.26	followed them around nowhere.
582.26	The difference was,
584.26	Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause,
584.26	by a purpose, by a belief.
588.26	They believed that if they could
588.26	figure out this flying machine,
592.26	it'll change the course of the world.
595.644	Samuel Pierpont Langley was different.
597.617	He wanted to be rich,
597.617	and he wanted to be famous.
600.26	He was in pursuit of the result.
602.26	He was in pursuit of the riches.
604.26	And lo and behold, look what happened.
606.238	The people who believed
606.238	in the Wright brothers' dream
609.808	worked with them with blood
609.808	and sweat and tears.
612.26	The others just worked for the paycheck.
614.26	They tell stories of how every time
614.26	the Wright brothers went out,
617.479	they would have to take
617.479	five sets of parts,
619.51	because that's how many times
619.51	they would crash before supper.
623.926	And, eventually, on December 17th, 1903,
627.967	the Wright brothers took flight,
630.26	and no one was there
630.26	to even experience it.
632.332	We found out about it a few days later.
636.014	And further proof that Langley
636.014	was motivated by the wrong thing:
640.061	the day the Wright brothers took flight,
642.419	he quit.
643.444	He could have said,
645.26	"""That's an amazing discovery, guys,"
647.26	and I will improve
647.26	"upon your technology,"" but he didn't."
650.26	He wasn't first, he didn't get rich,
650.26	he didn't get famous, so he quit.
654.97	People don't buy what you do;
654.97	they buy why you do it.
657.494	If you talk about what you believe,
659.26	you will attract those
659.26	who believe what you believe.
662.26	But why is it important to attract
662.26	those who believe what you believe?
667.664	Something called the law
667.664	of diffusion of innovation,
670.241	if you don't know the law,
670.241	you know the terminology.
672.775	The first 2.5% of our population
672.775	are our innovators.
677.26	The next 13.5% of our population
677.26	are our early adopters.
682.512	The next 34% are your early majority,
684.38	your late majority and your laggards.
687.705	The only reason these people
687.705	buy touch-tone phones
690.26	is because you can't buy
690.26	rotary phones anymore.
692.523	(Laughter)
694.26	We all sit at various places
694.26	at various times on this scale,
697.26	but what the law of diffusion
697.26	of innovation tells us
700.26	is that if you want mass-market success
700.26	or mass-market acceptance of an idea,
705.26	you cannot have it
705.26	until you achieve this tipping point
709.26	between 15 and 18 percent
709.26	market penetration,
712.26	and then the system tips.
715.26	I love asking businesses,
715.26	"""What's your conversion on new business?"""
718.529	They love to tell you,
718.529	"""It's about 10 percent,"" proudly."
721.186	Well, you can trip
721.186	over 10% of the customers.
723.353	"We all have about 10% who just ""get it."""
725.323	That's how we describe them, right?
727.06	That's like that gut feeling,
727.06	"""Oh, they just get it."""
729.561	The problem is: How do you
729.561	find the ones that get it
732.021	before doing business
732.021	versus the ones who don't get it?
734.689	So it's this here, this little gap
734.689	that you have to close,
738.26	as Jeffrey Moore calls it,
738.26	"""Crossing the Chasm"" --"
740.665	because, you see, the early majority
740.665	will not try something
744.26	until someone else has tried it first.
748.26	And these guys, the innovators
748.26	and the early adopters,
751.26	they're comfortable
751.26	making those gut decisions.
753.475	They're more comfortable
753.475	making those intuitive decisions
756.26	that are driven by what
756.26	they believe about the world
760.26	and not just what product is available.
762.26	These are the people who stood
762.26	in line for six hours
764.931	to buy an iPhone when they first came out,
767.091	when you could have bought one
767.091	off the shelf the next week.
770.26	These are the people
770.26	who spent 40,000 dollars
772.427	on flat-screen TVs
772.427	when they first came out,
775.26	even though the technology
775.26	was substandard.
778.26	And, by the way, they didn't do it
778.26	because the technology was so great;
782.26	they did it for themselves.
784.26	It's because they wanted to be first.
786.26	People don't buy what you do;
786.26	they buy why you do it
788.761	and what you do simply proves
788.761	what you believe.
792.26	In fact, people will do the things
792.26	that prove what they believe.
796.26	The reason that person bought the iPhone
796.26	in the first six hours,
801.26	stood in line for six hours,
803.26	was because of what they believed
803.26	about the world,
805.665	and how they wanted everybody to see them:
807.689	they were first.
808.745	People don't buy what you do;
808.745	they buy why you do it.
811.26	So let me give you a famous example,
813.26	a famous failure and a famous success
813.26	of the law of diffusion of innovation.
817.847	First, the famous failure.
819.26	It's a commercial example.
821.26	As we said before, the recipe for success
823.521	is money and the right people
823.521	and the right market conditions.
826.937	You should have success then.
828.706	Look at TiVo.
830.26	From the time TiVo came out
830.26	about eight or nine years ago
832.999	to this current day,
834.261	they are the single highest-quality
834.261	product on the market,
837.935	hands down, there is no dispute.
840.855	They were extremely well-funded.
842.686	Market conditions were fantastic.
844.409	I mean, we use TiVo as verb.
846.26	I TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junk
846.26	Time Warner DVR all the time.
849.543	(Laughter)
852.059	But TiVo's a commercial failure.
854.26	They've never made money.
856.26	And when they went IPO,
858.26	their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars
860.26	and then plummeted,
860.26	and it's never traded above 10.
862.713	In fact, I don't think
862.713	it's even traded above six,
865.26	except for a couple of little spikes.
867.26	Because you see, when TiVo
867.26	launched their product,
869.618	they told us all what they had.
872.26	"They said, ""We have a product"
872.26	that pauses live TV,
875.738	skips commercials, rewinds live TV
875.738	and memorizes your viewing habits
880.26	"without you even asking."""
883.435	And the cynical majority said,
885.26	"""We don't believe you."
887.26	We don't need it. We don't like it.
889.832	"You're scaring us."""
891.951	What if they had said,
893.26	"""If you're the kind of person"
893.26	who likes to have total control
898.26	over every aspect of your life,
901.26	boy, do we have a product for you.
904.26	It pauses live TV, skips commercials,
906.262	"memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc."""
909.118	People don't buy what you do;
909.118	they buy why you do it,
911.656	and what you do simply serves
911.656	as the proof of what you believe.
915.819	Now let me give you a successful example
915.819	of the law of diffusion of innovation.
921.26	In the summer of 1963,
	on the mall in Washington
928.26	to hear Dr. King speak.
931.414	They sent out no invitations,
934.26	and there was no website
934.26	to check the date.
937.26	How do you do that?
939.26	Well, Dr. King
939.26	wasn't the only man in America
941.427	who was a great orator.
943.854	He wasn't the only man
943.854	in America who suffered
946.044	in a pre-civil rights America.
947.846	In fact, some of his ideas were bad.
950.26	But he had a gift.
952.22	He didn't go around telling people
952.22	what needed to change in America.
955.515	He went around
955.515	and told people what he believed.
957.856	"""I believe, I believe, I believe,"""
957.856	he told people.
961.26	And people who believed what he believed
963.815	took his cause, and they made it
963.815	their own, and they told people.
967.26	And some of those people
967.26	created structures
969.332	to get the word out to even more people.
971.851	And lo and behold,
975.26	on the right day at the right time
975.26	to hear him speak.
980.26	How many of them showed up for him?
984.579	Zero.
986.26	They showed up for themselves.
988.26	It's what they believed about America
990.986	that got them to travel
990.986	in a bus for eight hours
993.26	to stand in the sun in Washington
993.26	in the middle of August.
996.26	It's what they believed,
996.26	and it wasn't about black versus white:
1002.657	Dr. King believed that there are
1002.657	two types of laws in this world:
1006.284	those that are made by a higher authority
1006.284	and those that are made by men.
1010.26	And not until all the laws
1010.26	that are made by men
1013.26	are consistent with the laws
1013.26	made by the higher authority
1016.077	will we live in a just world.
1018.037	It just so happened
1018.037	that the Civil Rights Movement
1020.476	was the perfect thing to help him
1020.476	bring his cause to life.
1024.26	We followed, not for him,
1024.26	but for ourselves.
1027.26	By the way, he gave
1027.26	"the ""I have a dream"" speech,"
1029.585	"not the ""I have a plan"" speech."
1031.594	(Laughter)
1035.26	Listen to politicians now,
1035.26	with their comprehensive 12-point plans.
1038.475	They're not inspiring anybody.
1040.26	Because there are leaders
1040.26	and there are those who lead.
1043.26	Leaders hold a position
1043.26	of power or authority,
1047.26	but those who lead inspire us.
1051.793	Whether they're individuals
1051.793	or organizations,
1054.168	we follow those who lead,
1054.168	not because we have to,
1057.26	but because we want to.
1060.045	We follow those who lead, not for them,
1060.045	but for ourselves.
1065.744	"And it's those who start with ""why"""
1068.26	that have the ability
1068.26	to inspire those around them
1073.024	or find others who inspire them.
1076.476	Thank you very much.
1077.664	(Applause)
