12.76	When I was six years old,
14.4	I received my gifts.
16.32	My first grade teacher
16.32	had this brilliant idea.
19.8	She wanted us to experience
19.8	receiving gifts
23.16	but also learning the virtue
23.16	of complimenting each other.
27.64	So she had all of us
27.64	come to the front of the classroom,
30.56	and she bought all of us gifts
30.56	and stacked them in the corner.
33.56	And she said,
34.8	"""Why don't we just stand here"
34.8	and compliment each other?
37.48	If you hear your name called,
39.08	"go and pick up your gift and sit down."""
42.52	What a wonderful idea, right?
44.88	What could go wrong?
46.12	(Laughter)
48.4	Well, there were 40 of us to start with,
50.48	and every time I heard
50.48	someone's name called,
52.96	I would give out the heartiest cheer.
55.28	And then there were 20 people left,
57.8	and 10 people left,
59.6	and five left ...
61.56	and three left.
62.96	And I was one of them.
64.72	And the compliments stopped.
67.56	Well, at that moment, I was crying.
70.6	And the teacher was freaking out.
72.64	"She was like, ""Hey, would anyone"
72.64	"say anything nice about these people?"""
76.319	(Laughter)
77.56	"""No one? OK, why don't you"
77.56	go get your gift and sit down.
80.56	So behave next year --
81.84	someone might say
81.84	"something nice about you."""
83.96	(Laughter)
86.52	Well, as I'm describing this you,
88.16	you probably know
88.16	I remember this really well.
90.56	(Laughter)
92.8	But I don't know who felt worse that day.
94.92	Was it me or the teacher?
97.12	She must have realized
97.12	that she turned a team-building event
100.28	into a public roast
100.28	for three six-year-olds.
103.8	And without the humor.
105.08	You know, when you see
105.08	people get roasted on TV,
107.44	it was funny.
108.68	There was nothing funny about that day.
111.32	So that was one version of me,
114.36	and I would die to avoid
114.36	being in that situation again --
117.88	to get rejected in public again.
120.44	That's one version.
121.92	Then fast-forward eight years.
124.4	Bill Gates came to my hometown --
126.4	Beijing, China --
127.64	to speak,
128.88	and I saw his message.
130.64	I fell in love with that guy.
132.96	I thought, wow,
132.96	I know what I want to do now.
135.88	That night I wrote a letter to my family
138.04	"telling them: ""By age 25,"
140.36	I will build the biggest
140.36	company in the world,
143	"and that company will buy Microsoft."""
144.96	(Laughter)
146.88	I totally embraced this idea
146.88	of conquering the world --
149.52	domination, right?
151.16	And I didn't make this up,
151.16	I did write that letter.
154	And here it is --
155.36	(Laughter)
157.36	You don't have to read this through --
159.2	(Laughter)
161	This is also bad handwriting,
161	but I did highlight some key words.
165.6	You get the idea.
166.84	(Laughter)
168.64	So ...
171.28	that was another version of me:
173.32	one who will conquer the world.
175.88	Well, then two years later,
177.36	I was presented with the opportunity
177.36	to come to the United States.
181.32	I jumped on it,
182.92	because that was
182.92	where Bill Gates lived, right?
185.16	(Laughter)
186.4	I thought that was the start
186.4	of my entrepreneur journey.
189.68	Then, fast-forward another 14 years.
191.88	I was 30.
193.32	Nope, I didn't build that company.
195.72	I didn't even start.
197.28	I was actually a marketing manager
197.28	for a Fortune 500 company.
201.28	And I felt I was stuck;
202.92	I was stagnant.
205.08	Why is that?
206.32	Where is that 14-year-old
206.32	who wrote that letter?
209.48	It's not because he didn't try.
211.48	It's because every time I had a new idea,
214.56	every time I wanted to try something new,
216.56	even at work --
217.8	I wanted to make a proposal,
219.56	I wanted to speak up
219.56	in front of people in a group --
223.12	I felt there was this constant battle
224.96	between the 14-year-old
224.96	and the six-year-old.
227.76	One wanted to conquer the world --
229.92	make a difference --
231.16	another was afraid of rejection.
233.96	And every time that six-year-old won.
237.76	And this fear even persisted
237.76	after I started my own company.
241.76	I mean, I started
241.76	my own company when I was 30 --
244.92	if you want to be Bill Gates,
246.36	you've got to start
246.36	sooner or later, right?
249.08	When I was an entrepreneur,
251.64	I was presented
251.64	with an investment opportunity,
254.56	and then I was turned down.
257.04	And that rejection hurt me.
258.8	It hurt me so bad
258.8	that I wanted to quit right there.
263.28	But then I thought,
264.52	hey, would Bill Gates quit
264.52	after a simple investment rejection?
268.92	Would any successful
268.92	entrepreneur quit like that?
271.8	No way.
273.2	And this is where it clicked for me.
275.2	OK, I can build a better company.
277.04	I can build a better
277.04	team or better product,
279.28	but one thing for sure:
280.84	I've got to be a better leader.
282.72	I've got to be a better person.
284.72	I cannot let that six-year-old
284.72	keep dictating my life anymore.
288.12	I have to put him back in his place.
291	So this is where I went online
291	and looked for help.
293.44	Google was my friend.
294.72	(Laughter)
295.88	"I searched, ""How do I overcome"
295.88	"the fear of rejection?"""
298.96	I came up with a bunch
298.96	of psychology articles
301.84	about where the fear
301.84	and pain are coming from.
304.72	Then I came up with a bunch
304.72	"of ""rah-rah"" inspirational articles"
308.04	"about ""Don't take it personally,"
308.04	"just overcome it."""
311.2	Who doesn't know that?
312.88	(Laughter)
314.48	But why was I still so scared?
316.64	Then I found this website by luck.
318.68	It's called rejectiontherapy.com.
321.08	(Laughter)
323.64	"""Rejection Therapy"" was this game"
323.64	invented by this Canadian entrepreneur.
327.6	His name is Jason Comely.
329.32	And basically the idea is for 30 days
329.32	you go out and look for rejection,
334.44	and every day get rejected at something,
336.72	and then by the end,
336.72	you desensitize yourself from the pain.
341.2	And I loved that idea.
342.92	(Laughter)
344.48	"I said, ""You know what?"
344.48	I'm going to do this.
346.64	And I'll feel myself
346.64	"getting rejected 100 days."""
349.68	And I came up with my own rejection ideas,
352.12	and I made a video blog out of it.
355.6	And so here's what I did.
357.56	This is what the blog looked like.
360.2	Day One ...
362	(Laughter)
363.32	Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger.
367.72	So this is where I went
367.72	to where I was working.
370.48	I came downstairs
372.24	and I saw this big guy
372.24	sitting behind a desk.
374.48	He looked like a security guard.
376.24	So I just approached him.
377.8	And I was just walking
379.56	and that was the longest
379.56	walk of my life --
381.92	hair on the back
381.92	of my neck standing up,
384.08	I was sweating and my heart was pounding.
386.56	And I got there and said,
387.8	"""Hey, sir, can I borrow"
390.48	(Laughter)
391.84	"And he looked up, he's like, ""No."""
394.64	"""Why?"""
396.2	"And I just said, ""No? I'm sorry."""
398.52	Then I turned around,
398.52	and I just ran.
400.259	(Laughter)
402.96	I felt so embarrassed.
404.72	But because I filmed myself --
406.2	so that night I was watching
406.2	myself getting rejected,
409.36	I just saw how scared I was.
411.48	I looked like this kid
411.48	"in ""The Sixth Sense."""
413.96	I saw dead people.
415.4	(Laughter)
417.04	But then I saw this guy.
418.6	You know, he wasn't that menacing.
420.52	He was a chubby, loveable guy,
422.92	"and he even asked me, ""Why?"""
426.4	In fact, he invited me to explain myself.
428.84	And I could've said many things.
430.44	I could've explained,
430.44	I could've negotiated.
432.76	I didn't do any of that.
434.68	All I did was run.
437.16	I felt, wow, this is like
437.16	a microcosm of my life.
440.92	Every time I felt the slightest rejection,
443.48	I would just run as fast as I could.
445.64	And you know what?
446.92	The next day, no matter what happens,
448.76	I'm not going to run.
450.28	I'll stay engaged.
452.08	"Day Two: Request a ""burger refill."""
454.16	(Laughter)
456.16	It's when I went to a burger joint,
458.48	I finished lunch,
458.48	and I went to the cashier and said,
461	"""Hi, can I get a burger refill?"""
462.6	(Laughter)
464.8	He was all confused,
464.8	"like, ""What's a burger refill?"""
467.28	(Laughter)
468.56	"I said, ""Well, it's just like"
468.56	"a drink refill but with a burger."""
472.24	"And he said, ""Sorry,"
472.24	"we don't do burger refill, man."""
474.76	(Laughter)
476.12	So this is where rejection happened
476.12	and I could have run, but I stayed.
480.2	"I said, ""Well, I love your burgers,"
482.36	I love your joint,
483.8	and if you guys do a burger refill,
485.92	"I will love you guys more."""
487.28	(Laughter)
488.56	"And he said, ""Well, OK,"
488.56	I'll tell my manager about it,
491.2	and maybe we'll do it,
491.2	"but sorry, we can't do this today."""
494.2	Then I left.
495.64	And by the way,
497.52	I don't think they've
497.52	ever done burger refill.
499.8	(Laughter)
501.04	I think they're still there.
503.16	But the life and death feeling
503.16	I was feeling the first time
506.48	was no longer there,
507.84	just because I stayed engaged --
509.6	because I didn't run.
511.24	"I said, ""Wow, great,"
511.24	I'm already learning things.
514.52	"Great."""
515.76	And then Day Three:
515.76	Getting Olympic Doughnuts.
518.76	This is where my life
518.76	was turned upside down.
522.12	I went to a Krispy Kreme.
523.76	It's a doughnut shop
525	in mainly the Southeastern part
525	of the United States.
527.64	I'm sure they have some here, too.
529.52	And I went in,
530.799	"I said, ""Can you make me doughnuts"
530.799	that look like Olympic symbols?
533.96	Basically, you interlink
533.96	"five doughnuts together ... """
536.88	I mean there's no way
536.88	they could say yes, right?
539.64	The doughnut maker took me so seriously.
542.04	(Laughter)
543.28	So she put out paper,
544.52	started jotting down
544.52	the colors and the rings,
546.72	"and is like, ""How can I make this?"""
548.76	And then 15 minutes later,
550.68	she came out with a box
550.68	that looked like Olympic rings.
554.12	And I was so touched.
555.8	I just couldn't believe it.
557.96	And that video got
557.96	over five million views on Youtube.
562.44	The world couldn't believe that either.
564.56	(Laughter)
567.44	You know, because of that
567.44	I was in newspapers,
570.68	in talk shows, in everything.
572.12	And I became famous.
573.64	A lot of people
573.64	started writing emails to me
575.8	"and saying, ""What you're"
575.8	"doing is awesome."""
578.36	But you know, fame and notoriety
578.36	did not do anything to me.
581.92	What I really wanted to do was learn,
583.76	and to change myself.
585	So I turned the rest
585	of my 100 days of rejection
587.64	into this playground --
589.56	into this research project.
591.72	I wanted to see what I could learn.
594.24	And then I learned a lot of things.
596.04	I discovered so many secrets.
597.64	For example, I found if I just don't run,
600.56	if I got rejected,
601.84	"I could actually turn a ""no"" into a ""yes,"""
603.92	"and the magic word is, ""why."""
605.56	So one day I went to a stranger's house,
605.56	I had this flower in my hand,
609.68	knocked on the door and said,
611.12	"""Hey, can I plant this flower"
611.12	"in your backyard?"""
613.4	(Laughter)
614.96	"And he said, ""No."""
617.64	But before he could leave I said,
619.4	"""Hey, can I know why?"""
621.36	"And he said, ""Well, I have this dog"
624.44	that would dig up
624.44	anything I put in the backyard.
626.8	I don't want to waste your flower.
628.48	If you want to do this,
628.48	go across the street and talk to Connie.
631.68	"She loves flowers."""
632.92	So that's what I did.
634.16	I went across and knocked
634.16	on Connie's door.
636.24	And she was so happy to see me.
638.12	(Laughter)
639.84	And then half an hour later,
641.24	there was this flower
641.24	in Connie's backyard.
643.32	I'm sure it looks better now.
644.76	(Laughter)
646.08	But had I left
646.08	after the initial rejection,
649.04	I would've thought,
650.28	well, it's because
650.28	the guy didn't trust me,
652.36	it's because I was crazy,
653.6	because I didn't dress up well,
653.6	I didn't look good.
656.04	It was none of those.
657.28	It was because what I offered
657.28	did not fit what he wanted.
660	And he trusted me enough
660	to offer me a referral,
662.28	using a sales term.
663.96	I converted a referral.
666.56	Then one day --
667.8	and I also learned that I can
667.8	actually say certain things
670.72	and maximize my chance to get a yes.
672.68	So for example,
672.68	one day I went to a Starbucks,
674.92	and asked the manager,
674.92	"""Hey, can I be a Starbucks greeter?"""
678.52	"He was like, ""What's a Starbucks greeter?"""
680.92	"I said, ""Do you know"
680.92	those Walmart greeters?
683.04	You know, those people who say
683.04	'hi' to you before you walk in the store,
686.48	and make sure you
686.48	don't steal stuff, basically?
688.72	I want to give a Walmart experience
688.72	"to Starbucks customers."""
691.88	(Laughter)
693.36	Well, I'm not sure
693.36	that's a good thing, actually --
697.6	Actually, I'm pretty sure
697.6	it's a bad thing.
700.12	"And he was like, ""Oh"" --"
702.2	yeah, this is how he looked,
702.2	his name is Eric --
704.48	"and he was like, ""I'm not sure."""
706.08	"This is how he was hearing me. ""Not sure."""
708.16	"Then I ask him, ""Is that weird?"""
709.84	"He's like, ""Yeah, it's really weird, man."""
712.8	But as soon as he said that,
712.8	his whole demeanor changed.
715.68	It's as if he's putting
715.68	all the doubt on the floor.
718.64	"And he said, ""Yeah, you can do this,"
720.4	"just don't get too weird."""
721.68	(Laughter)
723.12	So for the next hour
723.12	I was the Starbucks greeter.
725.52	"I said ""hi"" to every customer"
725.52	that walked in,
727.68	and gave them holiday cheers.
730.08	By the way, I don't know
730.08	what your career trajectory is,
732.76	don't be a greeter.
734	(Laughter)
735.24	It was really boring.
737.2	But then I found I could do this
737.2	"because I mentioned, ""Is that weird?"""
742.16	I mentioned the doubt that he was having.
744.32	"And because I mentioned, ""Is that weird?"","
744.32	that means I wasn't weird.
747.88	That means I was actually
747.88	thinking just like him,
750.44	seeing this as a weird thing.
752.84	And again, and again,
754.12	I learned that if I mention
754.12	some doubt people might have
757.28	before I ask the question,
759.12	I gained their trust.
760.4	People were more likely to say yes to me.
762.8	And then I learned
762.8	I could fulfill my life dream ...
766.16	by asking.
767.6	You know, I came
767.6	from four generations of teachers,
770.72	and my grandma has always told me,
773.56	"""Hey Jia, you can do anything you want,"
775.88	but it'd be great
775.88	"if you became a teacher."""
777.96	(Laughter)
779.4	But I wanted to be
779.4	an entrepreneur, so I didn't.
781.68	But it has always been my dream
781.68	to actually teach something.
785.08	"So I said, ""What if I just ask"
786.92	"and teach a college class?"""
789.56	I lived in Austin at the time,
791.04	so I went to University
791.04	of Texas at Austin
793.12	and knocked on professors' doors
793.12	"and said, ""Can I teach your class?"""
796.36	I didn't get anywhere
796.36	the first couple of times.
798.88	But because I didn't run --
798.88	I kept doing it --
801.4	and on the third try
801.4	the professor was very impressed.
804.76	"He was like, ""No one"
804.76	"has done this before."""
806.84	And I came in prepared
806.84	with powerpoints and my lesson.
810.88	"He said, ""Wow, I can use this."
812.96	Why don't you come back in two months?
812.96	"I'll fit you in my curriculum."""
816.32	And two months later
816.32	I was teaching a class.
818.44	This is me -- you probably can't see,
818.44	this is a bad picture.
821.72	You know, sometimes you get
821.72	rejected by lighting, you know?
824.52	(Laughter)
826.68	But wow --
827.92	when I finished teaching that class,
827.92	I walked out crying,
830.68	because I thought
832.48	I could fulfill my life dream
832.48	just by simply asking.
835.8	I used to think I have to accomplish
835.8	all these things --
838.48	have to be a great entrepreneur,
838.48	or get a PhD to teach --
842.12	but no, I just asked,
843.68	and I could teach.
845.4	And in that picture,
845.4	which you can't see,
847.8	I quoted Martin Luther King, Jr.
851.12	Why? Because in my research I found
851.12	that people who really change the world,
855.68	who change the way we live
855.68	and the way we think,
858.64	are the people who were met
858.64	with initial and often violent rejections.
862.76	People like Martin Luther King, Jr.,
864.84	like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela,
866.92	or even Jesus Christ.
868.48	These people did not
868.48	let rejection define them.
871.88	They let their own reaction
871.88	after rejection define themselves.
876.92	And they embraced rejection.
879.36	And we don't have to be those people
879.36	to learn about rejection,
882.6	and in my case,
883.88	rejection was my curse,
885.92	was my boogeyman.
887.2	It has bothered me my whole life
887.2	because I was running away from it.
891.4	Then I started embracing it.
893.8	I turned that into
893.8	the biggest gift in my life.
897.32	I started teaching people
897.32	how to turn rejections into opportunities.
901.8	I use my blog, I use my talk,
903.84	I use the book I just published,
905.76	and I'm even building technology to help
905.76	people overcome their fear of rejection.
912.2	When you get rejected in life,
913.96	when you are facing the next obstacle
916.2	or next failure,
918.24	consider the possibilities.
920.08	Don't run.
921.32	If you just embrace them,
922.56	they might become your gifts as well.
925.16	Thank you.
926.4	(Applause)
