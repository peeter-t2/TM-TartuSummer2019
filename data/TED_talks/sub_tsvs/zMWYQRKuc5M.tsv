12.553	OK, so today I want to talk
12.553	about how we talk about love.
17.237	And specifically,
18.411	I want to talk about what's wrong
18.411	with how we talk about love.
22.673	Most of us will probably
22.673	fall in love a few times
26.104	over the course of our lives,
27.593	and in the English language,
27.593	this metaphor, falling,
31.827	is really the main way that we
31.827	talk about that experience.
35.592	I don't know about you,
36.767	but when I conceptualize this metaphor,
38.718	what I picture is straight
38.718	out of a cartoon --
42.076	like there's a man,
43.396	he's walking down the sidewalk,
45.137	without realizing it, he crosses
45.137	over an open manhole,
48.273	and he just plummets into the sewer below.
51.958	And I picture it this way
51.958	because falling is not jumping.
56.769	Falling is accidental,
58.825	it's uncontrollable.
60.751	It's something that happens to us
60.751	without our consent.
64.3	And this --
65.517	this is the main way we talk
65.517	about starting a new relationship.
70.336	I am a writer and I'm also
70.336	an English teacher,
74.127	which means I think
74.127	about words for a living.
76.436	You could say that I get paid
76.436	to argue that the language we use matters,
80.61	and I would like to argue
80.61	that many of the metaphors we use
84.834	to talk about love --
86.425	maybe even most of them --
88.272	are a problem.
90.7	So, in love, we fall.
93.766	We're struck.
95.255	We are crushed.
97.331	We swoon.
99.186	We burn with passion.
101.738	Love makes us crazy,
103.739	and it makes us sick.
105.796	Our hearts ache,
107.18	and then they break.
110.226	So our metaphors equate
110.226	the experience of loving someone
113.394	to extreme violence or illness.
116.071	(Laughter)
119.101	They do.
120.276	And they position us as the victims
122.283	of unforeseen and totally
122.283	unavoidable circumstances.
126.547	"My favorite one of these is ""smitten,"""
129.294	which is the past participle
129.294	"of the word ""smite."""
132.172	And if you look this word up
132.172	in the dictionary --
135.264	(Laughter)
136.312	you will see that it can be defined
136.312	"as both ""grievous affliction,"""
140.854	"and, ""to be very much in love."""
145.716	"I tend to associate the word ""smite"""
145.716	with a very particular context,
149.084	which is the Old Testament.
151.56	In the Book of Exodus alone,
151.56	there are 16 references to smiting,
156.332	which is the word that the Bible uses
156.332	for the vengeance of an angry God.
160.129	(Laughter)
161.874	Here we are using the same word
161.874	to talk about love
164.603	that we use to explain
164.603	a plague of locusts.
167.053	(Laughter)
168.105	Right?
169.385	So, how did this happen?
171.501	How have we come to associate love
171.501	with great pain and suffering?
175.516	And why do we talk about
175.516	this ostensibly good experience
179.529	as if we are victims?
182.556	These are difficult questions,
184.271	but I have some theories.
185.941	And to think this through,
187.204	I want to focus on one
187.204	metaphor in particular,
189.856	which is the idea of love as madness.
193.088	When I first started
193.088	researching romantic love,
195.819	I found these madness
195.819	metaphors everywhere.
198.604	The history of Western culture
200.731	is full of language that equates
200.731	love to mental illness.
205.44	These are just a few examples.
207.391	William Shakespeare:
208.758	"""Love is merely a madness,"""
210.215	"from ""As You Like It."""
212.092	Friedrich Nietzsche:
213.373	"""There is always some madness in love."""
216.559	"""Got me looking, got me looking"
216.559	"so crazy in love -- """
219.449	(Laughter)
221.542	from the great philosopher,
221.542	Beyoncé Knowles.
224.164	(Laughter)
227.083	I fell in love for the first
227.083	time when I was 20,
229.941	and it was a pretty turbulent
229.941	relationship right from the start.
233.459	And it was long distance
233.459	for the first couple of years,
236.688	so for me that meant very high highs
236.688	and very low lows.
241.794	I can remember one moment in particular.
244.58	I was sitting on a bed
244.58	in a hostel in South America,
247.949	and I was watching the person
247.949	I love walk out the door.
252.151	And it was late,
253.788	it was nearly midnight,
255.072	we'd gotten into an argument over dinner,
257.073	and when we got back to our room,
259.046	he threw his things in the bag
259.046	and stormed out.
263.141	While I can no longer remember
263.141	what that argument was about,
266.424	I very clearly remember
266.424	how I felt watching him leave.
271.122	I was 22, it was my first time
271.122	in the developing world,
275.424	and I was totally alone.
278.412	I had another week until my flight home,
281.803	and I knew the name
281.803	of the town that I was in,
284.195	and the name of the city
284.195	that I needed to get to to fly out,
287.802	but I had no idea how to get around.
291.842	I had no guidebook and very little money,
295.043	and I spoke no Spanish.
297.547	Someone more adventurous than me
299.668	might have seen this as
299.668	a moment of opportunity,
302.122	but I just froze.
304.406	I just sat there.
306.738	And then I burst into tears.
309.357	But despite my panic,
311.752	some small voice in my head thought,
314.346	"""Wow. That was dramatic."
316.707	I must really be doing
316.707	"this love thing right."""
319.43	(Laughter)
321.242	Because some part of me
321.242	wanted to feel miserable in love.
326.226	And it sounds so strange
326.226	to me now, but at 22,
329.69	I longed to have dramatic experiences,
332.859	and in that moment, I was irrational
332.859	and furious and devastated,
338.081	and weirdly enough,
339.329	I thought that this somehow
339.329	legitimized the feelings I had
342.729	for the guy who had just left me.
346.163	I think on some level I wanted
346.163	to feel a little bit crazy,
350.55	because I thought that
350.55	that was how loved worked.
355.141	This really should not be surprising,
356.972	considering that according to Wikipedia,
359.45	there are eight films,
363.768	two albums and one novel
363.768	"with the title ""Crazy Love."""
367.837	About half an hour later,
367.837	he came back to our room.
370.987	We made up.
372.162	We spent another mostly
372.162	happy week traveling together.
375.003	And then, when I got home,
376.459	"I thought, ""That was so"
376.459	terrible and so great.
381.989	"This must be a real romance."""
385.006	I expected my first love
385.006	to feel like madness,
387.73	and of course, it met
387.73	that expectation very well.
391.941	But loving someone like that --
393.656	as if my entire well-being depended
393.656	on him loving me back --
397.775	was not very good for me
399.892	or for him.
401.85	But I suspect this experience of love
401.85	is not that unusual.
406.026	Most of us do feel a bit mad
406.026	in the early stages of romantic love.
410.815	In fact, there is research to confirm
410.815	that this is somewhat normal,
415.28	because, neurochemically speaking,
417.19	romantic love and mental illness
417.19	are not that easily distinguished.
423.046	This is true.
424.221	This study from 1999 used blood tests
428.804	to confirm that the serotonin
428.804	levels of the newly in love
431.922	very closely resembled
431.922	the serotonin levels
434.743	of people who had been diagnosed
434.743	with obsessive-compulsive disorder.
438.072	(Laughter)
439.104	Yes, and low levels of serotonin
441.825	are also associated
441.825	with seasonal affective disorder
445.451	and depression.
447.687	So there is some evidence
449.971	that love is associated with changes
449.971	to our moods and our behaviors.
454.343	And there are other studies to confirm
458.374	that most relationships begin this way.
462.66	Researchers believe
462.66	that the low levels of serotonin
466.847	is correlated with obsessive thinking
466.847	about the object of love,
470.906	which is like this feeling that someone
470.906	has set up camp in your brain.
474.988	And most of us feel this way
474.988	when we first fall in love.
477.943	But the good news is,
477.943	it doesn't always last that long --
481.093	usually from a few months
481.093	to a couple of years.
485.352	When I got back from my trip
485.352	to South America,
488.184	I spent a lot of time alone in my room,
491.785	checking my email,
493.149	desperate to hear from the guy I loved.
496.545	I decided that if my friends could not
496.545	understand my grievous affliction,
501.917	then I did not need their friendship.
503.89	So I stopped hanging out
503.89	with most of them.
506.387	And it was probably the most
506.387	unhappy year of my life.
511.086	But I think I felt like
511.086	it was my job to be miserable,
515.849	because if I could be miserable,
517.665	then I would prove how much I loved him.
520.356	And if I could prove it,
522.265	then we would have to end up
522.265	together eventually.
526.05	This is the real madness,
528.162	because there is no cosmic rule
530.581	that says that great suffering
530.581	equals great reward,
534.478	but we talk about love as if this is true.
539.463	Our experiences of love
539.463	are both biological and cultural.
543.774	Our biology tells us that love is good
546.257	by activating these reward
546.257	circuits in our brain,
549.435	and it tells us that love is painful
549.435	when, after a fight or a breakup,
554.079	that neurochemical reward is withdrawn.
557.155	And in fact -- and maybe
557.155	you've heard this --
559.621	neurochemically speaking,
561.489	going through a breakup is a lot
561.489	like going through cocaine withdrawal,
565.675	which I find reassuring.
567.335	(Laughter)
569.066	And then our culture uses language
571.922	to shape and reinforce
571.922	these ideas about love.
574.727	In this case, we're talking
574.727	about metaphors about pain
577.375	and addiction and madness.
579.826	It's kind of an interesting feedback loop.
582.294	Love is powerful and at times painful,
585.835	and we express this
585.835	in our words and stories,
589.182	but then our words and stories prime us
591.704	to expect love to be powerful and painful.
595.955	What's interesting to me
595.955	is that all of this happens
599.152	in a culture that values
599.152	lifelong monogamy.
602.658	It seems like we want it both ways:
604.743	we want love to feel like madness,
607.718	and we want it to last an entire lifetime.
611.561	That sounds terrible.
613.148	(Laughter)
615.853	To reconcile this,
617.473	we need to either change our culture
617.473	or change our expectations.
623.408	So, imagine if we were all
623.408	less passive in love.
627.642	If we were more assertive,
627.642	more open-minded, more generous
631.812	and instead of falling in love,
635.137	we stepped into love.
638.223	I know that this is asking a lot,
640.176	but I'm not actually
640.176	the first person to suggest this.
645.012	"In their book, ""Metaphors We Live By,"""
647.545	linguists Mark Johnson and George Lakoff
647.545	suggest a really interesting solution
652.683	to this dilemma,
654.491	which is to change our metaphors.
657.795	They argue that metaphors really do shape
657.795	the way we experience the world,
663.071	and that they can even act
663.071	as a guide for future actions,
666.593	like self-fulfilling prophecies.
669.489	Johnson and Lakoff suggest
669.489	a new metaphor for love:
673.977	love as a collaborative work of art.
676.872	I really like this way
676.872	of thinking about love.
681.028	Linguists talk about metaphors
681.028	as having entailments,
684.574	which is essentially a way of considering
684.574	all the implications of,
688.394	or ideas contained
688.394	within, a given metaphor.
691.35	And Johnson and Lakoff
691.35	talk about everything
694.283	that collaborating
694.283	on a work of art entails:
696.976	effort, compromise,
696.976	patience, shared goals.
701.655	These ideas align nicely
701.655	with our cultural investment
705.509	in long-term romantic commitment,
707.606	but they also work well
707.606	for other kinds of relationships --
712.02	short-term, casual, polyamorous,
712.02	non-monogamous, asexual --
717.7	because this metaphor brings
717.7	much more complex ideas
721.609	to the experience of loving someone.
724.67	So if love is a collaborative work of art,
729.088	then love is an aesthetic experience.
733.524	Love is unpredictable,
736.153	love is creative,
738.898	love requires communication
738.898	and discipline,
743.055	it is frustrating
743.055	and emotionally demanding.
746.677	And love involves both joy and pain.
750.742	Ultimately, each experience
750.742	of love is different.
755.759	When I was younger,
757.41	it never occurred to me that I was allowed
757.41	to demand more from love,
762.102	that I didn't have to just accept
762.102	whatever love offered.
766.775	When 14-year-old Juliet first meets --
770.128	or, when 14-year-old Juliet
770.128	cannot be with Romeo,
774.077	whom she has met four days ago,
776.738	she does not feel disappointed or angsty.
781.022	Where is she?
782.403	She wants to die.
784.236	Right?
785.411	And just as a refresher,
785.411	at this point in the play,
787.904	act three of five,
789.236	Romeo is not dead.
791.641	He's alive,
793.005	he's healthy,
794.417	he's just been banished from the city.
797.853	I understand that 16th-century Verona
797.853	is unlike contemporary North America,
803.878	and yet when I first read this play,
806.88	also at age 14,
809.297	Juliet's suffering made sense to me.
813.295	Reframing love as something
813.295	I get to create with someone I admire,
818.676	rather than something
818.676	that just happens to me
821.144	without my control or consent,
823.69	is empowering.
825.779	It's still hard.
827.421	Love still feels totally maddening
827.421	and crushing some days,
832.977	and when I feel really frustrated,
835.116	I have to remind myself:
836.995	my job in this relationship
836.995	is to talk to my partner
840.363	about what I want to make together.
843.923	This isn't easy, either.
846.756	But it's just so much better
846.756	than the alternative,
850.672	which is that thing
850.672	that feels like madness.
854.839	This version of love is not about winning
854.839	or losing someone's affection.
860.761	Instead, it requires
860.761	that you trust your partner
864.383	and talk about things
864.383	when trusting feels difficult,
867.481	which sounds so simple,
869.951	but is actually a kind
869.951	of revolutionary, radical act.
875.062	This is because you get to stop
875.062	thinking about yourself
879.23	and what you're gaining
879.23	or losing in your relationship,
882.395	and you get to start thinking
882.395	about what you have to offer.
886.811	This version of love
886.811	allows us to say things like,
890.24	"""Hey, we're not very good collaborators."
890.24	"Maybe this isn't for us."""
895.733	"Or, ""That relationship"
895.733	was shorter than I had planned,
899.618	"but it was still kind of beautiful."""
902.836	The beautiful thing
902.836	about the collaborative work of art
905.65	is that it will not paint
905.65	or draw or sculpt itself.
909.098	This version of love allows us
909.098	to decide what it looks like.
913.033	Thank you.
914.208	(Applause)
