12.8	Here's my thing.
14.72	Hold on. There I go. Hey.
18.24	I want to start today --
18.24	talk about the structure of a polypeptide.
21.47	(Laughter)
23.84	I get a lot of people asking me,
23.84	"in terms of ""Lost,"" you know,"
28.04	"""What the hell's that island?"""
29.52	You know, it's usually followed by,
32.48	"""No, seriously,"
32.48	"what the hell is that island?"""
34.68	Why so many mysteries?
35.96	What is it about mystery
35.96	that I seem to be drawn to?
39.92	And I was thinking about this,
39.92	what to talk about at TED.
42.64	When I talked to the kind rep from TED,
45.84	"and I said, ""Listen, you know,"
45.84	"what should I talk about?"""
48.56	"He said, ""Don't worry about it."
48.56	"Just be profound."""
50.96	(Laughter)
52.28	And I took enormous comfort in that.
54.04	So thank you, if you're here.
55.68	I was trying to think,
55.68	what do I talk about? Good question.
58.52	Why do I do so much
58.52	stuff that involves mystery?
60.8	And I started trying to figure it out.
62.68	And I started thinking
62.68	about why do I do any of what I do,
65.44	and I started thinking
65.44	about my grandfather.
67.56	I loved my grandfather.
69.36	Harry Kelvin was his name,
69.36	my mother's father.
72.48	He died in 1986. He was an amazing guy.
75.24	And one of the reasons he was amazing:
77.119	After World War II,
77.119	he began an electronics company.
79.572	He started selling surplus parts,
79.572	kits, to schools and stuff.
84.16	So he had this incredible curiosity.
85.96	As a kid, I saw him come over to me
87.88	with radios and telephones
87.88	and all sorts of things.
90.32	And he'd open them up, he'd unscrew them
90.32	and reveal the inner workings --
93.8	which many of us,
93.8	I'm sure, take for granted.
95.96	But it's an amazing gift to give a kid.
98.56	To open up this thing
98.56	and show how it works
101.16	and why it works and what it is.
102.8	He was the ultimate
102.8	deconstructor, in many ways.
105.8	And my grandfather was a kind of guy
105.8	who would not only take things apart,
112.08	but he got me interested
112.08	in all sorts of different odd crafts,
115.36	like, you know, printing,
115.36	like the letter press.
118.52	I'm obsessed with printing.
119.92	I'm obsessed with silk-screening
119.92	and bookbinding and box making.
123.4	When I was a kid, I was always,
123.4	like, taking apart boxes and stuff.
127.68	And last night in the hotel,
127.68	I took apart the Kleenex box.
130.44	I was just looking at it.
130.44	And I'm telling you --
132.8	(Laughter)
134.24	It's a beautiful thing. I swear to God.
136.16	I mean, when you look at the box
136.16	and you sort of see how it works.
139.32	Rives is here, and I met him
139.32	years ago at a book fair;
141.919	he does pop-up books.
143.16	And I'm obsessed
143.16	with engineering of paper.
145.24	The scoring of it, the printing of it,
147.12	where the thing gets glued,
147.12	the registration marks for the ink.
150.12	I just love boxes.
151.36	My grandfather was the guy
152.64	who kind of got me
152.64	into all sorts of these things.
155.44	He would also supply me with tools.
157.16	He was this amazing encourager --
157.16	this patron, sort of, to make stuff.
162.76	And he got me a Super 8 camera
162.76	when I was 10 years old.
166.32	And in 1976, that was sort of an anomaly,
168.84	to be a 10-year-old kid
168.84	that had access to a camera.
171.84	And you know, he was so generous;
171.84	I couldn't believe it.
175.48	He wasn't doing it
175.48	entirely without some manipulation.
178.96	I mean, I would call him, and I'd be like,
181	"""Listen, Grandpa,"
181	I really need this camera.
183.56	You don't understand.
183.56	This is, like, I want to make movies.
186.36	"I'll get invited to TED one day --"""
188.76	(Laughter)
189.8	And, you know, my grandmother
189.8	was the greatest.
192.04	Because she'd be like, you know --
192.04	she'd get on the phone.
194.8	"She'd be like, ""Harry,"
194.8	it's better than the drugs.
198.52	She was fantastic.
200.508	So I found myself getting this stuff,
200.508	thanks to her assist,
203.76	and suddenly, you know,
205.04	I had a synthesizer
205.04	when I was 14 years old --
208.16	this kind of stuff.
209.4	And it let me make things,
209.4	which, to me, was sort of the dream.
213.48	He sort of humored my obsession
213.48	to other things too, like magic.
217.04	The thing is, we'd go
217.04	to this magic store in New York City
219.8	called Lou Tannen's Magic.
221.2	It was this great magic store.
222.68	It was a crappy
222.68	little building in Midtown,
224.72	but you'd be in the elevator,
224.72	the elevator would open --
227.4	there'd be this little, small magic store.
229.48	You'd be in the magic store.
229.48	And it was a magical place.
232.16	So I got all these magic tricks.
232.16	Here. I'll show you.
234.68	This is the kind of thing.
234.68	So it would be like, you know.
237.56	Which is good, but now I can't move.
239.4	Now, I have to do
239.4	the rest of the thing like this.
241.84	"I'm like, ""Oh, wow."
241.84	"Look at my computer over there!"""
244.32	(Laughter)
246.56	So one of the things
246.56	that I bought at the magic store was this:
249.96	Tannen's Mystery Magic Box.
251.76	The premise behind the Mystery
251.76	Magic Box was the following:
259.24	Which is a savings.
260.48	(Laughter)
262.36	Now, I bought this decades ago
262.36	and I'm not kidding.
264.8	If you look at this,
264.8	you'll see it's never been opened.
267.44	But I've had this forever.
269.6	Now, I was looking at this,
270.96	it was in my office,
270.96	as it always is, on the shelf,
273.4	and I was thinking,
273.4	why have I not opened this?
276.8	And why have I kept it?
278.8	Because I'm not a pack rat.
280.16	I don't keep everything,
281.4	but for some reason
281.4	I haven't opened this box.
283.6	And I felt like there was
283.6	a key to this, somehow,
285.96	in talking about something at TED
285.96	that I haven't discussed before,
289.36	and bored people elsewhere.
291.6	So I thought, maybe
291.6	there's something with this.
293.88	And there was this giant question mark.
295.8	I love the design,
295.8	for what it's worth, of this thing.
298.36	And I started thinking,
298.36	why haven't I opened it?
300.64	And I realized that I haven't opened it
302.56	because it represents
302.56	something important -- to me.
305.16	It represents my grandfather.
307.52	Am I allowed to cry at TED?
308.92	Because -- no, I'm not going to cry.
310.659	(Laughter)
311.84	But --
313.015	(Laughter)
316.76	The thing is that it represents
316.76	infinite possibility.
320.88	It represents hope.
320.88	It represents potential.
323.08	And what I love about this box,
325.88	and what I realize I sort of do
325.88	in whatever it is that I do,
330.64	is I find myself
330.64	drawn to infinite possibility,
335.64	that sense of potential.
336.88	And I realize that mystery
336.88	is the catalyst for imagination.
339.68	Now, it's not the most
339.68	ground-breaking idea,
341.8	but when I started to think
341.8	that maybe there are times
344.4	when mystery is more important
344.4	than knowledge.
346.6	I started getting interested in this.
348.44	"And so I started thinking about ""Lost"""
348.44	and the stuff that we do,
351.48	and I realized, oh my God, mystery boxes
351.48	are everywhere in what I do!
355	"In the creation of ""Lost,"""
355	Damon Lindelof and I,
357.44	who created the show with me,
358.88	we were basically tasked
358.88	with creating this series
362.04	that we had very little time to do.
363.76	We had 11 and a half weeks
365.28	to write it, cast it, crew it, shoot it,
365.28	cut it, post it, turn in a two-hour pilot.
370.08	So it was not a lot of time.
371.48	And that sense of possibility --
371.48	what could this thing be?
374.28	There was no time to develop it.
375.88	I'm sure you're all familiar with people
377.84	who tell you what you can't do
377.84	and what you should change.
380.6	There was no time for that,
380.6	which is kind of amazing.
383.12	And so we did this show,
384.4	and for those of you
384.4	who haven't seen it, or don't know it,
387.2	I can show you one
387.2	little clip from the pilot,
389.56	just to show you some stuff that we did.
391.8	(Engine roaring)
400.56	(Video) Claire: Help!
402.52	Please help me!
404.72	Help me! Please, help me!
408.76	Jack: Get him out of here!
408.76	Get him away from the engine!
411.56	Get him out of here!
412.848	(Engine roaring)
418.96	C: Help me, please!
418.96	I'm having contractions!
422.32	J: How many months pregnant are you?
424.08	C: I'm only eight months.
425.56	J: And how far apart are they coming?
427.4	C: I don't know. I think it just happened.
431.16	Man: Hey! Hey! Hey, get away from --
443.56	JJ Abrams: 10 years ago,
443.56	if we wanted to do that,
445.92	we'd have to kill a stuntman.
447.36	(Laughter)
452.44	It would be harder.
454.4	Take two would be a bitch.
455.76	(Laughter)
457.04	So the amazing thing was,
457.04	we were able to do this thing.
460.16	And part of that was
460.16	the amazing availability of technology,
463.04	knowing we could do anything.
464.48	I mean, we could never have done that.
466.36	We might have been able to write it;
468.12	we wouldn't have been able
468.12	to depict it like we did.
470.6	So part of the amazing thing for me
470.6	is in the creative process,
473.6	technology is mind-blowingly
473.6	inspiring to me.
475.76	I realize that that blank page
475.76	is a magic box, you know?
479.04	It needs to be filled
479.04	with something fantastic.
481.28	"I used to have the ""Ordinary People"""
481.28	script that I'd flip through.
484.44	The romance was amazing to me;
484.44	it would inspire me.
486.88	I wanted to try and fill pages
488.36	with the same kind of spirit
488.36	and thought and emotion
492.16	that that script did.
493.4	So, you know, I love Apple computers.
495.88	I'm obsessed.
497.12	So the Apple computer --
497.12	the PowerBook -- this computer,
499.84	it challenges me.
501.08	It basically says, what are you
501.08	going to write worthy of me?
503.96	I feel this -- I'm compelled.
505.68	(Laughter)
507	And I often am like,
507	you know, dude, today I'm out.
509.44	I got nothing. You know? So there's that.
511.6	In terms of the content of it,
513.08	you look at stories, you think,
513.08	what are stories but mystery boxes?
516.28	There's a fundamental question --
516.28	in TV, the first act is called the teaser.
519.92	It's literally the teaser.
519.92	It's the big question.
522.28	So you're drawn into it.
522.28	Then there's another question.
524.92	"And it goes on. Look at ""Star Wars."""
526.68	The droids meet the mysterious woman.
528.52	Who's that? We don't know. Mystery box!
528.52	Then you meet Luke Skywalker.
531.8	He gets the droid,
531.8	you see the holographic image.
534.16	You learn it's a message.
534.16	She wants to find Obi Wan Kenobi.
537	He's her only hope.
537	But who's Obi Wan Kenobi?
539.16	Mystery box! So then he meets Ben Kenobi.
541.137	Ben Kenobi is Obi Wan Kenobi.
541.137	Holy shit! So it keeps us --
543.88	(Laughter)
544.92	Have you guys not seen that?
546.32	(Laughter)
547.36	It's huge! Anyway --
548.6	So there's this thing with mystery boxes
548.6	that I started feeling compelled.
554.2	Then there's the thing of mystery
554.2	in terms of imagination --
557.8	the withholding of information.
560.32	You know, doing that intentionally
560.32	is much more engaging.
564.36	"Whether it's like the shark in ""Jaws"" --"
566.32	if Spielberg's mechanical shark,
566.32	Bruce, had worked,
568.84	it would not be remotely as scary;
568.84	you would have seen it too much.
572.04	"In ""Alien"", they never"
572.04	really showed the alien: terrifying!
574.88	Even in a movie like
574.88	"a romantic comedy, ""The Graduate,"""
578.04	they're having that date,
578.04	and they're in the car,
580.4	and it's loud, and so they put the top up.
582.68	You don't hear anything they're saying!
584.6	You can't hear a word!
584.6	But it's the most romantic date ever.
587.48	And you love it because you don't hear it.
589.56	So to me, there's that.
589.56	And then, finally, there's this idea --
593.16	stretching the paradigm a little bit --
595.44	but the idea of the mystery box.
597.72	Meaning, what you think you're getting,
597.72	then what you're really getting.
601.16	And it's true in so many
601.16	movies and stories.
603.28	"Look at ""E.T.,"" for example --"
604.76	"""E.T."" is this unbelievable"
604.76	movie about what?
606.92	It's about an alien
606.92	who meets a kid, right?
608.96	"Well, it's not. ""E.T."" is about divorce."
610.92	"""E.T."" is about a heartbroken,"
610.92	divorce-crippled family,
613.56	and ultimately,
613.56	this kid who can't find his way.
615.84	"""Die Hard,"" right? Crazy, great, fun,"
615.84	action-adventure movie in a building.
619.4	It's about a guy
619.4	who's on the verge of divorce.
621.64	He's showing up to L.A.,
621.64	tail between his legs.
623.88	There are great scenes --
625.12	maybe not the most amazing
625.12	dramatic scenes in the history of time,
628.28	but pretty great scenes.
629.52	There's a half an hour
629.52	of investment in character
631.88	before you get to the stuff
631.88	that you're expecting.
634.28	"When you look at a movie like ""Jaws,"""
636.12	the scene that you expect --
636.12	we have the screen?
638.4	These are the kind of scenes
639.8	"that you remember and expect from ""Jaws."""
642.28	And she's being eaten;
644.4	there's a shark.
645.72	(Woman screaming)
646.96	"The thing about ""Jaws"" is,"
646.96	it's really about a guy
649.36	who is sort of dealing with his place
649.36	in the world -- with his masculinity,
652.92	with his family, how he's going to,
652.92	you know, make it work in this new town.
656.52	This is one of my favorite scenes ever,
658.44	and this is a scene
658.44	that you wouldn't necessarily think of
661.2	"when you think of ""Jaws."""
661.2	But it's an amazing scene.
718.8	(Video) Father: C'mere.
723.6	Give us a kiss.
725.56	Son: Why?
728.84	Father: 'Cause I need it.
730.88	"JJA: Come on. ""Why? 'Cause I need it""?"
732.714	Best scene ever, right?
733.98	(Laughter)
735.02	"Come on! So you think of ""Jaws"" --"
736.84	so that's the kind of stuff that,
738.48	like, you know --
738.48	the investment of character,
741.44	which is the stuff that really
741.44	is inside the box, you know?
744.24	It's why when people do sequels,
744.24	or rip off movies, you know, of a genre,
747.72	they're ripping off the wrong thing.
749.48	You're not supposed
749.48	to rip off the shark or the monster.
752.16	You know, if you rip something off --
752.16	rip off the character.
755.04	Rip off the stuff that matters.
756.6	I mean, look inside yourself
756.6	and figure out what is inside you.
759.6	Because ultimately,
759.6	the mystery box is all of us.
762.08	So there's that. Then the distribution.
763.962	What's a bigger mystery box
763.962	than a movie theater? You know?
766.8	You go to the theater,
766.8	you're just so excited to see anything.
769.76	The moment the lights go down
769.76	is often the best part.
772.28	And you're full of that amazing --
772.28	that feeling of excited anticipation.
776.76	And often, the movie's there
776.76	and it's going,
778.88	and then something happens
778.88	"and you go, ""Oh --"", and then, ""Mmm ..."""
782.08	When it's a great movie,
782.08	you're along for the ride
784.48	because you're willing
784.48	to give yourself to it.
786.647	So to me, whether it's a TV,
786.647	an iPod, computer, cell phone --
790.48	It's funny, I'm an --
790.48	as I said, Apple fanatic --
792.84	and one day, about a year or so ago,
794.6	I was signing on online in the morning
794.6	to watch Steve Jobs' keynote,
798.32	because I always do.
799.56	And he came on,
799.56	he was presenting the video iPod,
802.72	and what was on
802.72	the enormous iPod behind him?
805.52	"""Lost""! I had no idea!"
807.84	And I realized, holy shit,
807.84	it'd come full circle.
810.2	The inspiration I get from the technology
812.177	is now using the stuff that I do
812.177	to sell technology. It's nuts!
815.16	(Laughter)
816.4	I was going to show you a couple
816.4	of other things I'm going to skip.
819.68	I'll show you one other thing
819.68	that has nothing to do with anything.
822.88	This is something online;
822.88	six years ago, they did this.
825.54	This is an online thing done by guys
825.54	who had some visual effects experience.
829.14	But the point was,
829.14	that they were doing things
831.34	that were using these mystery boxes
831.34	that they had -- everyone has now.
834.66	What I've realized is what my grandfather
834.66	did for me when I was a kid,
838.02	everyone has access to now.
839.84	You don't need to have my grandfather,
839.84	though you wish you had.
842.84	But I have to tell you --
844.12	this is a guy doing stuff
844.12	on a Quadra 950 computer --
846.64	the resolution's a little bit low --
848.4	using Infinity software
848.4	they stopped making 15 years ago.
851.12	He's doing stuff that looks as amazing
853	as stuff I've seen
853	released from Hollywood.
856.2	The most incredible
856.2	sort of mystery, I think,
859.2	is now the question of what comes next.
861.96	Because it is now democratized.
864	So now, the creation of media --
864	it's everywhere.
866.52	The stuff that I was lucky
866.52	and begging for to get when I was a kid
870.36	is now ubiquitous.
871.6	And so, there's an amazing sense
871.6	of opportunity out there.
874.44	And when I think of the filmmakers
874.44	who exist out there now
877.56	who would have been silenced, you know --
879.56	who have been silenced in the past --
882	it's a very exciting thing.
883.36	I used to say in classes
883.36	and lectures and stuff,
886.52	to someone who wants to write,
886.52	"""Go! Write! Do your thing."""
889.28	It's free, you don't need permission.
891.08	"But now I can say, ""Go make your movie!"""
891.08	There's nothing stopping you
894.36	from going out there
894.36	and getting the technology.
896.64	You can lease, rent,
896.64	buy stuff off the shelf
899.08	that is either as good, or just as good,
902.88	as the stuff that's being used
902.88	"by the, you know, ""legit people."""
906.44	No community is best served
906.44	when only the elite have control.
910.6	And I feel like
910.6	this is an amazing opportunity
912.8	to see what else is out there.
914.28	"When I did ""Mission: Impossible III,"""
914.28	we had amazing visual effects.
917.52	ILM did the effects; it was incredible.
919.44	And sort of my dream to be involved.
921.2	And there are a couple
921.2	of sequences in the movie,
923.56	like these couple of moments
923.56	I'll show you.
930.68	There's that.
938.64	(Video) Luther: Ethan, move!
945	(Explosion)
952.68	Obviously, I have an obsession
952.68	with big crazy explosions.
955.56	So my favorite visual effect in the movie
955.56	is the one I'm about to show you.
959.16	It's a scene in which
959.16	Tom's character wakes up.
961.4	He's drowsy. He's crazy.
962.68	And the guy wakes up,
962.68	and he shoves this gun in his nose
965.36	and shoots this little capsule
965.36	into his brain
967.52	that he's going to use later
967.52	to kill him, as bad guys do.
976.4	(Video) Brownway: Good morning.
979.84	JJA: OK, now.
981.12	When we shot that scene,
982.36	the actor who had the gun,
982.36	an English actor, Eddie Marsan --
985.44	sweetheart, great guy --
986.68	he kept taking the gun
986.68	and putting it into Tom's nose,
989.28	and it was hurting Tom's nose.
990.8	And I learned this
990.8	very early on in my career:
993	Don't hurt Tom's nose.
994.28	(Laughter)
996.2	There are three things
996.2	you don't want to do.
998.32	Number two is: Don't hurt Tom's nose.
1000.16	So Eddie has this gun --
1000.16	and he's this sweet English guy.
1002.88	"He's like, ""Sorry,"
1002.88	"I don't want to hurt you."""
1005.04	"I'm like, ""We have to"
1005.04	"make this look good."""
1007.08	And I realized that we had to do something
1007.08	because it wasn't working.
1010.343	And I thought back
1010.343	to what I would have done
1012.6	using the Super 8 camera
1012.6	that my grandfather got me
1015.04	sitting in that room,
1016.28	and I realized that hand
1016.28	didn't have to be Eddie Marsan's.
1019.04	It could be Tom's.
1020.28	And Tom would know
1020.28	just how hard to push the gun.
1022.64	He wouldn't hurt himself.
1023.88	So we took his hand and we painted it
1023.88	to look a little bit more like Eddie's.
1027.56	We put it in Eddie's sleeve,
1029.44	and so the hand that you see --
1030.96	that's not Eddie's hand, that's Tom's.
1030.96	So Tom is playing two roles.
1034.16	(Laughter)
1035.6	And he didn't ask for any more money.
1037.44	So here, here. Watch it again.
1039.999	There he is. He's waking up.
1041.519	He's drowsy, been through a lot.
1047.56	(Video) Brownway: Good morning.
1049.16	JJA: Tom's hand. Tom's hand. Tom's hand.
1051.32	Anyway.
1052.56	So ...
1053.8	(Applause)
1057.2	Thanks.
1058.44	(Applause)
1060.519	So you don't need the greatest technology
1060.519	to do things that can work in movies.
1065.16	And the mystery box,
1065.16	in honor of my grandfather, stays closed.
1068.52	Thank you.
1069.76	(Applause)
