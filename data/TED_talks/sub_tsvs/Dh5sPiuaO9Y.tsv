13.44	In July of 1911,
16.16	a 35-year-old Yale graduate and professor
16.16	set out from his rainforest camp
21.44	with his team.
23.08	After climbing a steep hill
25.24	and wiping the sweat from his brow,
27.68	he described what he saw beneath him.
31	He saw rising from
31	the dense rainforest foliage
34.2	this incredible interlocking
34.2	maze of structures
37.8	built of granite,
39.12	beautifully put together.
41.36	What's amazing about this project
43	is that it was the first funded
43	by National Geographic,
46	and it graced the front cover
46	of its magazine in 1912.
50.64	This professor used state-of-the-art
50.64	photography equipment
54.8	to record the site,
56.48	forever changing the face of exploration.
60	The site was Machu Picchu,
62.96	discovered and explored by Hiram Bingham.
67.32	When he saw the site, he asked,
69.28	"""This is an impossible dream."
71.84	"What could it be?"""
74.36	So today,
79.28	I invite you all
79.28	on an incredible journey with me,
83.52	a 37-year-old Yale graduate and professor.
86.44	(Cheers)
88.6	We will do nothing less
88.6	than use state-of-the-art technology
92.04	to map an entire country.
95.76	This is a dream started by Hiram Bingham,
98.72	but we are expanding it to the world,
102.16	making archaeological exploration
102.16	more open, inclusive,
107.32	and at a scale simply
107.32	not previously possible.
111.2	This is why I am so excited
114.04	to share with you all today
116.16	that we will begin
116.16	the 2016 TED Prize platform
121.44	in Latin America,
123.64	more specifically Peru.
127.04	(Applause)
128.28	Thank you.
133.88	We will be taking
133.88	Hiram Bingham's impossible dream
137.52	and turning it into an amazing future
140.759	that we can all share in together.
143.64	So Peru doesn't just have Machu Picchu.
145.56	It has absolutely stunning jewelry,
148.56	like what you can see here.
150.4	It has amazing Moche pottery
150.4	of human figures.
154.44	It has the Nazca Lines
156.28	and amazing textiles.
158.8	So as part of the TED Prize platform,
161.68	we are going to partnering
161.68	with some incredible organizations,
164.76	first of all with DigitalGlobe,
164.76	the world's largest provider
168.24	of high-resolution
168.24	commercial satellite imagery.
171.36	They're going to be helping us build out
173.88	this amazing crowdsourcing
173.88	platform they have.
176.08	Maybe some of you used it
177.4	with the MH370 crash
177.4	and search for the airplane.
181.68	Of course, they'll also be providing us
181.68	with the satellite imagery.
184.88	National Geographic will be helping us
184.88	with education and of course exploration.
188.72	As well, they'll be providing us
188.72	with rich content for the platform,
192.16	including some of the archival imagery
192.16	like you saw at the beginning of this talk
196.16	and some of their documentary footage.
199.72	We've already begun
199.72	to build and plan the platform,
202.16	and I'm just so excited.
204.44	So here's the cool part.
205.92	My team, headed up by Chase Childs,
208.52	is already beginning to look
208.52	at some of the satellite imagery.
211.96	Of course, what you can see here
211.96	is 0.3-meter data.
215.2	This is site called Chan Chan
215.2	in northern Peru.
217.44	It dates to 850 AD.
219.44	It's a really amazing city,
219.44	but let's zoom in.
221.84	This is the type and quality of data
221.84	that you all will get to see.
226.24	You can see individual structures,
226.24	individual buildings.
229.28	And we've already begun
229.28	to find previously unknown sites.
232.68	What we can say already
232.68	is that as part of the platform,
235.36	you will all help discover
235.36	thousands of previously unknown sites,
239	like this one here,
240.52	and this potentially large one here.
242.84	Unfortunately, we've also begun
242.84	to uncover large-scale looting at sites,
247.32	like what you see here.
248.6	So many sites in Peru are threatened,
250.64	but the great part
250.64	is that all of this data
252.72	is going to be shared
252.72	with archaeologists on the front lines
255.76	of protecting these sites.
258.28	So I was just in Peru,
258.28	meeting with their Minister of Culture
261.72	as well as UNESCO.
263	We'll be collaborating closely with them.
265.2	Just so you all know,
266.48	the site is going to be
266.48	in both English and Spanish,
269.24	which is absolutely essential to make sure
271.279	that people in Peru and across
271.279	Latin America can participate.
275.24	Our main project coprincipal investigator
275.24	is the gentleman you see here,
279.32	Dr. Luis Jaime Castillo,
281.4	professor at Catholic University.
283.72	As a respected Peruvian archaeologist
283.72	and former vice-minister,
287.76	Dr. Castillo will be helping us coordinate
287.76	and share the data with archaeologists
291.92	so they can explore
291.92	these sites on the ground.
294.28	He also runs this amazing
294.28	drone mapping program,
297.68	some of the images of which
297.68	you can see behind me here and here.
300.76	And this data will be incorporated
300.76	into the platform,
303.6	and also he'll be helping to image
303.6	some of the new sites you help find.
308.24	Our on-the-ground partner
310.4	who will be helping us
310.4	with education, outreach,
313.6	as well as site preservation components,
315.529	is the Sustainable
315.529	Preservation Initiative,
317.553	led by Dr. Larry Coben.
319.32	Some of you may not be aware
320.72	that some of the world's
320.72	poorest communities
322.84	coexist with some of the world's
322.84	most well-known archaeological sites.
326.68	What SPI does
328.16	is it helps to empower these communities,
330.16	in particular women,
331.96	with new economic approaches
331.96	and business training.
335.08	So it helps to teach them
335.08	to create beautiful handicrafts
338.52	which are then sold on to tourists.
340.52	This empowers the women
340.52	to treasure their cultural heritage
344.72	and take ownership of it.
346.4	I had the opportunity to spend some time
346.4	with 24 of these women
350.36	at a well-known archaeological site
350.36	called Pachacamac, just outside Lima.
355	These women were unbelievably inspiring,
357.44	and what's great is that SPI
357.44	will help us transform communities
361.6	near some of the sites
361.6	that you help to discover.
364.8	Peru is just the beginning.
366.96	We're going to be expanding
366.96	this platform to the world,
369.6	but already I've gotten
369.6	thousands of emails
371.84	from people all across the world --
371.84	professors, educators, students,
375.52	and other archaeologists --
375.52	who are so excited to help participate.
379.08	In fact, they're already suggesting
379.08	amazing places for us to help discover,
383.72	including Atlantis.
385.6	I don't know if we're going
385.6	to be looking for Atlantis,
388.24	but you never know.
389.48	So I'm just so excited
389.48	to launch this platform.
392.6	It's going to be launched formally
392.6	by the end of the year.
395.4	And I have to say,
396.76	if what my team has already discovered
396.76	in the past few weeks are any indication,
402.64	what the world discovers
402.64	is just going to be beyond imagination.
407.08	Make sure to hold on to your alpacas.
410.16	Thank you very much.
411.52	(Applause)
413.36	Thank you.
414.6	(Applause)
