15.709	My passions
16.742	are music, technology and making things.
20.431	And it's the combination of these things
23.614	that has led me to the hobby of sound visualization,
26.31	and, on occasion, has led me to play with fire.
30.388	This is a Rubens' tube. It's one of many I've made over the years,
32.765	and I have one here tonight.
34.511	It's about an 8-foot-long tube of metal,
36.036	it's got a hundred or so holes on top,
37.371	on that side is the speaker, and here
39.124	is some lab tubing, and it's connected to this tank
41.3	of propane.
44.347	So, let's fire it up and see what it does.
53.147	So let's play a 550-herz frequency
55.038	and watch what happens.
56.602	(Frequency)
65.085	Thank you. (Applause)
67.798	It's okay to applaud the laws of physics,
69.786	but essentially what's happening here
71.242	-- (Laughter) --
73.002	is the energy from the sound via the air and gas molecules
77.01	is influencing the combustion properties of propane,
79.514	creating a visible waveform,
81.418	and we can see the alternating regions of compression
83.738	and rarefaction that we call frequency,
85.778	and the height is showing us amplitude.
87.522	So let's change the frequency of the sound,
89.85	and watch what happens to the fire.
91.275	(Higher frequency)
101.405	So every time we hit a resonant frequency we get a standing wave
104.755	and that emergent sine curve of fire.
106.455	So let's turn that off. We're indoors.
108.033	Thank you. (Applause)
113.624	I also have with me a flame table.
115.971	It's very similar to a Rubens' tube, and it's also used
117.536	for visualizing the physical properties of sound,
119.657	such as eigenmodes, so let's fire it up
121.625	and see what it does.
127.552	Ooh. (Laughter)
132.02	Okay. Now, while the table comes up to pressure,
134.994	let me note here that the sound is not traveling
136.666	in perfect lines. It's actually traveling in all directions,
139.412	and the Rubens' tube's a little like bisecting those waves
142.521	with a line, and the flame table's a little like
144.517	bisecting those waves with a plane,
146.371	and it can show a little more subtle complexity, which is why
150.371	I like to use it to watch Geoff Farina play guitar.
152.724	(Music)
195.005	All right, so it's a delicate dance.
196.77	If you watch closely â€” (Applause)
199.315	If you watch closely, you may have seen
202.082	some of the eigenmodes, but also you may have seen
204.554	that jazz music is better with fire.
209.171	Actually, a lot of things are better with fire in my world,
211.181	but the fire's just a foundation.
213.613	It shows very well that eyes can hear,
214.761	and this is interesting to me because
216.156	technology allows us to present sound to the eyes
219.01	in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes
221.873	for seeing sound, such as the removal of time.
224.57	So here, I'm using a rendering algorithm to paint
227.954	"the frequencies of the song ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"""
230.417	in a way that the eyes can take them in
232.457	as a single visual impression, and the technique
234.701	will also show the strengths of the visual cortex
236.674	for pattern recognition.
238.29	So if I show you another song off this album,
240.169	and another, your eyes will easily pick out
243.65	the use of repetition by the band Nirvana,
246.578	and in the frequency distribution, the colors,
248.435	you can see the clean-dirty-clean sound
251.483	that they are famous for,
252.69	and here is the entire album as a single visual impression,
256.69	and I think this impression is pretty powerful.
258.57	At least, it's powerful enough that
260.284	if I show you these four songs,
261.626	"and I remind you that this is ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"""
264.067	you can probably correctly guess, without listening
266.386	to any music at all, that the song
267.82	a die hard Nirvana fan would enjoy is this song,
270.114	"""I'll Stick Around"" by the Foo Fighters,"
272.37	whose lead singer is Dave Grohl,
274.37	who was the drummer in Nirvana.
278.148	The songs are a little similar, but mostly
279.448	I'm just interested in the idea that someday maybe
281.074	we'll buy a song because we like the way it looks.
285.486	All right, now for some more sound data.
286.586	This is data from a skate park,
289.238	and this is Mabel Davis skate park
291.27	in Austin, Texas. (Skateboard sounds)
293.412	And the sounds you're hearing came from eight
294.786	microphones attached to obstacles around the park,
297.002	and it sounds like chaos, but actually
299.186	all the tricks start with a very distinct slap,
302.533	but successful tricks end with a pop,
304.137	whereas unsuccessful tricks
305.93	more of a scratch and a tumble,
307.786	and tricks on the rail will ring out like a gong, and
311.796	voices occupy very unique frequencies in the skate park.
314.586	So if we were to render these sounds visually,
316.524	we might end up with something like this.
317.931	This is all 40 minutes of the recording,
320.387	and right away the algorithm tells us
322.547	a lot more tricks are missed than are made,
324.62	and also a trick on the rails is a lot more likely
326.955	to produce a cheer, and if you look really closely,
329.827	we can tease out traffic patterns.
331.56	You see the skaters often trick in this direction. The obstacles are easier.
337.647	And in the middle of the recording, the mics pick this up,
339.352	but later in the recording, this kid shows up,
342.156	and he starts using a line at the top of the park
345.084	to do some very advanced tricks on something
346.886	called the tall rail.
347.989	And it's fascinating. At this moment in time,
349.861	all the rest of the skaters turn their lines 90 degrees
353.364	to stay out of his way.
355.142	You see, there's a subtle etiquette in the skate park,
357.685	and it's led by key influencers,
359.285	and they tend to be the kids who can do the best tricks,
362.533	or wear red pants, and on this day the mics picked that up.
364.963	All right, from skate physics to theoretical physics.
368.864	I'm a big fan of Stephen Hawking,
370.48	and I wanted to use all eight hours
371.816	of his Cambridge lecture series to create an homage.
374.403	Now, in this series he's speaking with the aid of a computer,
377.467	which actually makes identifying the ends of sentences
380.571	fairly easy. So I wrote a steering algorithm.
383.997	It listens to the lecture, and then it uses
385.957	the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x-axis,
388.644	and it uses the inflection of sentences
391.277	to move a same point up and down on the y-axis.
393.431	And these trend lines, you can see, there's more questions
396.205	than answers in the laws of physics,
398.075	and when we reach the end of a sentence,
400.108	we place a star at that location.
402.443	So there's a lot of sentences, so a lot of stars,
405.243	and after rendering all of the audio, this is what we get.
407.599	This is Stephen Hawking's universe.
410.528	(Applause)
417.465	It's all eight hours of the Cambridge lecture series
419.952	taken in as a single visual impression,
421.8	and I really like this image,
423.557	but a lot of people think it's fake.
425.365	So I made a more interactive version,
427.709	and the way I did that is I used their position in time
433.165	in the lecture to place these stars into 3D space,
435.532	and with some custom software and a Kinect,
437.933	I can walk right into the lecture.
440.596	I'm going to wave through the Kinect here
442.396	and take control, and now I'm going to reach out
444.228	and I'm going to touch a star, and when I do,
447.467	it will play the sentence
449.411	that generated that star.
450.876	Stephen Hawking: There is one, and only one, arrangement
454.692	in which the pieces make a complete picture.
457.491	Jared Ficklin: Thank you. (Applause)
461.639	There are 1,400 stars.
464.812	It's a really fun way to explore the lecture,
466.476	and, I hope, a fitting homage.
467.943	All right. Let me close with a work in progress.
473.415	I think, after 30 years, the opportunity exists
476.398	to create an enhanced version of closed captioning.
478.502	Now, we've all seen a lot of TEDTalks online,
480.621	so let's watch one now with the sound turned off
483.548	and the closed captioning turned on.
487.47	There's no closed captioning for the TED theme song,
489.616	and we're missing it, but if you've watched enough of these,
491.729	you hear it in your mind's ear,
493.098	and then applause starts.
496.081	It usually begins here, and it grows and then it falls.
498.271	Sometimes you get a little star applause,
500.248	and then I think even Bill Gates takes a nervous breath,
502.734	and the talk begins.
504.424	All right, so let's watch this clip again.
510.122	This time, I'm not going to talk at all.
511.378	There's still going to be no audio,
512.745	but what I am going to do is I'm going to render the sound
514.649	visually in real time at the bottom of the screen.
518.965	So watch closely and see what your eyes can hear.
543.14	This is fairly amazing to me.
545.02	Even on the first view, your eyes will successfully
548.353	pick out patterns, but on repeated views,
551.441	your brain actually gets better
553.13	at turning these patterns into information.
554.786	You can get the tone and the timbre
556.377	and the pace of the speech,
557.6	things that you can't get out of closed captioning.
559.664	That famous scene in horror movies
561.848	where someone is walking up from behind
564.496	is something you can see,
566.456	and I believe this information would be something
569.16	that is useful at times when the audio is turned off
571.963	or not heard at all, and I speculate that deaf audiences
574.904	might actually even be better
576.081	at seeing sound than hearing audiences.
577.862	I don't know. It's a theory right now.
579.36	Actually, it's all just an idea.
580.881	And let me end by saying that sound moves in all directions,
585.072	and so do ideas.
587.049	Thank you. (Applause)
