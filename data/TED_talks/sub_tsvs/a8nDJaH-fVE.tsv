25	"I work with a species called ""Bonobo."""
28	And I'm happy most of the time,
30	because I think this is the happiest species on the planet.
33	It's kind of a well-kept secret.
36	This species lives only in the Congo.
38	And they're not in too many zoos, because of their sexual behavior.
44	Their sexual behavior is too human-like
46	for most of us to be comfortable with.
48	(Laughter)
49	But --
50	(Laughter)
51	actually, we have a lot to learn from them, because they're a very
56	egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society.
60	And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life
64	that they sort of set aside.
67	It permeates their entire life.
69	And it's used for communication.
72	And it's used for conflict resolution.
74	And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of,
78	divided our lives up into lots of parts.
81	We divided our world up with lots of categories.
85	And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit.
88	But I don't think that we were that way initially.
92	There are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired
96	and that there's something very, very special about man.
100	Maybe it's his ability to have causal thought.
104	Maybe it's something special in his brain
107	that allows him to have language.
109	Maybe it's something special in his brain
112	that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics.
117	Well, I don't know. There were Tasmanians who were discovered
123	around the 1600s and they had no fire.
127	They had no stone tools.
130	To our knowledge they had no music.
134	So when you compare them to the Bonobo,
139	the Bonobo is a little hairier.
141	He doesn't stand quite as upright.
146	But there are a lot of similarities.
149	And I think that as we look at culture,
153	we kind of come to understand
156	how we got to where we are.
158	And I don't really think it's in our biology;
161	I think we've attributed it to our biology,
163	but I don't really think it's there.
166	So what I want to do now is introduce you
168	to a species called the Bonobo.
172	This is Kanzi.
174	He's a Bonobo.
176	Right now, he's in a forest in Georgia.
179	His mother originally came from a forest in Africa.
183	And she came to us when she was just at puberty,
187	about six or seven years of age.
190	Now this shows a Bonobo on your right,
192	and a chimpanzee on your left.
194	Clearly, the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking.
198	The Bonobo, although shorter than us and their arms still longer,
202	is more upright, just as we are.
206	This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy.
211	As you can see, there's not a lot of difference
214	between the way a Bonobo walks
216	and the way an early australopithecine would have walked.
220	As they turn toward us you'll see
222	that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter
227	and doesn't have to rotate quite so much from side to side.
231	So the -- the bipedal gait is a little easier.
233	And now we see all four.
236	Video: Narrator: The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa, in the jungle
240	encircled by the Congo River.
245	Canopied trees as tall as 40 meters, 130 feet,
249	grow densely in the area.
253	It was a Japanese scientist
256	who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo,
260	almost three decades ago.
266	Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee.
270	Slim-bodied, Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures.
276	Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them.
283	One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally.
295	What's more, they are able to walk upright for long distances.
307	Susan Savage-Rumbaugh (video): Let's go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame.
311	SS: This is Kanzi and I, in the forest.
313	None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained.
317	None of them are tricks.
319	They all happened to be captured on film spontaneously,
322	by NHK of Japan.
325	We have eight Bonobos.
327	Video: Look at all this stuff that's here for our campfire.
330	SS: An entire family at our research centre.
338	Video: You going to help get some sticks?
342	Good.
347	We need more sticks, too.
356	I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one.
359	That's a wasps' nest.
361	You can get it out.
365	I hope I have a lighter.
368	You can use the lighter to start the fire.
372	SS: So Kanzi is very interested in fire.
374	He doesn't do it yet without a lighter,
377	but I think if he saw someone do it, he might be able to do --
381	make a fire without a lighter.
385	He's learning about how to keep a fire going.
388	He's learning the uses for a fire,
391	just by watching what we do with fire.
394	(Laughter)
403	This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo.
405	These are happy vocalizations.
407	Video: You're happy.
409	You're very happy about this part.
411	You've got to put some water on the fire. You see the water?
420	Good job.
423	SS: Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack.
427	But he likes to carry things from place to place.
430	"Video: Austin, I hear you saying ""Austin."""
432	SS: He talks to other Bonobos at the lab, long-distance,
435	farther than we can hear.
438	This is his sister.
440	This is her first time to try to drive a golf cart.
445	Video: Goodbye.
447	(Laughter)
449	SS: She's got the pedals down, but not the wheel.
457	She switches from reverse to forward
460	and she holds onto the wheel, rather than turns it.
462	(Laughter)
465	Like us, she knows that that individual in the mirror is her.
470	(Music)
474	Video: Narrator: By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human,
479	and documenting their development across two decades,
483	scientists are exploring how cultural forces
486	(Laughter)
487	may have operated during human evolution.
492	His name is Nyota.
494	"It means ""star"" in Swahili."
496	(Music)
506	Panbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors.
512	In the wild, the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring.
517	Here Panbanisha uses scissors, instead of her hands,
521	to groom Nyota.
525	Very impressive.
531	Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required
534	to perform delicate tasks like this.
546	Nyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself.
553	Realizing that Nyota might get hurt,
556	Panbanisha, like any human mother,
558	carefully tugs to get the scissors back.
577	He can now cut through tough animal hide.
581	SS: Kanzi's learned to make stone tools.
583	Video: Kanzi now makes his tools,
584	just as our ancestors may have made them,
586	two-and-a-half million years ago --
588	by holding the rocks in both hands, to strike one against the other.
593	He has learned that by using both hands
596	and aiming his glancing blows,
598	he can make much larger, sharper flakes.
602	Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough.
610	The tough hide is difficult to cut, even with a knife.
614	The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard
617	and ideal for stone tool making, but difficult to handle,
621	requiring great skill.
623	Kanzi's rock is from Gona, Ethiopia
625	and is identical to that used by our African ancestors
629	two-and-a-half million years ago.
634	These are the rocks Kanzi used
637	and these are the flakes he made.
639	The flat sharp edges are like knife blades.
644	Compare them to the tools our ancestors used;
647	they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's.
660	Panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods.
663	She keeps staring out the window.
668	SS: This is -- let me show you something we didn't think they would do.
671	Video: For several days now, Panbanisha has not been outside.
677	SS: I normally talk about language.
679	Video: Then Panbanisha does something unexpected.
682	SS: But since I'm advised not to do what I normally do,
685	I haven't told you that these apes have language.
687	It's a geometric language.
689	Video: She takes a piece of chalk
690	and begins writing something on the floor.
692	What is she writing?
700	SS: She's also saying the name of that, with her voice.
704	Video: Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again.
707	SS: These are her symbols on her keyboard.
710	(Music)
711	They speak when she touches them.
713	Video: Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go.
716	"""A frame"" represents a hut in the woods."
720	Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard.
734	Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor.
740	SS (video): Very nice. Beautiful, Panbanisha.
744	SS: At first we didn't really realize what she was doing,
747	until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it.
750	Video: This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods.
752	The curved line is very similar to the lexigram.
759	"The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents ""collar."""
763	It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out.
767	SS: That's an institutional requirement.
770	Video: This symbol is not as clear as the others,
773	but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line
778	and several straight lines.
780	Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said,
784	by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk.
788	Panbanisha watched.
790	Soon she began to write as well.
794	The Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world.
798	How did they develop?
800	SS (video): We found that the most important thing
802	for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them.
807	It's simply to use language around them,
810	because the driving force in language acquisition
813	is to understand what others, that are important to you, are saying to you.
818	Once you have that capacity,
820	the ability to produce language
823	comes rather naturally and rather freely.
827	So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos,
830	like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting --
834	we want to create an environment in which they have fun,
837	and an environment in which the others
839	are meaningful individuals for them.
844	Narrator: This environment brings out unexpected potential
847	in Kanzi and Panbanisha.
857	Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica,
861	until Nyota, now one year old, steals it.
865	Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth.
869	Is he looking for where the sound came from?
872	Dr. Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish.
887	This time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano.
890	She wasn't forced to learn the piano;
893	she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest.
925	Researcher: Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm listening.
929	Do that real fast part that you did. Yeah, that part.
936	Narrator: Kanzi plays the xylophone;
938	using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue's singing.
944	Kanzi and Panbanisha
945	are stimulated by this fun-filled environment,
948	which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities.
956	(Laughter)
966	Researcher: OK, now get the monsters. Get them.
969	Take the cherries too.
972	Now watch out, stay away from them now.
976	Now you can chase them again. Time to chase them.
983	Now you have to stay away. Get away.
986	Run away. Run.
989	Now we can chase them again. Go get them.
995	Oh no!
997	Good Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much.
1004	Narrator: None of us, Bonobo or human, can possibly even imagine?
1017	"SS: So we have a bi-species environment, we call it a ""panhomoculture."""
1024	We're learning how to become like them.
1026	We're learning how to communicate with them,
1028	in really high-pitched tones.
1030	We're learning that they probably have a language in the wild.
1034	And they're learning to become like us.
1036	Because we believe that it's not biology; it's culture.
1039	So we're sharing tools and technology and language
1043	with another species.
1045	Thank you.
