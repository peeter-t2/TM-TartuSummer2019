12.652	Probably a lot of you know
12.652	the story of the two salesmen
15.711	who went down to Africa in the 1900s.
18.653	They were sent down to find
18.653	if there was any opportunity
21.317	for selling shoes,
22.549	and they wrote telegrams
22.549	back to Manchester.
25.473	And one of them wrote,
26.735	"""Situation hopeless. Stop."
26.735	"They don't wear shoes."""
30.452	And the other one wrote,
32.088	"""Glorious opportunity."
32.088	"They don't have any shoes yet."""
35.12	(Laughter)
36.444	Now, there's a similar situation
36.444	in the classical music world,
39.627	because there are some people who think
39.627	that classical music is dying.
44.39	And there are some of us
44.39	who think you ain't seen nothing yet.
48.69	And rather than go
48.69	into statistics and trends,
52.16	and tell you about all the orchestras
52.16	that are closing,
54.921	and the record companies that are folding,
57.401	I thought we should do
57.401	an experiment tonight.
61.12	Actually, it's not really an experiment,
61.12	because I know the outcome.
64.503	(Laughter)
65.786	But it's like an experiment.
67.7	Now, before we start --
69.055	(Laughter)
72.16	Before we start, I need to do two things.
74.622	One is I want to remind you
74.622	of what a seven-year-old child
78.721	sounds like when he plays the piano.
80.756	Maybe you have this child at home.
82.889	He sounds something like this.
84.37	(Music)
102.555	(Music ends)
104.473	I see some of you recognize this child.
107.306	Now, if he practices for a year
107.306	and takes lessons, he's now eight
110.72	and he sounds like this.
111.926	(Music)
118.054	(Music ends)
119.269	He practices for another year
119.269	and takes lessons -- he's nine.
122.16	(Music)
127.323	(Music ends)
128.825	Then he practices for another year
128.825	and takes lessons -- now he's 10.
132.133	(Music)
136.84	(Music ends)
138.065	At that point, they usually give up.
139.842	(Laughter)
141.16	(Applause)
143.453	Now, if you'd waited for one more year,
143.453	you would have heard this.
147.16	(Music)
155.129	(Music ends)
156.589	Now, what happened was not
156.589	maybe what you thought,
159.793	which is, he suddenly
159.793	became passionate, engaged,
162.616	involved, got a new teacher,
162.616	he hit puberty, or whatever it is.
166.523	What actually happened
166.523	was the impulses were reduced.
170.045	You see, the first time, he was playing
170.045	with an impulse on every note.
173.666	(Music)
176.57	And the second,
176.57	with an impulse every other note.
178.942	(Music)
181.08	You can see it by looking at my head.
183	(Laughter)
184.74	The nine-year-old put
184.74	an impulse on every four notes.
188.036	(Music)
190.16	The 10-year-old, on every eight notes.
192.053	(Music)
194.16	And the 11-year-old,
194.16	one impulse on the whole phrase.
197.569	(Music)
200.312	I don't know how
200.312	we got into this position.
202.804	(Laughter)
204.87	"I didn't say, ""I'm going to move"
204.87	"my shoulder over, move my body."""
208.017	No, the music pushed me over,
209.631	which is why I call it
209.631	one-buttock playing.
211.98	(Music)
213.707	It can be the other buttock.
215.087	(Music)
218.548	You know, a gentleman was once
218.548	watching a presentation I was doing,
222.056	when I was working with a young pianist.
224	He was the president
224	of a corporation in Ohio.
226.359	I was working with
226.359	this young pianist, and said,
228.646	"""The trouble with you"
228.646	is you're a two-buttock player.
231.15	"You should be a one-buttock player."""
232.934	I moved his body while he was playing.
234.838	And suddenly, the music took off.
234.838	It took flight.
237.26	The audience gasped
237.26	when they heard the difference.
239.732	Then I got a letter from this gentleman.
241.732	"He said, ""I was so moved."
243.017	I went back and I transformed
243.017	my entire company
245.26	"into a one-buttock company."""
246.688	(Laughter)
250.16	Now, the other thing I wanted
250.16	to do is to tell you about you.
253.08	There are 1,600 people, I believe.
255.16	My estimation is that probably 45 of you
258.874	are absolutely passionate
258.874	about classical music.
261.784	You adore classical music.
261.784	Your FM is always on that classical dial.
266.53	You have CDs in your car,
266.53	and you go to the symphony,
269.16	your children are playing instruments.
271.08	You can't imagine your life
271.08	without classical music.
273.779	That's the first group, quite small.
275.827	Then there's another bigger group.
277.675	The people who don't mind classical music.
279.81	(Laughter)
280.844	You know, you've come home
280.844	from a long day,
282.913	and you take a glass of wine,
282.913	and you put your feet up.
285.62	A little Vivaldi in the background
285.62	doesn't do any harm.
288.264	That's the second group.
289.629	Now comes the third group:
290.961	people who never listen
290.961	to classical music.
293.185	It's just simply not part of your life.
295.16	You might hear it like second-hand
295.16	smoke at the airport ...
298.029	(Laughter)
299.16	-- and maybe a little bit
299.16	"of a march from ""Aida"""
301.47	when you come into the hall.
302.874	But otherwise, you never hear it.
304.485	That's probably the largest group.
306.144	And then there's a very small group.
307.913	These are the people
307.913	who think they're tone-deaf.
311.19	Amazing number of people think
311.19	they're tone-deaf.
313.509	Actually, I hear a lot,
313.509	"""My husband is tone-deaf."""
315.89	(Laughter)
316.915	Actually, you cannot be tone-deaf.
318.994	Nobody is tone-deaf.
320.24	If you were tone-deaf,
320.24	you couldn't change the gears
322.744	on your car, in a stick shift car.
324.647	You couldn't tell the difference between
326.584	somebody from Texas
326.584	and somebody from Rome.
329.324	And the telephone. The telephone.
331.142	If your mother calls
332.5	on the miserable telephone,
332.5	"she calls and says, ""Hello,"""
335.7	you not only know who it is,
335.7	you know what mood she's in.
339.001	You have a fantastic ear.
339.001	Everybody has a fantastic ear.
342.772	So nobody is tone-deaf.
344.694	But I tell you what.
345.869	It doesn't work for me
345.869	to go on with this thing,
348.847	with such a wide gulf
348.847	between those who understand,
352.617	love and are passionate
352.617	about classical music,
355.047	and those who have
355.047	no relationship to it at all.
357.793	The tone-deaf people,
357.793	they're no longer here.
360.3	But even between those three categories,
362.294	it's too wide a gulf.
363.622	So I'm not going to go on
363.622	until every single person in this room,
368.064	downstairs and in Aspen,
368.064	and everybody else looking,
372.779	will come to love
372.779	and understand classical music.
377.135	So that's what we're going to do.
378.867	Now, you notice that there is not
378.867	the slightest doubt in my mind
384.465	that this is going to work,
384.465	if you look at my face, right?
387.209	It's one of the characteristics
387.209	of a leader that he not doubt
391.16	for one moment the capacity
391.16	of the people he's leading
395.16	to realize whatever he's dreaming.
398.053	Imagine if Martin Luther King
398.053	"had said, ""I have a dream."
400.998	Of course, I'm not sure
400.998	"they'll be up to it."""
403.232	(Laughter)
406.16	All right. So I'm going
406.16	to take a piece of Chopin.
408.525	This is a beautiful prelude by Chopin.
411.358	Some of you will know it.
413.93	(Music)
443.278	Do you know what I think
443.278	probably happened here?
445.618	When I started, you thought,
445.618	"""How beautiful that sounds."""
448.32	(Music)
461.128	"""I don't think we should"
461.128	go to the same place
463.255	"for our summer holidays next year."""
465.084	(Laughter)
467.728	It's funny, isn't it?
469.117	It's funny how those thoughts
469.117	kind of waft into your head.
474.387	And of course --
475.641	(Applause)
477.525	Of course, if the piece is long
477.525	and you've had a long day,
480.36	you might actually drift off.
481.803	Then your companion
481.803	will dig you in the ribs
483.996	"and say, ""Wake up! It's culture!"""
483.996	And then you feel even worse.
487.051	(Laughter)
488.137	But has it ever occurred to you
488.137	that the reason you feel sleepy
491.15	in classical music is not
491.15	because of you, but because of us?
493.986	Did anybody think while I was playing,
495.847	"""Why is he using so many impulses?"""
497.831	If I'd done this with my head you
497.831	certainly would have thought it.
500.962	(Music)
506.708	(Music ends)
507.882	And for the rest of your life,
507.882	every time you hear classical music,
511.062	you'll always be able to know
511.062	if you hear those impulses.
515.253	So let's see what's really going on here.
517.26	We have a B. This is a B.
520.197	The next note is a C.
521.958	And the job of the C is to make the B sad.
524.16	And it does, doesn't it?
525.785	(Laughter)
527.557	Composers know that.
528.792	If they want sad music,
528.792	they just play those two notes.
531.395	(Music)
535.16	But basically, it's just a B,
535.16	with four sads.
537.715	(Laughter)
540.16	Now, it goes down to A.
543.055	Now to G.
544.62	And then to F.
545.87	So we have B, A, G, F.
548.535	And if we have B, A, G, F,
550.16	what do we expect next?
551.771	(Music)
555.35	That might have been a fluke.
556.772	Let's try it again.
557.958	(Music)
561.604	Oh, the TED choir.
562.906	(Laughter)
566.088	And you notice nobody is tone-deaf, right?
568.978	Nobody is.
570.204	You know, every village in Bangladesh
572.073	and every hamlet in China
572.073	-- everybody knows:
576.955	da, da, da, da -- da.
579.42	Everybody knows, who's expecting that E.
581.396	Chopin didn't want to reach the E there,
583.619	because what will have happened?
585.974	It will be over, like Hamlet.
585.974	Do you remember?
588.365	Act One, scene three,
589.597	he finds out his uncle killed his father.
591.639	He keeps on going up
591.639	to his uncle and almost killing him.
594.401	And then he backs away,
594.401	he goes up to him again, almost kills him.
597.592	The critics sitting in the back row there,
599.66	they have to have an opinion,
599.66	"so they say, ""Hamlet is a procrastinator."""
603.16	"Or they say, ""Hamlet has"
603.16	"an Oedipus complex."""
605.709	No, otherwise the play
605.709	would be over, stupid.
607.982	(Laughter)
609.091	That's why Shakespeare puts
609.091	all that stuff in Hamlet --
611.707	Ophelia going mad,
611.707	the play within the play,
613.796	and Yorick's skull, and the gravediggers.
615.78	That's in order to delay --
617.447	until Act Five, he can kill him.
619.106	It's the same with the Chopin.
621.041	He's just about to reach the E,
623.477	"and he says, ""Oops, better"
623.477	"go back up and do it again."""
626.731	So he does it again.
628.7	Now, he gets excited.
629.952	(Music)
632.169	That's excitement, don't worry about it.
634.16	Now, he gets to F-sharp,
634.16	and finally he goes down to E,
638.01	but it's the wrong chord --
639.32	because the chord
639.32	he's looking for is this one,
642.979	and instead he does ...
644.764	Now, we call that a deceptive cadence,
647.336	because it deceives us.
648.572	I tell my students,
648.572	"""If you have a deceptive cadence,"
651.087	raise your eyebrows,
651.087	"and everybody will know."""
653.33	(Laughter)
655.262	(Applause)
658.967	Right.
660.658	He gets to E, but it's the wrong chord.
662.604	Now, he tries E again.
663.823	That chord doesn't work.
665.309	Now, he tries the E again.
665.309	That chord doesn't work.
667.729	Now, he tries E again,
667.729	and that doesn't work.
670.284	And then finally ...
674.326	There was a gentleman
674.326	"in the front row who went, ""Mmm."""
677.203	(Laughter)
678.477	It's the same gesture
678.477	he makes when he comes home
681.857	after a long day, turns off
681.857	the key in his car and says,
684.567	"""Aah, I'm home."""
685.843	Because we all know where home is.
687.493	So this is a piece which goes
687.493	from away to home.
690.757	I'm going to play it all the way through
690.757	and you're going to follow.
693.98	B, C, B, C, B, C, B --
695.628	down to A, down to G, down to F.
697.344	Almost goes to E, but otherwise
697.344	the play would be over.
699.956	He goes back up to B,
699.956	he gets very excited.
701.995	Goes to F-sharp. Goes to E.
703.483	It's the wrong chord.
703.483	It's the wrong chord.
705.561	And finally goes to E, and it's home.
707.926	And what you're going to see
707.926	is one-buttock playing.
711.386	(Laughter)
713.16	Because for me, to join the B to the E,
716.36	I have to stop thinking
716.36	about every single note along the way,
722.303	and start thinking about the long,
722.303	long line from B to E.
727.668	You know, we were just in South Africa,
727.668	and you can't go to South Africa
732.196	without thinking of Mandela
732.196	in jail for 27 years.
735.483	What was he thinking about? Lunch?
737.698	No, he was thinking
737.698	about the vision for South Africa
741.16	and for human beings.
742.729	This is about vision.
742.729	This is about the long line.
745.706	Like the bird who flies over the field
747.991	and doesn't care about the fences
747.991	underneath, all right?
751.757	So now, you're going to follow
751.757	the line all the way from B to E.
754.876	And I've one last request before I play
754.876	this piece all the way through.
758.788	Would you think of somebody who you adore,
762.631	who's no longer there?
764.676	A beloved grandmother, a lover --
767.06	somebody in your life
767.06	who you love with all your heart,
771.207	but that person is no longer with you.
774.422	Bring that person into your mind,
776.408	and at the same time,
778.409	follow the line all the way from B to E,
781.891	and you'll hear everything
781.891	that Chopin had to say.
790.52	(Music)
897.239	(Music ends)
900.16	(Applause)
908.682	Now, you may be wondering --
910.7	(Applause)
915.83	(Applause ends)
917.004	You may be wondering why I'm clapping.
918.917	Well, I did this at a school in Boston
920.855	with about 70 seventh
920.855	graders, 12-year-olds.
924.639	I did exactly what I did with you,
926.437	and I explained the whole thing.
928.318	At the end, they went crazy, clapping.
930.16	I was clapping. They were clapping.
931.97	"Finally, I said, ""Why am I clapping?"""
933.852	And one of them said,
933.852	"""Because we were listening."""
936.21	(Laughter)
940.16	Think of it. 1,600 people, busy people,
943.378	involved in all sorts of different things,
945.742	listening, understanding and being moved
949.591	by a piece by Chopin.
951.671	Now, that is something.
952.941	Am I sure that every single
952.941	person followed that,
955.672	understood it, was moved by it?
957.291	Of course, I can't be sure.
958.616	But I'll tell you what happened
958.616	to me in Ireland
960.901	during the Troubles, 10 years ago,
962.576	and I was working with some Catholic
962.576	and Protestant kids
965.525	on conflict resolution.
967.98	And I did this with them --
969.686	a risky thing to do,
969.686	because they were street kids.
973.136	And one of them came to me
973.136	the next morning
975.649	and he said,
976.874	"""You know, I've never listened"
976.874	to classical music in my life,
979.771	but when you played
979.771	"that shopping piece ..."""
981.904	(Laughter)
983.698	"He said, ""My brother was shot last year"
983.698	and I didn't cry for him.
987.919	But last night,
987.919	when you played that piece,
989.967	he was the one I was thinking about.
992.672	And I felt the tears
992.672	streaming down my face.
994.764	And it felt really
994.764	"good to cry for my brother."""
997.886	So I made up my mind at that moment
1000.366	that classical music is for everybody.
1005.071	Everybody.
1007.16	Now, how would you walk --
1009.681	my profession, the music profession
1009.681	doesn't see it that way.
1013.934	They say three percent of the population
1013.934	likes classical music.
1017.173	If only we could move it to four percent,
1017.173	our problems would be over.
1020.451	(Laughter)
1021.514	How would you walk?
1021.514	How would you talk? How would you be?
1025.164	"If you thought, ""Three percent"
1025.164	of the population likes classical music,
1028.523	"if only we could move it to four percent."""
1030.547	How would you walk or talk?
1030.547	How would you be?
1032.688	"If you thought, ""Everybody"
1032.688	loves classical music --
1035.147	"they just haven't found out about it yet."""
1037.563	See, these are totally different worlds.
1040.547	Now, I had an amazing experience.
1042.846	I was 45 years old,
1044.112	I'd been conducting for 20 years,
1045.919	and I suddenly had a realization.
1048.93	The conductor of an orchestra
1048.93	doesn't make a sound.
1052.638	My picture appears
1052.638	on the front of the CD --
1055.019	(Laughter)
1057.945	But the conductor doesn't make a sound.
1059.97	He depends, for his power,
1061.817	on his ability to make
1061.817	other people powerful.
1065.645	And that changed everything for me.
1067.573	It was totally life-changing.
1069.33	People in my orchestra said,
1070.867	"""Ben, what happened?"""
1070.867	That's what happened.
1073.123	I realized my job was to awaken
1073.123	possibility in other people.
1078.853	And of course, I wanted to know
1078.853	whether I was doing that.
1081.586	How do you find out?
1082.799	You look at their eyes.
1084.134	If their eyes are shining,
1084.134	you know you're doing it.
1088.033	You could light up a village
1088.033	with this guy's eyes.
1090.42	(Laughter)
1091.46	Right. So if the eyes are shining,
1091.46	you know you're doing it.
1094.733	If the eyes are not shining,
1094.733	you get to ask a question.
1097.445	And this is the question:
1098.875	who am I being
1101.463	that my players' eyes are not shining?
1103.756	We can do that with our children, too.
1105.637	Who am I being,
1108.533	that my children's eyes are not shining?
1111.223	That's a totally different world.
1113.635	Now, we're all about to end
1113.635	this magical, on-the-mountain week,
1118.724	we're going back into the world.
1120.995	And I say, it's appropriate
1120.995	for us to ask the question,
1124.764	who are we being as we go back
1124.764	out into the world?
1129.731	And you know, I have
1129.731	a definition of success.
1132.105	For me, it's very simple.
1133.365	It's not about wealth and fame and power.
1135.395	It's about how many shining eyes
1135.395	I have around me.
1138.374	So now, I have one last thought,
1140.758	which is that it really makes
1140.758	a difference what we say --
1145.114	the words that come out of our mouth.
1147.669	I learned this from a woman
1147.669	who survived Auschwitz,
1150.465	one of the rare survivors.
1151.957	She went to Auschwitz
1151.957	when she was 15 years old.
1156.163	And ...
1159.151	And her brother was eight,
1161.191	and the parents were lost.
1163.944	And she told me this, she said,
1168.336	"""We were in the train going to Auschwitz,"
1170.812	and I looked down and saw
1170.812	my brother's shoes were missing.
1174.255	I said, 'Why are you so stupid,
1174.255	can't you keep your things together
1177.589	"for goodness' sake?'"""
1178.831	The way an elder sister might speak
1178.831	to a younger brother.
1183.445	Unfortunately, it was the last
1183.445	thing she ever said to him,
1186.184	because she never saw him again.
1187.732	He did not survive.
1189.532	And so when she came out
1189.532	of Auschwitz, she made a vow.
1192.388	She told me this.
1193.642	"She said, ""I walked out"
1193.642	of Auschwitz into life
1197.086	and I made a vow.
1198.865	And the vow was,
1200.117	"""I will never say anything that couldn't"
1200.117	"stand as the last thing I ever say."""
1206.733	Now, can we do that? No.
1208.354	And we'll make ourselves wrong
1208.354	and others wrong.
1212.337	But it is a possibility to live into.
1215.781	Thank you.
1217.095	(Applause)
1223.639	Shining eyes.
1225.079	(Applause)
1226.52	Shining eyes.
1227.92	(Applause)
1234.16	Thank you, thank you.
