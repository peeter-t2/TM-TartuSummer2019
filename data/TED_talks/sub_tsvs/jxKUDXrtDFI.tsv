13.167	Thank you.
14.474	I have only got 18 minutes
15.983	to explain something 
15.983	that lasts for hours and days,
18.832	so I'd better get started.
21.102	Let's start with a clip
21.102	from Al Jazeera's Listening Post.
26.649	Richard Gizbert: Norway is a country that 
26.649	gets relatively little media coverage.
30.496	Even the elections this past week
30.496	passed without much drama.
33.487	And that's the Norwegian
33.487	media in a nutshell:
36.145	not much drama.
37.622	A few years back,
38.959	Norway's public TV channel NRK
41.416	decided to broadcast live coverage
41.416	of a seven-hour train ride --
45.593	seven hours of simple footage,
47.894	a train rolling down the tracks.
50.123	Norwegians, more than a million of them
50.123	according to the ratings, loved it.
53.985	A new kind of reality TV show was born,
56.901	and it goes against all the rules
56.901	of TV engagement.
60.036	There is no story line, no script,
62.476	no drama, no climax,
64.519	and it's called Slow TV.
66.443	For the past two months,
67.915	Norwegians have been watching 
67.915	a cruise ship's journey up the coast,
71.507	and there's a lot of fog on that coast.
73.566	Executives at Norway's
73.566	National Broadcasting Service
76.639	are now considering broadcasting
76.639	a night of knitting nationwide.
80.729	On the surface, it sounds boring,
83.21	because it is,
84.51	but something about this TV experiment
86.6	has gripped Norwegians.
88.458	So we sent the Listening Post's
88.458	Marcela Pizarro to Oslo
91.615	to find out what it is,
91.615	but first a warning:
94.146	Viewers may find some of the images
94.146	in the following report disappointing.
98.649	(Laughter)
100.034	Thomas Hellum: And then follows
100.034	an eight-minute story on Al Jazeera
103.55	about some strange
103.55	TV programs in little Norway.
106.876	Al Jazeera. CNN. How did we get there?
109.934	We have to go back to 2009,
111.954	when one of my colleagues
111.954	got a great idea.
113.953	Where do you get your ideas?
115.756	In the lunchroom.
117.737	So he said, why don't we make
117.737	a radio program
120.714	marking the day of the German invasion
120.714	of Norway in 1940.
124.299	We tell the story at the exact time
124.299	during the night.
128.343	Wow. Brilliant idea, except
130.507	this was just a couple of weeks
130.507	before the invasion day.
133.41	So we sat in our lunchroom and discussed
135.755	what other stories
135.755	can you tell as they evolve?
139.963	What other things take a really long time?
144.421	So one of us came up with a train.
146.737	The Bergen Railway had its 
150.729	It goes from western Norway
150.729	to eastern Norway,
153.424	and it takes exactly the same time
153.424	as it did 40 years ago,
157.587	over seven hours. (Laughter)
160.785	So we caught our commissioning editors 
160.785	in Oslo, and we said,
163.771	we want to make a documentary
163.771	about the Bergen Railway,
166.758	and we want to make it in full length,
168.71	and the answer was,
170.064	"""Yes, but how long will the program be?"""
171.999	"""Oh,"" we said, ""full length."""
173.857	"""Yes, but we mean the program."""
175.349	And back and forth.
177.456	Luckily for us, they met us with laughter,
177.456	very, very good laughter,
182.943	so one bright day in September,
185.629	we started a program that we thought
185.629	should be seven hours and four minutes.
189.615	Actually, it turned out
189.615	to be seven hours and 14 minutes
192.479	due to a signal failure
192.479	at the last station.
196.983	We had four cameras,
198.957	three of them pointing out
198.957	to the beautiful nature.
202.263	Some talking to the guests,
202.263	some information.
206.233	(Video) Train announcement: 
206.233	We will arrive at Haugastøl Station.
210.283	TH: And that's about it,
211.651	but of course, also
213.446	the 160 tunnels gave us the opportunity
213.446	to do some archives.
217.287	Narrator [in Norwegian]: Then a bit of
217.287	flirting while the food is digested.
222.483	The last downhill stretch
222.483	before we reach our destination.
227.901	We pass Mjølfjell Station.
232.207	Then a new tunnel.
234.615	(Laughter)
235.765	TH: And now we thought, yes,
235.765	we have a brilliant program.
239.022	It will fit for the 2,000
239.022	train spotters in Norway.
243.619	We brought it on air in November 2009.
246.22	But no, this was far more attractive.
248.667	This is the five biggest TV channels
248.667	in Norway on a normal Friday,
252.489	and if you look at NRK2 over here,
254.788	look what happened when they put on
254.788	the Bergen Railway show:
258.984	1.2 million Norwegians
258.984	watched part of this program.
262.709	(Applause)
266.624	And another funny thing:
268.81	When the host on our main channel,
270.757	after they have got news for you,
273.224	"she said, ""And on our second channel,"
275.662	the train has now
275.662	"nearly reached Myrdal station."""
278.657	Thousands of people
278.657	just jumped on the train
281.35	on our second channel like this.
281.35	(Laughter)
285.366	This was also a huge success
285.366	in terms of social media.
289.012	It was so nice to see all the thousands
289.012	of Facebook and Twitter users
293.116	discussing the same view,
295.977	talking to each other as if they were
295.977	on the same train together.
300.463	And especially, I like this one.
300.463	It's a 76-year-old man.
303.748	He's watched all the program,
305.428	and at the end station, he rises up
305.428	to pick up what he thinks is his luggage,
309.445	and his head hit the curtain rod,
313.003	and he realized he is
313.003	in his own living room.
315.691	(Applause)
321.426	So that's strong and living TV.
326.07	Four hundred and thirty-six
326.07	minute by minute on a Friday night,
329.414	and during that first night,
331.275	the first Twitter message came:
331.275	Why be a chicken?
333.829	Why stop at 436
333.829	when you can expand that
339.498	to 8,040, minute by minute,
343.159	and do the iconic journey in Norway,
345.365	the coastal ship journey Hurtigruten
345.365	from Bergen to Kirkenes,
348.807	almost 3,000 kilometers,
348.807	covering most of our coast.
352.361	It has 120-year-old,
352.361	very interesting history,
356.939	and literally takes part in life
356.939	and death along the coast.
361.755	So just a week after the Bergen Railway,
364.126	we called the Hurtigruten company
364.126	and we started planning for our next show.
370.082	We wanted to do something different.
372.245	The Bergen Railway was a recorded program.
375.526	So when we sat in our editing room,
377.616	we watched this picture --
377.616	it's all Ål Station --
380.22	we saw this journalist.
381.728	We had called him, we had spoken to him,
383.681	and when we left the station,
385.537	he took this picture of us
385.537	and he waved to the camera,
388.728	and we thought,
390.188	what if more people knew
390.188	that we were on board that train?
393.44	Would more people show up?
395.286	What would it look like?
397.259	So we decided our next project,
397.259	it should be live.
400.789	We wanted this picture of us on the fjord
400.789	and on the screen at the same time.
407.034	So this is not the first time
407.034	NRK had been on board a ship.
410.355	This is back in 1964,
412.073	when the technical managers
412.073	have suits and ties
414.929	and NRK rolled all its equipment
414.929	on board a ship,
418.969	and 200 meters out of the shore,
418.969	transmitting the signal back,
423.009	and in the machine room,
423.009	they talked to the machine guy,
426.957	and on the deck, they have
426.957	splendid entertainment.
431.11	So being on a ship, 
431.11	it's not the first time.
437.309	But five and a half days in a row,
437.309	and live, we wanted some help.
442.335	And we asked our viewers out there,
442.335	what do you want to see?
446.498	What do you want us to film?
446.498	How do you want this to look?
450.61	Do you want us to make a website?
450.61	What do you want on it?
453.318	And we got some answers
453.318	from you out there,
455.556	and it helped us a very lot
455.556	to build the program.
459.807	So in June 2011,
	the Hurtigruten coastal ship
466.446	and we set off.
468.164	(Music)
527.373	I have some really strong memories
527.373	from that week, and it's all about people.
531.092	This guy, for instance,
532.732	he's head of research
532.732	at the University in Tromsø
535.425	(Laughter)
537.188	And I will show you a piece of cloth,
542.071	this one.
546.378	It's the other strong memory.
547.922	It belongs to a guy called Erik Hansen.
552.796	And it's people like those two
552.796	who took a firm grip of our program,
560.818	and together with thousands
560.818	of others along the route,
564.639	they made the program what it became.
567.519	They made all the stories.
570.047	This is Karl. He's in the ninth grade.
573.091	"It says, ""I will be a little"
573.091	"late for school tomorrow."""
576.713	He was supposed to be
576.713	in the school at 8 a.m.
579.383	He came at 9 a.m., and he didn't
579.383	get a note from his teacher,
582.484	because the teacher
582.484	had watched the program.
584.585	(Laughter)
586.046	How did we do this?
587.719	Yes, we took a conference room
587.719	on board the Hurtigruten.
590.935	We turned it into
590.935	a complete TV control room.
594.047	We made it all work, of course,
597.1	and then we took along 11 cameras.
599.259	This is one of them.
600.374	This is my sketch from February,
602.347	and when you give this sketch
602.347	to professional people
604.855	in the Norwegian broadcasting company NRK,
607.084	you get some cool stuff back.
610.024	And with some very creative solutions.
614.201	(Video) Narrator [in Norwegian]: 
614.201	Run it up and down.
616.719	This is Norway's most
616.719	important drill right now.
620.141	It regulates the height of a bow
620.141	camera in NRK's live production,
626.054	one of 11 that capture
626.054	great shots from the MS Nord-Norge.
630.79	Eight wires keep the camera stable.
633.461	Cameraman: I work 
633.461	on different camera solutions.
637.106	They're just tools
637.106	used in a different context.
640.96	TH: Another camera is this one.
640.96	It's normally used for sports.
644.304	It made it possible for us to take
644.304	close-up pictures of people
649.923	like this one. (Laughter)
654.358	People called us and asked,
654.358	how is this man doing?
657.19	He's doing fine. Everything went well.
660.139	We also could take pictures of
660.139	people waving at us,
663.372	people along the route,
663.372	thousands of them,
665.689	and they all had a phone in their hand.
668.114	And when you take a picture of them,
668.114	and they get the message,
671.099	"""Now we are on TV, dad,"""
671.099	they start waving back.
673.954	This was waving TV 
673.954	for five and a half days,
676.114	and people get so extremely happy
678.273	when they can send a warm message
678.273	to their loved ones.
683.09	It was also a great success
683.09	on social media.
686.609	On the last day, we met
686.609	Her Majesty the Queen of Norway,
689.418	and Twitter couldn't quite handle it.
693.017	And we also, on the web,
695.386	during this week we streamed
695.386	more than 100 years of video
700.26	to 148 nations,
703.628	and the websites are still there
703.628	and they will be forever, actually,
707.829	because Hurtigruten was selected
709.735	to be part of the Norwegian
709.735	UNESCO list of documents,
714.267	and it's also in
714.267	the Guinness Book of Records
717.258	as the longest documentary ever.
720.764	(Applause)
724.247	Thank you.
727.985	But it's a long program,
731.375	so some watched part of it,
731.375	like the Prime Minister.
734.463	Some watched a little bit more.
736.205	"It says, ""I haven't used"
736.205	"my bed for five days."""
740.614	And he's 82 years old,
740.614	and he hardly slept.
745.085	He kept watching because
745.085	something might happen,
748.441	though it probably won't. (Laughter)
750.854	This is the number
750.854	of viewers along the route.
753.503	You can see the famous Trollfjord
755.105	and a day after, all-time high for NRK2.
759.849	If you see the four biggest
759.849	channels in Norway during June 2011,
765.671	they will look like this,
767.968	and as a TV producer, it's a pleasure
767.968	to put Hurtigruten on top of it.
771.818	It looks like this:
773.541	3.2 million Norwegians
773.541	watched part of this program,
776.908	and we are only five million here.
778.788	Even the passengers on board
778.788	the Hurtigruten coastal ship --
781.822	(Laughter) --
783.436	they chose to watched the telly
783.436	instead of turning 90 degrees
787.561	and watching out the window.
790.435	So we were allowed to be 
790.435	part of people's living room
793.416	with this strange TV program,
796.173	with music, nature, people.
799.546	And Slow TV was now a buzzword,
802.239	and we started looking for other things
802.239	we could make Slow TV about.
806.073	So we could either take something long
806.073	and make it a topic,
809.515	like with the railway and the Hurtigruten,
811.736	or we could take a topic and make it long.
814.267	This is the last project.
814.267	It's the peep show.
816.775	It's 14 hours of birdwatching
816.775	on a TV screen,
819.561	actually 87 days on the web.
822.742	We have made 18 hours
822.742	of live salmon fishing.
826.364	It actually took three hours
826.364	before we got the first fish,
829.429	and that's quite slow.
831.24	We have made 12 hours of boat ride
831.24	into the beautiful Telemark Canal,
836.276	and we have made another train ride
836.276	with the northern railway,
839.821	and because this we couldn't do live,
839.821	we did it in four seasons
843.823	just to give the viewer
843.823	another experience on the way.
849.058	So our next project got us
849.058	some attention outside Norway.
853.598	This is from the Colbert Report
853.598	on Comedy Central.
856.484	(Video) Stephen Colbert: I've got my eye
856.484	on a wildly popular program from Norway
860.28	"called ""National Firewood Night,"""
863.213	which consisted of mostly people in parkas
863.213	chatting and chopping in the woods,
867.485	and then eight hours of a fire 
867.485	burning in a fireplace. (Laughter)
871.13	It destroyed the other 
871.13	top Norwegian shows,
873.731	"like ""So You Think"
873.731	"You Can Watch Paint Dry"""
876.146	"and ""The Amazing Glacier Race."""
879.977	And get this, almost 20 percent
879.977	of the Norwegian population tuned in,
886.85	TH: So, when wood fire and wood chopping
886.85	can be that interesting,
890.727	why not knitting?
892.26	So on our next project,
893.978	we used more than eight hours
893.978	to go live from a sheep to a sweater,
898.995	and Jimmy Kimmel in the ABC show,
901.302	he liked that.
903.451	(Music)
910.324	(Video) Jimmy Kimmel: Even the people
910.324	on the show are falling asleep,
914.044	and after all that,
914.044	the knitters actually failed
916.32	to break the world record.
917.996	They did not succeed,
919.342	but remember the old Norwegian saying,
921.585	it's not whether you win
921.585	or lose that counts.
923.763	In fact, nothing counts, 
923.763	and death is coming for us all.
926.487	(Laughter)
927.931	TH: Exactly. So why does this stand out?
930.825	This is so completely different
930.825	to other TV programming.
934.105	We take the viewer on a journey
934.105	that happens right now in real time,
938.847	and the viewer gets the feeling
938.847	of actually being there,
942.424	actually being on the train, on the boat,
944.588	and knitting together with others,
946.415	and the reason I think
946.415	why they're doing that
948.872	is because we don't edit the timeline.
951.352	It's important that
951.352	we don't edit the timeline,
953.72	and it's also important
953.72	that what we make Slow TV about
956.919	is something that we all can relate to,
956.919	that the viewer can relate to,
961.648	and that somehow has 
961.648	a root in our culture.
964.765	This is a picture from last summer
966.491	when we traveled the coast
966.491	again for seven weeks.
969.068	And of course this is a lot of planning,
969.068	this is a lot of logistics.
973.431	So this is the working plan
973.431	for 150 people last summer,
977.543	but more important is what you don't plan.
980.388	You don't plan what's going to happen.
982.905	You have to just
982.905	take your cameras with you.
985.891	It's like a sports event.
987.411	You rig them and you see what's happening.
989.57	So this is actually
989.57	the whole running order
992.054	for Hurtigruten, 134 hours,
992.054	just written on one page.
996.501	We didn't know anything more
996.501	when we left Bergen.
1000.553	So you have to let the viewers
1000.553	make the stories themselves,
1003.897	and I'll give you an example of that.
1006.126	This is from last summer,
1007.89	and as a TV producer,
1009.748	it's a nice picture, but now
1009.748	you can cut to the next one.
1013.395	But this is Slow TV,
1015.135	so you have to keep this picture until 
1015.135	it really starts hurting your stomach,
1018.809	and then you keep it a little bit longer,
1021.169	and when you keep it that long,
1022.689	I'm sure some of you now
1022.689	have noticed the cow.
1025.453	Some of you have seen the flag.
1027.487	Some of you start wondering,
1027.487	is the farmer at home?
1029.893	Has he left? Is he watching the cow?
1032.34	And where is that cow going?
1035.567	So my point is, the longer
1035.567	you keep a picture like this,
1038.801	and we kept it for 10 minutes,
1041.093	you start making
1041.093	the stories in your own head.
1045.064	That's Slow TV.
1049.267	So we think that Slow TV is
1049.267	one nice way of telling a TV story,
1054.677	and we think that we
1054.677	can continue doing it,
1057.161	not too often, once or twice a year,
1057.161	so we keep the feeling of an event,
1061.665	and we also think that
1061.665	the good Slow TV idea,
1064.568	that's the idea when people say,
1066.24	"""Oh no, you can't put that on TV."""
1069.676	When people smile, it might be
1069.676	a very good slow idea,
1072.718	so after all, life is best
1072.718	when it's a bit strange.
1076.97	Thank you.
1078.463	(Applause)
