26.031	"(Music: ""The Sound of Silence,"""
26.031	Simon &amp; Garfunkel)
28.539	Hello voice mail, my old friend.
31	(Laughter)
32.687	I've called for tech support again.
36.568	I ignored my boss's warning.
40.197	I called on a Monday morning.
43.537	Now it's evening, and my dinner
43.537	first grew cold, and then grew mold.
49.679	I'm still on hold.
51.977	I'm listening to the sounds of silence.
57.585	I don't think you understand.
60.666	I think your phone lines are unmanned.
64.516	I punched every touch tone I was told,
67.812	but I've still spent 18 hours on hold.
70.999	It's not enough your software
70.999	crashed my Mac,
74	and it constantly hangs and bombs --
77.561	it erased my ROMs!
80.145	Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence.
85.309	In my dreams I fantasize
88.666	of wreaking vengeance on you guys.
92.265	Say your motorcycle crashes.
95.764	Blood comes gushing from your gashes.
99.095	With your fading strength, you call 9-1-1
99.095	and you pray for a trained MD.
105.702	But you get me.
107.346	(Laughter)
108.813	And you listen to the sounds of silence.
113.035	(Music)
115.948	(Applause)
118.17	Thank you.
119.345	Good evening and welcome to:
120.717	"""Spot the TED Presenter Who Used"
120.717	"to Be a Broadway Accompanist."""
123.729	(Laughter)
124.891	When I was offered the Times
124.891	column six years ago,
128.43	the deal was like this:
129.662	you'll be sent the coolest, hottest,
129.662	slickest new gadgets.
133.065	Every week, it'll arrive at your door.
135	You get to try them out,
135	play with them, evaluate them
137.677	until the novelty wears out,
137.677	before you have to send them back,
140.773	and you'll get paid for it.
142.124	You can think about it, if you want.
144.646	So, I've always been a technology nut,
144.646	and I absolutely love it.
149.295	The job, though, came with one
149.295	small downside, and that is,
152.256	they intended to publish my email address
152.256	at the end of every column.
157.84	And what I've noticed is -- first of all,
157.84	you get an incredible amount of email.
163.079	If you ever are feeling lonely,
164.838	get a New York Times column,
166.242	because you will get hundreds
166.242	and hundreds and hundreds of emails.
169.4	And the email I'm getting a lot
169.4	today is about frustration.
173	People are feeling like things --
176.373	Ok, I just had an alarm
176.373	come up on my screen.
178.707	Lucky you can't see it.
180.12	People are feeling overwhelmed.
181.643	They're feeling like
181.643	it's too much technology, too fast.
184.287	It may be good technology,
186	but I feel like there's not enough
186	of a support structure.
189.012	There's not enough help.
190.618	There's not enough thought
190.618	put into the design of it
193.088	to make it easy and enjoyable to use.
195.042	One time I wrote a column about my efforts
195.042	to reach Dell Technical Support,
199.054	and within 12 hours,
199.054	there were 700 messages
203.167	from readers on the feedback boards
203.167	on the Times website,
206.382	from users saying,
208.298	"""""Me too, and here's my tale of woe."""
210.736	"I call it ""software rage."""
213.146	And man, let me tell you,
214.369	whoever figures out how to make money
214.369	off of this frustration will --
218.816	Oh, how did that
218.816	get up there? Just kidding.
221.121	(Laughter)
222.293	Ok, so why is the problem accelerating?
225.196	And part of the problem is, ironically,
227.185	because the industry
227.185	has put so much thought
229.304	into making things easier to use.
231.281	I'll show you what I mean.
232.906	This is what the computer
232.906	interface used to look like, DOS.
237.365	Over the years, it's gotten easier to use.
240.223	This is the original Mac operating system.
242.803	Reagan was President.
242.803	Madonna was still a brunette.
245.938	And the entire operating system --
247.691	this is the good part -- the entire
247.691	operating system fit in 211 k.
252.875	You couldn't put
252.875	the Mac OS X logo in 211 k!
256.001	(Laughter)
257.637	So the irony is, that as these
257.637	things became easier to use,
261.464	a less technical, broader audience
261.464	was coming into contact
265.344	with this equipment for the first time.
267.313	I once had the distinct privilege
267.313	of sitting in on the Apple call center
273.002	for a day.
274.186	The guy had a duplicate headset
274.186	for me to listen to.
277	And the calls that --
277	you know how they say,
280.55	"""Your call may be recorded"
280.55	"for quality assurance?"""
283.304	Uh-uh.
284.597	Your call may be recorded
286	so that they can collect
286	the funniest dumb user stories
288.692	and pass them around on a CD.
290.207	(Laughter)
291.271	Which they do.
293	(Laughter)
294.616	And I have a copy.
295.862	(Laughter)
296.909	It's in your gift bag. No, no.
299.027	With your voices on it!
301.222	So, some of the stories are just
301.222	so classic, and yet so understandable.
306.405	A woman called Apple to complain
306.405	that her mouse was squeaking.
309.772	Making a squeaking noise.
311.018	And the technician said,
312.212	"""Well, ma'am, what do you mean"
312.212	"your mouse is squeaking?"""
314.887	"She says, ""All I can tell you"
314.887	is that it squeaks louder,
317.554	"the faster I move it across the screen."""
320.188	(Laughter)
322.283	And the technician's like,
323.569	"""Ma'am, you've got the mouse"
323.569	"up against the screen?"""
326.743	"She goes, ""Well, the message said,"
326.743	"'Click here to continue.'"""
329.86	(Laughter)
332.949	Well, if you like that one --
332.949	how much time have we got?
336.822	Another one, a guy called --
336.822	this is absolutely true --
339.518	his computer had crashed,
339.518	and he told the technician
342	he couldn't restart it, no matter
342	"how many times he typed ""11."""
346.218	And the technician said,
346.218	"""What? Why are you typing 11?"""
349.392	"He said, ""The message says,"
349.392	"'Error Type 11.'"""
353	(Laughter)
357.399	So, we must admit
360.328	that some of the blame falls squarely
360.328	at the feet of the users.
365.573	But why is the technical overload crisis,
368	the complexity crisis, accelerating now?
370.604	In the hardware world, it's because
370.604	we the consumers want
373.407	everything to be smaller,
373.407	smaller, smaller.
375.615	So the gadgets are getting
375.615	tinier and tinier,
378.202	but our fingers are essentially
378.202	staying the same size.
380.829	So it gets to be more and more
380.829	of a challenge.
383	Software is subject
383	to another primal force:
385.12	the mandate to release
385.12	more and more versions.
387.733	When you buy a piece of software,
389.353	it's not like buying a vase
389.353	or a candy bar, where you own it.
392.265	It's more like joining a club,
392.265	where you pay dues every year,
395.657	and every year, they say,
396.936	"""We've added more features,"
396.936	"and we'll sell it to you for $99."""
401	I know one guy who's spent $4,000
401	just on Photoshop over the years.
406	And software companies make
408.863	from just these software upgrades.
410.643	I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox --
413.542	which is that if you improve
413.542	a piece of software enough times,
417.415	you eventually ruin it.
418.934	I mean, Microsoft Word was last
418.934	just a word processor in, you know,
423.123	the Eisenhower administration.
424.713	(Laughter)
425.785	But what's the alternative?
427.172	Microsoft actually did this experiment.
429.208	"They said, ""Well, wait a minute."
430.78	Everyone complains that
430.78	we're adding so many features.
433.352	Let's create a word processor
433.352	that's just a word processor:
436.175	Simple, pure; does not do web pages,
436.175	"is not a database."""
439.428	And it came out,
439.428	and it was called Microsoft Write.
442.858	And none of you are nodding
442.858	in acknowledgment, because it died.
446	It tanked. No one ever bought it.
448	I call this the Sport Utility Principle.
450.427	People like to surround themselves
450.427	with unnecessary power, right?
454.691	They don't need the database
454.691	and the website, but they're like,
458.024	"""Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might,"
458.024	"you know, I might need that someday."""
462	So the problem is: as you add more
462	features, where are they going to go?
465.582	Where are you going to stick them?
465.582	You only have so many design tools.
469.746	You can do buttons, you can do
469.746	sliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus.
473.762	But if you're not careful
473.762	about how you choose,
476.811	you wind up with this.
478	(Laughter)
479.771	This is an un-retouched --
479.771	this is not a joke --
482.627	un-retouched photo of Microsoft Word,
484.913	the copy that you have,
484.913	with all the toolbars open.
487.771	You've obviously never
487.771	opened all the toolbars,
491.117	but all you have to type in
491.117	is this little, teeny window down here.
495.883	(Laughter)
498.466	And we've arrived at the age
498.466	of interface matrices,
501.935	where there are so many
501.935	features and options,
504.101	you have to do two dimensions, you know:
506.045	a vertical and a horizontal.
507.412	You guys all complain
508.593	about how Microsoft Word
508.593	is always bulleting your lists
511.355	and underlining your links automatically.
513.473	The off switch is in there somewhere.
516.632	I'm telling you -- it's there.
518.235	Part of the art of designing
518.235	a simple, good interface,
521.503	is knowing when to use
521.503	which one of these features.
525.011	So, here is the log-off
525.011	dialogue box for Windows 2000.
528.56	There are only four choices,
531.084	so why are they in a pop-up menu?
534.164	It's not like the rest of the screen
534.164	is so full of other components
537.504	that you need to collapse the choices.
540	They could have put them all out in view.
542	Here's Apple's take
542	on the exact same dialogue box.
545	(Applause)
546.427	Thank you -- yes, I designed
546.427	the dialogue box. No, no.
550	Already, we can see
550	that Apple and Microsoft
552.639	have a severely divergent
552.639	approach to software design.
556.799	Microsoft's approach
556.799	to simplicity tends to be:
560.156	let's break it down;
560.156	let's just make it more steps.
563	"There are these ""wizards"" everywhere."
565	And you know, there's a new version
565	of Windows coming out this fall.
568.263	If they continue at this pace,
568.263	there's absolutely no telling
571.342	where they might wind up.
573.512	[Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard]
575.874	(Laughter)
577.066	(Applause)
580.38	"""Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard."""
582.189	Ok, I'll bite.
583.428	"Let's click ""Next"" to continue."
586	(Laughter)
588.327	(Applause)
590.198	From the drop-down menu, choose
590.198	the first letter you want to type. Ok.
593.572	(Laughter)
595.929	So there is a limit
595.929	that we don't want to cross.
598.492	So what is the answer?
599.667	How do you pack in all these features
599.667	in a simple, intelligent way?
603.767	I believe in consistency, when possible,
606.496	real-world equivalents,
607.822	trash can folder, when possible,
607.822	label things, mostly.
611.069	But I beg of the designers here
613.269	to break all those rules
613.269	if they violate the biggest rule of all,
616.864	which is intelligence.
618.077	Now what do I mean by that?
619.404	I'm going to give you some examples
621.119	where intelligence makes something
621.119	not consistent, but it's better.
624.475	If you are buying something on the web,
626.886	you're supposed to put in your address,
628.791	and you're supposed to choose
628.791	what country you're from, ok?
631.649	There are 200 countries in the world.
633.451	We like to think of the Internet
633.451	as a global village.
635.983	I'm sorry; it's not one yet.
637.378	It's mainly like, the United States,
637.378	Europe, and Japan.
640.006	"So why is ""United States"" in the ""U""s?"
642.381	(Laughter)
643.771	You have to scroll, like,
643.771	seven screensful to get to it.
646.724	Now, it would be inconsistent
646.724	"to put ""United States"" first,"
650	but it would be intelligent.
651.495	This one's been touched on before,
654.152	but why in God's name do you
654.152	shut down a Windows PC
658	"by clicking a button called ""Start?"""
660.423	(Laughter)
664.515	Here's another pet one of mine:
664.515	you have a printer.
668	Most of the time, you want to print
668	one copy of your document,
671.893	in page order, on that printer.
674.169	So why in God's name do you see
674.169	this every time you print?
678.794	It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit.
681.286	(Laughter)
682.873	And one of the buttons at the bottom,
682.873	"you'll notice, is not ""Print."""
686.665	(Laughter)
691	(Applause)
694.294	Now, I'm not saying that Apple
694.294	is the only company who has embraced
698.247	the cult of simplicity.
700.827	Palm is also, especially in the old days,
700.827	wonderful about this.
703.831	I actually got to speak to Palm
703.831	when they were flying high in the '90s,
707.213	and after the talk,
707.213	I met one of the employees.
709.441	"He says, ""Nice talk."" And I said,"
709.441	"""Thank you. What do you do here?"""
712.646	"He said, ""I'm a tap counter."""
712.646	"I'm like, ""You're a what?"""
715.311	"He goes, ""Well Jeff Hawkins,"
715.311	the CEO, says,
717.367	'If any task on the Palm Pilot
717.367	takes more than three taps of the stylus,
721.6	it's too long,
721.6	and it has to be redesigned.'
724.622	"So I'm the tap counter."""
726.414	So, I'm going to show you an example
728.2	of a company that does not
728.2	have a tap counter.
730.846	(Laughter)
732.133	This is Microsoft Word.
733.728	Ok, when you want to create
733.728	a new blank document in Word --
737.886	it could happen.
739.062	(Laughter)
744.434	"You go up to the ""File"" menu"
744.434	"and you choose ""New."""
747.917	"Now, what happens when you choose ""New?"""
750.14	Do you get a new blank document?
752.193	You do not.
753.408	On the opposite side of the monitor,
753.408	a task bar appears,
758.123	and somewhere in those links --
758.123	by the way, not at the top --
761.909	somewhere in those links is a button
761.909	that makes you a new document.
766.377	Ok, so that is a company
766.377	not counting taps.
769.394	You know, I don't want to just stand
769.394	here and make fun of Microsoft ...
773.222	Yes, I do.
774.548	(Laughter)
776	(Applause)
779.619	The Bill Gates song!
781.017	(Piano music)
782.469	I've been a geek forever
785.928	and I wrote the very first DOS.
790.168	I put my software and IBM together;
793.727	I got profit and they got the loss.
797	(Laughter)
799.702	I write the code
799.702	that makes the whole world run.
804.344	I'm getting royalties from everyone.
808.781	Sometimes it's garbage,
808.781	but the press is snowed.
813.431	You buy the box; I'll sell the code.
819.113	Every software company
819.113	is doing Microsoft's R&amp;D.
824	You can't keep a good idea
824	down these days.
828.156	Even Windows is a hack.
830.359	We're kind of based loosely on the Mac.
832.709	So it's big, so it's slow.
832.709	You've got nowhere to go.
835.441	I'm not doing this for praise.
838.642	I write the code
838.642	that fits the world today.
843.483	Big mediocrity in every way.
847.704	We've entered planet domination mode.
852	You'll have no choice; you'll buy my code.
857.902	I am Bill Gates and I write the code.
865.173	(Applause)
873	But actually, I believe
873	there are really two Microsofts.
875.726	There's the old one, responsible
875.726	for Windows and Office.
878.829	They're dying to throw the whole thing
878.829	out and start fresh, but they can't.
882.867	They're locked in, because so many add-ons
882.867	and other company stuff
886.591	locks into the old 1982 chassis.
889.236	But there's also a new Microsoft,
890.85	that's really doing good,
890.85	simple interface designs.
894.365	I liked the Media Center PC.
895.945	I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch.
897.725	The Wireless Watch
897.725	flopped miserably in the market,
900.702	but it wasn't because it wasn't
900.702	simply and beautifully designed.
903.774	But let's put it this way:
905.044	would you pay $10 a month to have a watch
907.559	that has to be recharged
907.559	every night like your cell phone,
910.841	and stops working
910.841	when you leave your area code?
913.404	(Laughter)
916.026	So, the signs might indicate
918.551	that the complexity crunch
918.551	is only going to get worse.
921.412	So is there any hope?
923.089	The screens are getting smaller,
923.089	people are illuminating,
925.812	putting manuals in the boxes,
927.233	things are coming out at a faster pace.
930	It's funny -- when Steve Jobs
930	came back to Apple in 1997,
933.417	after 12 years away,
933.417	it was the MacWorld Expo --
936.266	he came to the stage
936.266	in that black turtleneck and jeans,
939.432	and he sort of did this.
940.608	The crowd went wild,
940.608	but I had just seen --
943	I'm like, where have I seen this before?
944.95	"I had just seen the movie ""Evita"" --"
946.783	(Laughter)
949.892	with Madonna,
951.074	and I'm like, you know what?
952.846	I've got to do one about Steve Jobs.
955.967	(Music)
956.999	It won't be easy.
956.999	You'll think I'm strange.
960.039	(Laughter)
961.207	When I try to explain why I'm back,
963.54	after telling the press
963.54	Apple's future is black.
966.655	You won't believe me.
969.274	All that you see is a kid in his teens
969.274	who started out in a garage
974	with only a buddy named Woz.
977	(Laughter)
978.576	You try rhyming with garage!
980.333	(Laughter)
982.799	Don't cry for me, Cupertino.
985.698	(Laughter)
987.044	The truth is, I never left you.
990	I know the ropes now,
990	know what the tricks are.
993.559	I made a fortune over at Pixar.
997	(Laughter)
998.063	Don't cry for me, Cupertino.
1001.182	I've still got the drive and vision.
1004.519	I still wear sandals in any weather.
1007.995	It's just that these days,
1010	they're Gucci leather.
1012	(Laughter)
1014	(Applause)
1021.258	Thank you.
1022.815	So Steve Jobs had always believed
1022.815	in simplicity and elegance and beauty.
1027.547	And the truth is,
1029.468	for years I was a little depressed,
1031.62	because Americans
1031.62	obviously did not value it,
1033.917	because the Mac had
1033.917	three percent market share,
1036.218	Windows had 95 percent market share --
1038.099	people did not think it was worth
1038.099	putting a price on it.
1041	So I was a little depressed.
1042.815	And then I heard Al Gore's talk,
1044.396	and I realized I didn't know
1044.396	the meaning of depressed.
1046.959	(Laughter)
1048	But it turns out I was wrong, right?
1049.761	Because the iPod came out,
1051.518	and it violated every bit
1051.518	of common wisdom.
1054.16	Other products cost less;
1054.16	other products had more features,
1057.16	they had voice recorders
1057.16	and FM transmitters.
1059.921	The other products were backed
1059.921	by Microsoft, with an open standard,
1063.167	not Apple's propriety standard.
1064.905	But the iPod won --
1064.905	this is the one they wanted.
1067.501	The lesson was: simplicity sells.
1069.788	And there are signs that the industry
1069.788	is getting the message.
1072.686	This is a little company that's done
1072.686	very well with simplicity and elegance.
1076.301	The Sonos thing -- it's catching on.
1078.064	I've got just a couple examples.
1079.786	Physically, a really cool,
1079.786	elegant thinking coming along lately.
1083.486	When you have a digital camera,
1085.463	how do you get the pictures
1085.463	back to your computer?
1088.73	Well, you either haul around a USB cable,
1091.096	or you buy a card reader
1091.096	and haul that around.
1093.276	Either one, you're going to lose.
1094.887	What I do is, I take out the memory card,
1097.37	and I fold it in half,
1097.37	revealing USB contacts.
1102.739	I just stick it in the computer,
1102.739	offload the pictures,
1105.421	put it right back in the camera.
1106.984	I never have to lose anything.
1108.808	Here's another example.
1110.369	Chris, you're the source of all power.
1110.369	Will you be my power plug?
1113.463	Chris Anderson: Oh yeah.
1113.463	DP: Hold that and don't let go.
1116.227	You might've seen this,
1116.227	this is Apple's new laptop.
1118.672	This the power cord.
1118.672	It hooks on like this.
1120.72	And I'm sure every one of you has done
1120.72	this at some point in your lives,
1124.141	or one of your children.
1125.34	You walk along -- and I'm
1125.34	about to pull this onto the floor.
1128.189	I don't care. It's a loaner.
1129.549	Here we go. Whoa!
1130.756	It's magnetic -- it doesn't pull
1130.756	the laptop onto the floor.
1133.849	(Applause)
1138	In my very last example --
1139.993	I do a lot of my work
1139.993	using speech recognition software.
1143.993	And I'll just --
1143.993	you have to be kind of quiet
1146.247	because the software is nervous.
1148.524	Speech recognition
1148.524	software is really great
1150.628	for doing emails very quickly; period.
1153.182	Like, I get hundreds of them
1153.182	a day; period.
1155.845	And it's not just what I dictate
1155.845	that it writes down; period.
1159.16	I also use this feature
1159.16	called voice macros; period.
1163.92	"Correct ""dissuade."""
1168.999	"Not ""just."""
1172.248	Ok, this is not an ideal situation,
1173.954	because it's getting the echo
1173.954	from the hall and stuff.
1176.517	The point is, I can respond to people
1176.517	very quickly by saying a short word,
1180.777	and having it write out
1180.777	a much longer thing.
1182.873	So if somebody
1182.873	sends me a fan letter, I'll say,
1185.263	"""Thanks for that."""
1186.444	[Thank you so much
1186.444	for taking the time to write ...]
1188.975	(Laughter)
1190	(Applause)
1193	And conversely, if somebody
1193	sends me hate mail --
1197.462	which happens daily --
1199.788	"I say, ""Piss off."""
1204.508	(Laughter)
1205.849	[I admire your frankness ...]
1208.345	(Laughter)
1210	(Applause)
1215.377	So that's my dirty little secret.
1215.377	Don't tell anyone.
1218	(Laughter)
1219.139	So the point is --
1219.139	this is a really interesting story.
1222	This is version eight of this software,
1223.902	and do you know what they put
1223.902	in version eight?
1226.124	No new features. It's never
1226.124	happened before in software!
1229.21	The company put no new features.
1230.965	"They just said, ""We'll make"
1230.965	"this software work right."" Right?"
1234.604	Because for years, people had bought
1234.604	this software, tried it out --
1239.669	which means one in 20 words is wrong --
1241.589	and they'd put it in their drawer.
1243.24	And the company got sick of that,
1244.844	"so they said, ""This version,"
1244.844	we're not going to do anything,
1247.704	"but make sure it's darned accurate."""
1249.461	And so that's what they did.
1250.834	This cult of doing things right
1250.834	is starting to spread.
1253.446	So, my final advice for those of you
1253.446	who are consumers of this technology:
1256.966	remember, if it doesn't work,
1256.966	it's not necessarily you, ok?
1261	It could be the design
1261	of the thing you're using.
1263.358	Be aware in life
1263.358	of good design and bad design.
1266.17	And if you're among the people
1266.17	who create this stuff:
1269.061	Easy is hard.
1270.404	Pre-sweat the details for your audience.
1272.762	Count the taps.
1274	Remember, the hard part
1274	is not deciding what features to add,
1276.967	it's deciding what to leave out.
1278.76	And best of all, your motivation is:
1278.76	simplicity sells.
1282.611	CA: Bravo. DP: Thank you very much.
1284.302	CA: Hear, hear!
1285.477	(Applause)
