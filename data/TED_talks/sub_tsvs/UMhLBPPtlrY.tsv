12.146	I'll never forget that day
13.824	back in the spring of 2006.
17.723	I was a surgical resident
19.302	at The Johns Hopkins Hospital,
21.733	taking emergency call.
23.51	I got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning
26.873	to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer
28.9	on her foot.
30.694	I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh
34.395	as I pulled the curtain back to see her.
38.022	And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick
40.367	and she needed to be in the hospital.
41.719	That wasn't being asked.
43.319	The question that was being asked of me was a different one,
45.461	which was, did she also need an amputation?
49.39	Now, looking back on that night,
52.357	I'd love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman
57.522	on that night with the same empathy and compassion
60.658	I'd shown the 27-year-old newlywed
64.893	who came to the E.R. three nights earlier
66.838	with lower back pain
68.452	that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer.
72.701	In her case, I knew there was nothing I could do
74.864	that was actually going to save her life.
76.632	The cancer was too advanced.
78.681	But I was committed to making sure that
81.361	I could do anything possible to make her stay
83.784	more comfortable. I brought her a warm blanket
86.207	and a cup of a coffee.
88.927	I brought some for her parents.
91.112	But more importantly, see, I passed no judgment on her,
94.258	because obviously she had done nothing
96.155	to bring this on herself.
98.329	So why was it that, just a few nights later,
101.142	as I stood in that same E.R. and determined
104.3	that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation,
107.711	why did I hold her in such bitter contempt?
111.615	You see, unlike the woman the night before,
114.08	this woman had type 2 diabetes.
116.479	She was fat.
118.031	And we all know that's from eating too much
119.944	and not exercising enough, right?
122.299	I mean, how hard can it be?
124.983	As I looked down at her in the bed, I thought to myself,
127.344	if you just tried caring even a little bit,
130.232	you wouldn't be in this situation at this moment
133.222	with some doctor you've never met
134.999	about to amputate your foot.
138.814	Why did I feel justified in judging her?
142.456	I'd like to say I don't know.
145.025	But I actually do.
147.061	You see, in the hubris of my youth,
149.392	I thought I had her all figured out.
152.496	She ate too much. She got unlucky.
154.326	She got diabetes. Case closed.
157.695	Ironically, at that time in my life,
159.098	I was also doing cancer research,
161.496	immune-based therapies for melanoma, to be specific,
163.839	and in that world I was actually taught to question everything,
167.812	to challenge all assumptions
169.848	and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards.
173.658	Yet when it came to a disease like diabetes
177.034	that kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma,
180.583	I never once questioned the conventional wisdom.
184.011	I actually just assumed the pathologic sequence of events
187.057	was settled science.
189.642	Three years later, I found out how wrong I was.
193.042	But this time, I was the patient.
195.642	Despite exercising three or four hours every single day,
199.473	and following the food pyramid to the letter,
202.038	I'd gained a lot of weight and developed something
204.195	called metabolic syndrome.
206.48	Some of you may have heard of this.
208.464	I had become insulin-resistant.
211.909	You can think of insulin as this master hormone
214.358	that controls what our body does with the foods we eat,
218.421	whether we burn it or store it.
220.535	This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo.
223.349	Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life.
226.525	And insulin resistance, as its name suggests,
229.181	is when your cells get increasingly resistant
231.861	to the effect of insulin trying to do its job.
235.374	Once you're insulin-resistant,
237.55	you're on your way to getting diabetes,
238.925	which is what happens when your pancreas
240.989	can't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin.
244.312	Now your blood sugar levels start to rise,
246.94	and an entire cascade of pathologic events
249.572	sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease,
253.273	cancer, even Alzheimer's disease,
256.882	and amputations, just like that woman a few years earlier.
261.764	With that scare, I got busy changing my diet radically,
264.725	adding and subtracting things most of you would find
266.902	almost assuredly shocking.
269.982	I did this and lost 40 pounds, weirdly while exercising less.
273.861	I, as you can see, I guess I'm not overweight anymore.
276.902	More importantly, I don't have insulin resistance.
279.069	But most important, I was left
281.113	with these three burning questions that wouldn't go away:
284.962	How did this happen to me if I was supposedly
287.411	doing everything right?
290.108	If the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me,
293.143	was it possible it was failing someone else?
296.93	And underlying these questions,
298.83	I became almost maniacally obsessed
302.076	in trying to understand the real relationship
304.803	between obesity and insulin resistance.
308.433	Now, most researchers believe obesity
311.249	is the cause of insulin resistance.
314.641	Logically, then, if you want to treat insulin resistance,
316.756	you get people to lose weight, right?
318.648	You treat the obesity.
321.412	But what if we have it backwards?
324.118	What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all?
327.489	In fact, what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem,
331.409	the tip of a proverbial iceberg?
334.231	I know it sounds crazy because we're obviously in the midst
336.874	of an obesity epidemic, but hear me out.
340.093	What if obesity is a coping mechanism
343.307	for a far more sinister problem going on
346.909	underneath the cell?
348.391	I'm not suggesting that obesity is benign,
350.757	but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser
353.06	of two metabolic evils.
355.771	You can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity
358.79	of our cells to partition fuel,
360.777	as I alluded to a moment ago,
363.068	taking those calories that we take in
364.99	and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately.
368.429	When we become insulin-resistant,
370.071	the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state.
373.438	So now, when insulin says to a cell,
375.566	I want you to burn more energy
377.611	than the cell considers safe, the cell, in effect, says,
380.046	"""No thanks, I'd actually rather store this energy."""
384.478	And because fat cells are actually missing most of
386.38	the complex cellular machinery found in other cells,
389.182	it's probably the safest place to store it.
391.953	So for many of us, about 75 million Americans,
396.922	the appropriate response to insulin resistance
400.537	may actually be to store it as fat, not the reverse,
405.466	getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat.
410.81	This is a really subtle distinction,
412.985	but the implication could be profound.
416.352	Consider the following analogy:
418.85	Think of the bruise you get on your shin
421.819	when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table.
425.411	Sure, the bruise hurts like hell, and you almost certainly
428.298	don't like the discolored look, but we all know
431.279	the bruise per Se is not the problem.
434.732	In fact, it's the opposite. It's a healthy response to the trauma,
438.474	all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury
441.235	to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread
444.219	of infection to elsewhere in the body.
446.917	Now, imagine we thought bruises were the problem,
450.639	and we evolved a giant medical establishment
453.507	and a culture around treating bruises:
456.647	masking creams, painkillers, you name it,
459.93	all the while ignoring the fact that people
462.156	are still banging their shins into coffee tables.
465.776	How much better would we be if we treated the cause --
468.979	telling people to pay attention
470.544	when they walk through the living room --
472.147	rather than the effect?
475.42	Getting the cause and the effect right
477.297	makes all the difference in the world.
479.776	Getting it wrong, and the pharmaceutical industry
482.855	can still do very well for its shareholders
485.535	but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins.
489.451	Cause and effect.
492.295	So what I'm suggesting is
494.132	maybe we have the cause and effect wrong
496.889	on obesity and insulin resistance.
499.523	Maybe we should be asking ourselves,
501.3	is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain
505.185	and the diseases associated with obesity,
507.251	at least in most people?
508.781	What if being obese is just a metabolic response
511.781	to something much more threatening,
514.002	an underlying epidemic,
516.213	the one we ought to be worried about?
518.77	Let's look at some suggestive facts.
520.242	We know that 30 million obese Americans
522.728	in the United States don't have insulin resistance.
525.701	And by the way, they don't appear to be at any
527.638	greater risk of disease than lean people.
530.718	Conversely, we know that six million lean people
533.602	in the United States are insulin-resistant,
537.039	and by the way, they appear to be at even greater risk
540.106	for those metabolic diseases I mentioned a moment ago
542.261	than their obese counterparts.
544.083	Now I don't know why, but it might be because,
546.32	in their case, their cells haven't actually figured out
549.01	the right thing to do with that excess energy.
552.295	So if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance,
555.614	and you can be lean and have it,
557.485	this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy
561.918	for what's going on.
564.942	So what if we're fighting the wrong war,
567.357	fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance?
571.157	Even worse, what if blaming the obese
574.4	means we're blaming the victims?
577.125	What if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity
580.844	are just wrong?
582.702	Personally, I can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore,
586.825	let alone the luxury of certainty.
589.408	I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this,
592.254	but I'm wide open to others.
594.166	Now, my hypothesis, because everybody always asks me,
596.885	is this.
598.502	If you ask yourself, what's a cell trying to protect itself from
601.631	when it becomes insulin resistant,
603.358	the answer probably isn't too much food.
606.033	It's more likely too much glucose: blood sugar.
609.683	Now, we know that refined grains and starches
611.977	elevate your blood sugar in the short run,
614.033	and there's even reason to believe that sugar
615.941	may lead to insulin resistance directly.
618.742	So if you put these physiological processes to work,
622.837	I'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake
626.31	of refined grains, sugars and starches that's driving
629.173	this epidemic of obesity and diabetes,
633.824	but through insulin resistance,
635.662	you see, and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising.
639.574	When I lost my 40 pounds a few years ago,
642.159	I did it simply by restricting those things,
644.759	which admittedly suggests I have a bias
648.215	based on my personal experience.
650.576	But that doesn't mean my bias is wrong,
653.231	and most important, all of this can be tested scientifically.
657.184	But step one is accepting the possibility
660.291	that our current beliefs about obesity,
662.663	diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong
665.669	and therefore must be tested.
668.544	I'm betting my career on this.
670.935	Today, I devote all of my time to working on this problem,
675.06	and I'll go wherever the science takes me.
678.233	I've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore
681.764	is pretend I have the answers when I don't.
684.808	I've been humbled enough by all I don't know.
688.916	For the past year, I've been fortunate enough
691.073	to work on this problem with the most amazing team
694.486	of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country,
697.89	and the best part is,
699.195	just like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals,
703.094	we've done the same thing.
704.59	We've recruited a team of scientific rivals,
707.853	the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses
711.298	for what's at the heart of this epidemic.
712.912	Some think it's too many calories consumed.
715.293	Others think it's too much dietary fat.
717.672	Others think it's too many refined grains and starches.
721.142	But this team of multi-disciplinary,
723.75	highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers
726.734	do agree on two things.
729.022	First, this problem is just simply too important
732.671	to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer.
735.414	And two, if we're willing to be wrong,
738.198	if we're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom
740.735	with the best experiments science can offer,
743.798	we can solve this problem.
746.103	I know it's tempting to want an answer right now,
749.158	some form of action or policy, some dietary prescription --
753.655	eat this, not that —
755.384	but if we want to get it right,
757.064	we're going to have to do much more rigorous science
759.298	before we can write that prescription.
762.151	Briefly, to address this, our research program
764.75	is focused around three meta-themes, or questions.
767.993	First, how do the various foods we consume
770.888	impact our metabolism, hormones and enzymes,
773.689	and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms?
776.507	Second, based on these insights,
778.757	can people make the necessary changes in their diets
781.716	in a way that's safe and practical to implement?
785.447	And finally, once we identify what safe
788.456	and practical changes people can make to their diet,
791.484	how can we move their behavior in that direction
795.159	so that it becomes more the default
797.412	rather than the exception?
799.268	Just because you know what to do doesn't mean
801.688	you're always going to do it.
803.197	Sometimes we have to put cues around people
805.325	to make it easier, and believe it or not,
807.628	that can be studied scientifically.
811.269	I don't know how this journey is going to end,
813.853	but this much seems clear to me, at least:
818.066	We can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients
823.062	like I did.
825.974	Most of them actually want to do the right thing,
828.253	but they have to know what that is,
831.622	and it's got to work.
834.668	I dream of a day when our patients can
839.364	shed their excess pounds
841.099	and cure themselves of insulin resistance,
843.912	because as medical professionals,
846.642	we've shed our excess mental baggage
848.612	and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently
851.938	to go back to our original ideals:
855.028	open minds, the courage to throw out yesterday's ideas
859.445	when they don't appear to be working,
862.773	and the understanding that scientific truth isn't final,
865.892	but constantly evolving.
868.64	Staying true to that path will be better for our patients
871.932	and better for science.
875.18	If obesity is nothing more than a proxy
878.174	for metabolic illness,
880.1	what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy?
885.397	Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R.
889.941	seven years ago.
892.254	I wish I could speak with that woman again.
895.878	I'd like to tell her how sorry I am.
899.133	I'd say, as a doctor, I delivered
902.02	the best clinical care I could,
905.68	but as a human being,
909.577	I let you down.
911.985	You didn't need my judgment and my contempt.
916.23	You needed my empathy and compassion,
920.728	and above all else, you needed a doctor
922.723	who was willing to consider
925.352	maybe you didn't let the system down.
928.416	Maybe the system, of which I was a part,
931.634	was letting you down.
934.073	If you're watching this now,
936.874	I hope you can forgive me.
941.112	(Applause)
