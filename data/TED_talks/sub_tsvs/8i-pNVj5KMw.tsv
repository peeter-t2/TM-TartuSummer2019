12.884	"""Where are you from?"""
12.884	said the pale, tattooed man.
19.583	"""Where are you from?"""
24.453	It's September 21, 2001,
	on America since World War II.
34.715	Everyone wonders about the next plane.
38.94	People are looking for scapegoats.
42.762	The president, 
42.762	the night before, pledges to
46.49	"""bring our enemies to justice "
46.49	"or bring justice to our enemies."""
52.934	And in the Dallas mini-mart,
58.493	a Dallas mini-part surrounded
58.493	by tire shops and strip joints
64.266	a Bangladeshi immigrant 
64.266	works the register.
68.273	Back home, Raisuddin Bhuiyan
68.273	was a big man, an Air Force officer.
75.315	But he dreamed of a 
75.315	fresh start in America.
78.919	If he had to work briefly in a mini-mart
78.919	to save up for I.T. classes
84.217	and his wedding in two months, so be it.
87.605	Then, on September 21, 
87.605	that tattooed man enters the mart.
92.785	He holds a shotgun.
96.496	Raisuddin knows the drill:
98.159	puts cash on the counter.
102.058	This time, the man doesn't 
102.058	touch the money.
106.519	"""Where are you from?"" he asks."
110.99	"""Excuse me?"" Raisuddin answers."
116.192	His accent betrays him.
120.317	The tattooed man, a self-styled
120.317	true American vigilante,
125.334	shoots Raisuddin in revenge for 9/11.
130.083	Raisuddin feels millions of bees
130.083	stinging his face.
135.982	In fact, dozens of scalding, 
135.982	birdshot pellets puncture his head.
142.279	Behind the counter, he lays in blood.
145.859	He cups a hand over his forehead
145.859	to keep in the brains
150.35	on which he'd gambled everything.
154.298	He recites verses from the Koran,
154.298	begging his God to live.
160.857	He senses he is dying.
165.172	He didn't die.
167.69	His right eye left him.
171.006	His fianc√©e left him.
174.591	His landlord, the mini-mart owner,
174.591	kicked him out.
178.691	Soon he was homeless and 
184.004	including a fee for dialing 
184.004	for an ambulance.
189.996	But Raisuddin lived.
192.458	And years later, he would ask
192.458	what he could do to repay his God
198.453	and become worthy of this second chance.
201.792	He would come to believe, in fact,
203.883	that this chance called for him
203.883	to give a second chance
209.611	to a man we might think
209.611	deserved no chance at all.
215.544	Twelve years ago, I was a fresh graduate
215.544	seeking my way in the world.
221.632	Born in Ohio to Indian immigrants,
224.132	I settled on the ultimate rebellion 
224.132	against my parents,
227.399	moving to the country they had worked
227.399	so damn hard to get out of.
232.429	What I thought might be a six-month stint
232.429	in Mumbai stretched to six years.
238.02	I became a writer and found myself
238.02	amid a magical story:
242.665	the awakening of hope across much
242.665	of the so-called Third World.
247.182	Six years ago, I returned to America
247.182	and realized something:
252.238	The American Dream was thriving,
255.302	but only in India.
258.825	In America, not so much.
262.27	In fact, I observed that 
262.27	America was fracturing
266.093	into two distinct societies:
268.327	a republic of dreams
268.327	and a republic of fears.
272.966	And then, I stumbled onto this 
272.966	incredible tale of two lives
276.317	and of these two Americas that brutally
276.317	collided in that Dallas mini-mart.
283.64	I knew at once I wanted to learn more,
286.041	and eventually that I would write
286.041	a book about them,
288.812	for their story was the story 
288.812	of America's fracturing
292.694	and of how it might be put back together.
298.28	After he was shot, Raisuddin's life
298.28	grew no easier.
302.26	The day after admitting him,
302.26	the hospital discharged him.
306.96	His right eye couldn't see.
308.938	He couldn't speak.
310.546	Metal peppered his face.
313.665	But he had no insurance, 
313.665	so they bounced him.
317.846	His family in Bangladesh 
317.846	"begged him, ""Come home."""
323.07	But he told them he had 
323.07	a dream to see about.
327.148	He found telemarketing work,
329.699	then he became an Olive Garden waiter,
332.974	because where better to get over his fear
332.974	of white people than the Olive Garden?
337.094	(Laughter)
340.434	Now, as a devout Muslim,
340.434	he refused alcohol,
344.991	didn't touch the stuff.
347.188	Then he learned that not selling it
347.188	would slash his pay.
352.215	So he reasoned, like a budding 
352.215	American pragmatist,
356.006	"""Well, God wouldn't want me"
356.006	"to starve, would he?"""
360.138	And before long, in some months, 
360.138	Raisuddin was that Olive Garden's
363.406	highest grossing alcohol pusher.
367.477	He found a man who taught him
367.477	database administration.
371.364	He got part-time I.T. gigs.
373.486	Eventually, he landed a six-figure job
373.486	at a blue chip tech company in Dallas.
380.048	But as America began
380.048	to work for Raisuddin,
384.816	he avoided the classic
384.816	error of the fortunate:
388.853	assuming you're the rule, 
388.853	not the exception.
392.777	In fact, he observed that many with
392.777	the fortune of being born American
398.576	were nonetheless trapped in lives that 
398.576	made second chances like his impossible.
405.298	He saw it at the Olive Garden itself,
408.729	where so many of his colleagues had
408.729	childhood horror stories
412.239	of family dysfunction, chaos, 
412.239	addiction, crime.
416.956	He'd heard a similar tale about
416.956	the man who shot him
421.407	back when he attended his trial.
424.059	The closer Raisuddin got to the America
424.059	he had coveted from afar,
429.789	the more he realized there was
429.789	another, equally real, America
433.973	that was stingier with second chances.
439.595	The man who shot Raisuddin grew up
439.595	in that stingier America.
445.89	From a distance, Mark Stroman
445.89	was always the spark of parties,
450.98	always making girls feel pretty.
454.543	Always working, no matter what 
454.543	drugs or fights he'd had the night before.
459.139	But he'd always wrestled with demons.
463.244	He entered the world through
463.244	the three gateways
465.749	that doom so many young American men:
468.471	bad parents, bad schools, bad prisons.
473.34	His mother told him, regretfully, as a boy
476.871	that she'd been just 50 dollars 
476.871	short of aborting him.
482.214	Sometimes, that little boy 
482.214	would be at school,
488.078	he'd suddenly pull a knife 
488.078	on his fellow classmates.
492.579	Sometimes that same little boy
492.579	would be at his grandparents',
496.187	tenderly feeding horses.
498.934	He was getting arrested before he shaved,
501.379	first juvenile, then prison.
503.805	He became a casual white supremacist
506.944	and, like so many around him, 
506.944	a drug-addled and absent father.
512.656	And then, before long,
512.656	he found himself on death row,
517.564	for in his 2001 counter-jihad, 
517.564	he had shot not one mini-mart clerk,
523.688	but three.
525.596	Only Raisuddin survived.
528.944	Strangely, death row was 
528.944	the first institution
533.808	that left Stroman better.
537.341	His old influences quit him.
539.569	The people entering his life 
539.569	were virtuous and caring:
543.225	pastors, journalists, European pen-pals.
547.989	They listened to him, prayed with him,
547.989	helped him question himself.
554.282	And sent him on a journey 
554.282	of introspection and betterment.
559.428	He finally faced the hatred 
559.428	that had defined his life.
564.362	He read Viktor Frankl, 
564.362	the Holocaust survivor
567.253	and regretted his swastika tattoos.
570.633	He found God.
572.925	Then one day in 2011, 
577.152	Stroman received news.
579.591	One of the men he'd shot, the survivor,
579.591	was fighting to save his life.
587.384	You see, late in 2009,
587.384	eight years after that shooting,
593.173	Raisuddin had gone on his own journey,
593.173	a pilgrimage to Mecca.
599.196	Amid its crowds, 
599.196	he felt immense gratitude,
603.45	but also duty.
605.245	He recalled promising God, 
605.245	as he lay dying in 2001,
609.034	that if he lived, he would serve 
609.034	humanity all his days.
614.234	Then, he'd gotten busy 
614.234	relaying the bricks of a life.
619.529	Now it was time to pay his debts.
623.982	And he decided, upon reflection,
623.982	that his method of payment
627.872	would be an intervention 
627.872	in the cycle of vengeance
631.135	between the Muslim and Western worlds.
633.994	And how would he intervene?
636.689	By forgiving Stroman publicly
636.689	in the name of Islam
640.991	and its doctrine of mercy.
642.731	And then suing the state of Texas
642.731	and its governor Rick Perry
649.292	to prevent them from executing Stroman,
652.997	exactly like most people 
652.997	shot in the face do.
656.111	(Laughter)
658.475	Yet Raisuddin's mercy was inspired 
658.475	not only by faith.
665.701	A newly minted American citizen,
665.701	he had come to believe that Stroman
671.759	was the product of a hurting America that
671.759	couldn't just be lethally injected away.
678.739	That insight is what moved me 
678.739	"to write my book ""The True American."""
683.204	This immigrant begging America 
683.204	to be as merciful to a native son
687.851	as it had been to an adopted one.
692.768	In the mini-mart, all those years earlier,
695.621	not just two men, 
695.621	but two Americas collided.
700.047	An America that still dreams, 
700.047	still strives,
702.968	still imagines that tomorrow
702.968	can build on today,
707.047	and an America that has resigned to fate,
710.146	buckled under stress and chaos,
710.146	lowered expectations,
713.28	an ducked into the oldest of refuges:
716.418	the tribal fellowship of one's
716.418	own narrow kind.
720.218	And it was Raisuddin, despite
720.218	being a newcomer,
722.888	despite being attacked,
724.215	despite being homeless and traumatized,
727.088	who belonged to that republic of dreams
730.492	and Stroman who belonged to that 
730.492	other wounded country,
735.103	despite being born with the privilege
735.103	of a native white man.
740.418	I realized these men's stories formed
740.418	an urgent parable about America.
746.704	The country I am so proud to call my own
750.723	wasn't living through a 
750.723	generalized decline
754.589	as seen in Spain or Greece, 
754.589	where prospects were dimming for everyone.
761.683	America is simultaneously the most
761.683	and the least successful country
766.68	in the industrialized world.
769.027	Launching the world's best companies,
771.571	even as record numbers 
771.571	of children go hungry.
774.97	Seeing life-expectancy drop
774.97	for large groups,
779.125	even as it polishes 
779.125	the world's best hospitals.
782.831	America today is a sprightly young body,
787.134	hit by one of those strokes 
787.134	that sucks the life from one side,
792.952	while leaving the other
792.952	worryingly perfect.
797.43	On July 20, 2011, right after 
797.43	a sobbing Raisuddin
804.056	testified in defense of Stroman's life,
806.355	Stroman was killed by lethal injection
806.355	by the state he so loved.
812.679	Hours earlier, when Raisuddin still
812.679	thought he could still save Stroman,
817.232	the two men got to speak 
817.232	for the second time ever.
820.2	Here is an excerpt from their phone call.
823.592	"Raisuddin: ""Mark, you should know "
823.592	that I am praying for God,
829.45	the most compassionate and gracious.
832.493	I forgive you and I do not hate you.
834.961	"I never hated you."""
837.952	"Stroman: ""You are a remarkable person."
842.396	Thank you from my heart.
844.513	"I love you, bro."""
847.4	Even more amazingly, after the execution,
851.318	Raisuddin reached out to Stroman's 
851.318	eldest daughter, Amber,
855.53	an ex-convinct and an addict.
858.273	and offered his help.
860.06	"""You may have lost a father,"""
860.06	he told her,
863.058	"""but you've gained an uncle."""
866.6	He wanted her, too, to have 
866.6	a second chance.
872.483	If human history were a parade,
877.618	America's float would be 
877.618	a neon shrine to second chances.
884.325	But America, generous with second chances
884.325	to the children of other lands,
890.025	today grows miserly with first chances
890.025	to the children of its own.
896.241	America still dazzles at allowing
896.241	anybody to become an American.
901.168	But it is losing its luster at allowing
901.168	every American to become a somebody.
907.811	Over the last decade, seven million
907.811	foreigners gained American citizenship.
912.583	Remarkable.
914.607	In the meanwhile, how many Americans
914.607	gained a place in the middle class?
919.912	Actually, the net influx was negative.
923.682	Go back further, 
923.682	and it's even more striking:
925.981	Since the 60s, the middle class
925.981	has shrunk by 20 percent,
931.212	mainly because of the people
931.212	tumbling out of it.
934.564	And my reporting around the country
934.564	tells me the problem is grimmer
938.226	than simple inequality.
940.639	What I observe is a pair of secessions
940.639	from the unifying center of American life.
946.574	An affluent secession of up, up and away,
950.102	into elite enclaves of the educated
950.102	and into a global matrix
953.534	of work, money and connections,
956.317	and an impoverished secession 
956.317	of down and out
960.415	into disconnected, dead-end lives
963.159	that the fortunate scarcely see.
967.183	And don't console yourself 
967.183	that you are the 99 percent.
973.918	If you live near a Whole Foods,
978.504	if no one in your family serves 
978.504	in the military,
982.167	if you're paid by the year,
982.167	not the hour,
987.386	if most people you know finished college,
990.783	if no one you know uses meth,
993.105	if you married once and remain married,
995.285	if you're not one of 65 million Americans
995.285	with a criminal record --
999.627	if any or all of these things 
999.627	describe you,
1003.409	then accept the possibility that actually,
1006.276	you may not know what's going on
1008.699	and you may be part of the problem.
1014.588	Other generations had to build 
1014.588	a fresh society after slavery,
1020.576	pull through a depression,
1020.576	defeat fascism,
1024.84	freedom-ride in Mississippi.
1027.569	The moral challenge of 
1027.569	my generation, I believe,
1030.096	is to reacquaint these two Americas,
1033.213	to choose union over secession once again.
1038.392	This ins't a problem we can tax
1038.392	or tax-cut away.
1042.337	It won't be solved by tweeting harder,
1042.337	building slicker apps,
1046.527	or starting one more 
1046.527	artisanal coffee roasting service.
1050.965	It is a moral challenge that begs 
1050.965	each of us in the flourishing America
1057.232	to take on the wilting America as our own,
1061.327	as Raisuddin tried to do.
1064.342	Like him, we can make pilgrimages.
1066.923	And there, in Baltimore and Oregon 
1066.923	and Appalachia,
1070.446	find new purpose, as he did.
1072.938	We can immerse ourselves 
1072.938	in that other country,
1076.197	bear witness to its hopes and sorrows,
1079.974	and, like Raisuddin, ask what we can do.
1086.829	What can you do?
1089.955	What can you do?
1091.706	What can we do?
1093.679	How might we build 
1093.679	a more merciful country?
1098.726	We, the greatest inventors in the world,
1102.933	can invent solutions to the problems 
1102.933	of that America, not only our own.
1107.948	We, the writers and the journalists, 
1107.948	can cover that America's stories,
1111.35	instead of shutting down 
1111.35	bureaus in its midst.
1114.946	We can finance that America's ideas,
1118.19	instead of ideas from New York 
1118.19	and San Francisco.
1121.405	We can put our stethoscopes to its backs,
1124.25	teach there, go to court there,
1124.25	make there, live there, pray there.
1130.475	This, I believe, is the calling 
1130.475	of a generation.
1135.272	An America whose two halves learn again
1138.758	to stride, to plow, to forge,
1138.758	to dare together.
1146.374	A republic of chances, rewoven, renewed,
1152.099	begins with us.
1155.777	Thank you.
1157.616	(Applause)
