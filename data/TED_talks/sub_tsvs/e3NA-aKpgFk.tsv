25.6	I've always wanted to be a cyborg.
27.28	One of my favorite shows as a kid
27.28	"was ""The Six Million Dollar Man,"""
30.48	and this is a little bit closer
30.48	to the 240-dollar man or so, but --
33.68	(Laughter)
35	At any rate, I would normally
35	feel very self-conscious and geeky
38.44	wearing this around,
39.68	but a few days ago
39.68	I saw one world-renowned statistician
43.04	swallowing swords on stage here,
44.64	so I figure it's OK amongst this group.
48.28	But that's not what I want
48.28	to talk about today.
50.52	I want to talk about toys,
50.52	and the power that I see inherent in them.
54.44	When I was a kid,
54.44	I attended Montessori school
56.64	up to sixth grade in Atlanta, Georgia.
59.04	And at the time
59.04	I didn't think much about it,
61.2	but then later, I realized that that was
61.2	the high point of my education.
64.64	From that point on, everything else
64.64	was pretty much downhill.
67.92	And it wasn't until later,
67.92	as I started making games, that --
70.88	I really actually
70.88	think of them more as toys.
73.04	People call me a game designer,
74.6	but I really think
74.6	of these things more as toys.
76.88	I started getting very interested
76.88	in Maria Montessori and her methods,
80.26	and the way she went about things,
81.94	and the way she thought it
81.94	very valuable for kids
84.3	to discover things on their own
85.86	rather than being taught
85.86	these things overtly.
88.06	And she would design these toys,
88.06	where kids in playing with the toys
91.32	would come to understand
91.32	these deep principles
93.52	of life and nature through play.
95.12	And since they discovered this,
95.12	it stuck with them so much more,
98.16	and also they would experience
98.16	their own failures.
100.56	There was a failure-based aspect
100.56	to learning there. It was very important.
104.08	And so, the games that I do,
105.48	I think of really more
105.48	as modern Montessori toys.
107.84	And I really kind of want them
107.84	to be presented in a way
110.46	to where kids can kind of explore
110.46	and discover their own principles.
113.68	So a few years ago,
114.869	I started getting very interested
114.869	in the SETI program.
117.46	And that's the way I work.
118.781	I get interested in different subjects,
118.781	I dive in, research them,
121.882	and then try to figure out
121.882	how to craft a toy around that,
124.663	so that other people can experience
124.663	the same sense of discovery
127.664	that I did as I was learning that subject.
129.727	And it led me to astrobiology,
131.208	the study of possible life
131.208	in the universe.
133.289	And then Drake's equation,
134.61	looking at the probability
134.61	of life arising on planets,
137.211	how long it might last,
137.211	how many planets are out there.
139.852	And I started looking
139.852	at how interesting Drake's equation was,
142.813	because it spanned
142.813	all these different subjects --
145.214	physics, chemistry,
145.214	sociology, economics, astronomy.
149.16	And another thing that really
149.16	impressed me a long time ago
151.92	"was ""Powers of Ten,"""
151.92	Charles and Ray Eames' film.
154.919	And I started putting those two together
154.919	and wondering, could I build a toy
158.52	where kids would trip across
158.52	all these interesting principles of life,
161.88	as it exists and as it might
161.88	go in the future.
164.08	Things where you might trip across things
166.08	like the Copernican principle,
166.08	the Fermi paradox,
168.44	the anthropic principle,
168.44	the origin of life.
171	And so I'm going to show you a toy today
171	that I've been working on,
174.2	that I think of more
174.2	as kind of a philosophy toy.
177.16	Playing this toy will bring up
177.16	philosophical questions in you.
180.56	"The game is ""Spore."""
180.56	I've been working on it for several years.
183.64	It's getting pretty close to finished now.
185.68	It occurs at all these different scales,
185.68	from very small to very large.
189.081	I'm going to pop in
189.081	at the start of the game.
191.242	And you actually start this game
191.242	in a drop of water,
193.723	as a very, very small
193.723	single-cell creature,
195.764	and right off the bat you basically
195.764	just have to live, survive, reproduce.
199.821	So here we are,
199.821	at a very microscopic scale,
202.8	swimming around.
204.28	And I actually realize
204.28	that cells don't have eyes,
206.68	but it helps to make it cute.
209	The players are going to play
209	through every generation of this species,
212.88	and as you play the game,
214.16	the creature is actually
214.16	growing bit by bit.
216.28	And as we start growing,
217.88	the camera will
217.88	actually start zooming out,
219.96	and things that you see
219.96	in the background there
222.2	will start slowly
222.2	pulling into the foreground,
224.4	showing you a little bit of what
224.4	you'll be interacting with as you grow.
227.84	So as we eat, the camera
227.84	starts pulling out,
230	and then we start interacting
230	with larger and larger organisms.
233	We actually play
233	through many generations here,
235.24	at the cellular scale.
236.48	I'm going to skip ahead here.
237.92	At some point we get larger,
239.32	and we actually get
239.32	to a macroevolution scale.
243.102	Now, at this point
243.102	we're leaving the water,
246	and one thing that's kind of important
246	about this game is that, at every level,
249.76	the player is designing their creature,
252.04	and that's a fundamental aspect of this.
254	Now, in the evolution game here,
254	the creature scale,
257	basically you have to eat,
257	survive, and then reproduce.
259.6	You know, very Darwinian.
261.44	"One thing we noticed with ""The Sims,"""
261.44	a game I did earlier,
264.44	is that players love making stuff.
266.12	When they were able
266.12	to make stuff in the game,
268.32	they had a lot of empathy
268.32	in connection to it.
270.561	Even if it wasn't as pretty
272.261	as a professional artist
272.261	would make for games,
274.976	it really stuck with them
276.217	and they really cared
276.217	about what would happen to it.
278.698	At this point, we've left the water,
278.698	and now with this little creature --
282.152	we could bring up
282.152	the volume a little bit --
284.246	and now we might try to eat.
286.814	We might sneak up
286.814	on this little guy over here maybe,
291.08	and try and eat him.
293.16	OK, well, we fight.
294.4	(Creatures grunting)
297.76	OK, we got him.
300.28	Now we get a meal.
303.344	So really, at this part of the game,
305.12	what we're doing is we're
305.12	running around and surviving,
307.76	and also getting to the next generation,
309.72	because we're going to play
309.72	through every generation of this creature.
313.04	We can mate, so I'm going to see
314.64	if one of these creatures
314.64	wants to mate with me. Yeah.
321.636	(Creatures grunting)
323.68	We didn't want to replay
323.68	actual evolution with humans and all that,
327.52	because it's almost more interesting
329.28	to look at alternate
329.28	possibilities in evolution.
331.56	Evolution is usually presented
331.56	as this one path that we took through,
334.84	but really it represents
334.84	this huge set of possibilities.
337.52	Now, once we mate, we click on the egg.
339.44	And this is where the game
339.44	starts getting interesting,
342	because one of the things
342	we really focused on here
344.44	was giving the players
344.44	very high-leverage tools,
346.72	so that for very little effort,
346.72	the player can make something very cool.
350.32	And it involves a lot
350.32	of intelligence on the tool side.
353	But basically, this is the editor
354.6	where we're going to design
354.6	the next generation.
356.902	So it has a little spine.
356.902	I can move around, I can extend.
359.96	I can also inflate or deflate it
359.96	with the mouse wheel,
362.52	so you sculpt it like clay.
363.88	We have parts here
363.88	that I can put on or pull off.
366.24	The idea is that the player
366.24	can basically design
368.52	anything they can think of in this editor,
370.56	and we'll basically bring it to life.
372.4	So I might put some limbs
372.4	on the character here.
374.68	I'll inflate them kind of large.
376.28	And in this case
376.28	I might decide I'm going to put --
380.92	I'll put mouths on the limbs.
385.88	So pretty much players are encouraged
385.88	to be very creative in the game.
390.12	Here, I'll give it one eye in the middle,
390.12	maybe scale it up a bit. Point it down.
394.44	And I'll also give it a few legs.
399.12	So in some sense
400.36	we want this to feel like an amplifier
400.36	for the player's imagination,
403.8	so that with a very small number of clicks
403.8	a player can create something
407.56	that they didn't really think
407.56	was possible before.
409.96	This is almost like designing
409.96	something like Maya --
412.44	that an eight-year-old can use.
413.96	But really the goal here was,
415.4	within about a minute,
415.4	I wanted somebody to replicate
417.92	what typically takes a pictorial artist
417.92	several weeks to create.
421.2	OK, now I'll put some hands on it.
423.16	OK, so here I've basically
423.16	thrown together a little creature.
426.08	Let me give it a little weapon
426.08	on the tail here, so it can fight.
429.88	OK, so that's the complete model.
431.52	Now we can actually
431.52	go to the painting phase.
433.68	At this phase, the program
433.68	has some understanding
436.2	of the topology of this creature.
437.84	It knows where the backbone is,
437.84	where the spine, the limbs are,
440.9	how stripes should run,
440.9	how it should be shaded.
443.18	And so we're procedurally
443.18	generating the texture map,
445.7	something a texture artist
445.7	would take many days to work on.
448.6	And then we can test it out,
448.6	and see how it would move around.
451.56	And so at this point the computer
451.56	is procedurally animating this creature.
455.08	It's looking at whatever I've designed.
455.08	It will actually bring it to life.
458.6	And I can see how it might dance.
460.2	(Laughter)
461.44	How it might show emotions,
461.44	how it might fight.
465.64	So it's acting with its two mouths there.
467.64	I can even have it pose for a photo.
469.52	Snap a little photo of it.
471	(Laughter)
473	So then I bring this back into the game.
475.04	It's born, and I play the next generation
475.04	of my creature through evolution.
478.6	Now again, the empathy
478.6	that the players have
481.08	when they create
481.08	the content is tremendous.
483.12	When players create content in this game,
483.12	it's automatically sent up to a server
486.92	and then redistributed
486.92	to all the other players transparently.
489.88	So in fact, as I'm interacting
489.88	in this world with other creatures,
493.04	these creatures are transparently
493.04	coming from other players as they play.
496.96	So the process of playing the game
498.64	is a process of building up
498.64	this huge database of content.
501.52	And pretty much everything
501.52	you're going to see in this game,
504.4	there's an editor for
504.4	that the player can create,
507.08	up through civilization.
508.703	This is my baby. When I eat,
508.703	I'll actually start growing.
511.42	This is the next generation.
511.42	But I'm going to skip ahead here.
514.48	Normally what would happen is
514.48	these creatures would work their way up,
517.84	eventually become intelligent.
519.32	I'd start dealing with tribes, cities
519.32	and civilizations of them over time.
522.84	I'm going to skip way ahead
522.84	to the space phase.
525.08	Eventually they would go out into space,
527.04	and start colonizing
527.04	and exploring the universe.
530.68	Now, really, in some sense,
532.382	I want the players to be building
532.382	this world in their imagination,
535.68	and then extracting it from them
535.68	with the least amount of pain.
538.72	So that's kind of
538.72	what these tools are about.
540.88	How do we make the gameplay,
543.159	you know, basically
543.159	the player's imagination amplifier?
546.36	And how do we make
546.36	these tools, these editors,
549.09	something that are just as fun
549.09	as the game itself?
552.12	So this is the planet
552.12	that we've been playing on
554.4	up to this point in the game.
556.08	So far the entire game has been played
556.08	on the surface of this little world here.
559.88	At this point we're actually
559.88	dealing with a very little toy planet.
563.08	Almost, again,
563.08	like the Montessori toy idea.
565.2	What happens if you give
565.2	somebody a toy planet,
567.44	and let them play
567.44	with a lot of dynamics on it?
569.68	What could they discover?
569.68	What might they learn on this?
572.36	This world was actually extracted
572.36	from the player's imagination.
575.4	So, this is the planet
575.4	that the player evolved on.
577.8	Things like the buildings, the vehicles,
577.8	the architecture, civilizations
581.24	were all designed by the player
581.24	up to this point.
583.6	So here's a little city with some
583.6	of our guys walking around in it.
586.8	And most games put the player
586.8	in the role of Luke Skywalker,
589.68	this protagonist
589.68	playing through this story.
591.8	This is more about putting the player
591.8	in the role of George Lucas.
594.96	I want them, after they've
594.96	played this game,
597.08	to have extracted an entire world
597.08	that they're now interacting with.
600.32	As we pull down here,
601.56	we still have a whole set of creatures
601.56	living on the surface of the planet.
605.12	All these different
605.12	dynamics going on here.
607.16	I can look over here, and this is
607.16	a little simplified food web
610.12	that's going on with the creatures.
611.84	I can open this up and then scan
611.84	what exists on the surface.
614.72	You get some sense of the diversity
614.72	of creatures that were brought in.
618.1	Some of these were created by the player,
620.1	others by other players,
620.1	automatically sent over here.
622.72	But there's a very simple
622.72	calculation of what's required,
625.46	how many plants are required
625.46	for the herbivores to live,
628.14	how many herbivores
628.14	for the carnivores to eat, etc.,
630.62	that you have to balance actively.
632.3	Also with this phase,
633.54	we're getting more and more
633.54	God-like powers for the player,
636.34	and you can experiment
636.34	with this planet as a toy.
638.68	So I can come in and I can do things,
640.48	and just treat this planet
640.48	as a lump of clay.
642.6	We have very simple
642.6	weather systems, simple geology.
645.081	For instance, I could open one of my tools
645.081	here and then carve out rivers.
649.92	So this whole thing is kind of
649.92	like a big lump of clay, a sculpture.
653.16	I can also play with the dynamics
653.16	in this world over time.
655.92	So one of the things I can do
657.36	is start pumping more CO2 gases
657.36	into the atmosphere,
660.76	and so that's what I'm doing here.
662.44	There's actually
662.44	a little readout down there
664.56	of our planetary atmosphere,
664.56	pressure and temperature.
667.88	So as I start pumping in more atmosphere,
669.88	we're going to start pushing up
669.88	the greenhouse gases here
672.6	and if you'll start noticing,
674.04	we start seeing
674.04	the ocean levels rise over time.
676.88	And our cities
676.88	are going to be at risk too,
678.96	because a lot of these are coastal cities.
681	You can see the ocean levels
681	are rising now
683.04	and as they encroach upon the cities,
683.04	I'll start losing cities here.
686.34	So basically, I want the players
686.34	to be able to experiment and explore
689.62	a huge amount of failure space.
691.18	So there goes one city.
693.467	Now, over time, this is
693.467	going to heat up the planet.
695.92	So at first what we're going to see
697.64	is a global ocean rise
697.64	here on this little toy planet,
700.2	but then over time --
700.2	I can speed it up --
702.241	we'll see the heat impact of that as well.
704.362	Not only will it get hotter,
706.289	but at some point it's going to get so hot
706.289	the oceans will evaporate.
709.63	They'll go up, and then they'll evaporate,
709.63	and that'll be my planet.
712.971	So basically, what we're getting here
714.772	"is the sequel to ""An Inconvenient Truth,"""
714.772	in about two minutes,
717.773	and that actually brings up
717.773	an interesting point about games.
720.934	Now here, our entire oceans
720.934	are evaporating off the surface,
725.12	and as it keeps getting hotter,
726.68	at some point the entire planet
726.68	is going to melt down. Here it goes.
730.24	So we're not only
730.24	simulating biological dynamics --
732.68	food webs and all that --
733.92	but also geologic, you know,
733.92	on a very simple core scale.
736.64	And what's interesting to me about games
738.569	is that I think we can take
738.569	a lot of long-term dynamics
741.2	and compress them
741.2	into very short-term experiences.
744.24	Because it's so hard for people
744.24	to think 50 or 100 years out,
747.16	but when you can give them a toy,
748.8	and they can experience these
748.8	long-term dynamics in just a few minutes,
752.16	I think it's an entirely
752.16	different point of view,
754.52	where we're actually using the game
754.52	to remap our intuition.
757.32	It's almost in the same way
758.68	that a telescope or microscope
758.68	recalibrates your eyesight;
761.44	I think computer simulations
761.44	can recalibrate your instinct
764.2	across vast scales of both space and time.
766.224	So here's our little solar system,
767.88	as we pull away
767.88	from our melted planet here.
770	We actually have a couple
770	of other planets in this solar system.
773.08	Let's fly to another one.
774.32	We're going to have this unlimited
774.32	number of worlds you can explore here.
777.8	As we move into the future,
779.16	and we start going out
779.16	into space and doing stuff,
781.56	we're drawing a lot
781.56	from things like science fiction.
784.08	And all my favorite science fiction movies
786.12	I want to play out here
786.12	as different dynamics.
788.32	This planet actually has some life on it.
790.32	Here it is, some indigenous
790.32	life down here.
792.36	One of the tools
792.36	I can eventually earn for my UFO
794.72	is a monolith that I can drop down.
796.44	(Laughter)
798.96	Now, as you can see,
801	these guys are actually
801	starting to go up and bow to it,
804.32	and over time, once they touch it,
804.32	they will become intelligent.
807.36	So I can actually
807.36	pick a species on a planet
809.48	and then make them sentient.
810.88	Now they've actually
810.88	gone to tribal dynamics.
813.04	And now, because
813.04	I'm actually the one here,
815.08	I can get out of the UFO and walk up,
816.92	and they should be worshipping me
816.92	at this point as a god.
820.04	At first they're a little freaked out.
826.536	OK, well maybe they're not worshipping me.
828.56	(Laughter)
829.6	I think I'll leave
829.6	before they get hostile.
832.72	But we basically want
832.72	a diversity of activities
834.96	the players can play through this.
836.64	I want to be able to play
837.92	"""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"""
837.92	"""2001: A Space Odyssey,"""
840.64	"""Star Trek,"" ""War Of the Worlds."""
842.28	Now, as we pull away from this world --
844.28	we're going to keep
844.28	pulling away from the star now.
846.72	One of the things that always
846.72	frustrated me about astronomy
849.56	when I was a kid
850.8	is how it was always presented
850.8	so two-dimensionally and so static.
853.96	As we pull away from the star here,
855.68	we're actually going now
855.68	out into interstellar space,
858.2	and we're getting a sense
858.2	of the space around our home star.
861.08	What I really wanted to do
861.08	is to present this, basically,
863.8	as wonderfully 3D as it is actually is.
866.12	And also show the dynamics,
868.12	and a lot of the interesting objects
868.12	that you might find, like, in the Hubble,
871.84	at pretty much realistic
871.84	frequencies and scales.
874.12	So most people
874.12	have no idea of the difference
876.28	between an emission nebula
876.28	and a planetary nebula.
878.68	But these are the things
879.96	that we can put
879.96	in this little galaxy here.
882.04	So we're flying over here
882.04	to what looks like a black hole.
884.8	I want to basically have
884.8	the entire zoo of Hubble objects
887.52	that people can interact with
887.52	and play with, again, as toys.
890.4	So here's a little black hole
891.84	that we probably
891.84	don't want to get too close to.
895.12	But we also have stars and things as well.
897.16	If we pull all the way back,
897.16	we start seeing the entire galaxy here,
900.64	kind of slowly in motion.
902.6	Typically, when people present galaxies,
905.84	it's always beautiful photos,
905.84	but they're always static.
908.547	And when you bring it forward in time
908.547	and start animating it,
911.46	it's amazing what a galaxy
911.46	would look like fast forwarded.
914.278	This would be about
914.278	a million years a second,
916.459	because you have about
916.459	one supernova every century.
919.08	And so you'd have
919.08	this wonderful sparkling thing,
921.44	with the disk slowly rotating,
922.92	and this is roughly
922.92	what it would look like.
925.04	Part of this is about bringing
925.04	the beauty of the natural world
928.06	to somebody in a very imaginative way,
929.94	so that they can start
929.94	calibrating their instinct
932.3	across these vast scales
932.3	of space and time.
934.38	Chris was wondering what kind of gods
934.38	the players would become.
938.64	Because if you think about it,
940.12	you're going to have 15-year-olds,
943.74	They might be a nurturing god.
945.22	They might be bootstrapping
945.22	life on planets,
947.34	trying to terraform
947.34	and spread civilization.
949.46	You might be a vengeful god, conquesting,
951.72	because you actually can do that,
951.72	you can attack other intelligent races.
955.2	You might be a networking god,
955.2	building alliances,
958.246	or just curious, going around and wanting
958.246	to explore as much as you possibly can.
962.682	But basically, the reason
962.682	why I make toys like this
966.451	is because I think
966.451	if there's one difference
968.737	I could possibly make in the world,
971.48	that I would choose to make,
972.88	it's that I would like
972.88	to somehow give people
975.04	just a little bit better calibration
975.04	on long-term thinking.
977.88	Because I think most of the problems
977.88	that our world is facing right now
981.24	are the result of short-term thinking,
983.08	and the fact that it is so hard for us
983.08	to think 50, 100, or 1,000 years out.
987.28	And I think by giving kids toys like this
987.28	and letting them replay dynamics,
990.96	very long-term dynamics
990.96	over the short term,
993.08	and getting some sense
993.08	of what we're doing now,
995.32	what it's going to be like in 100 years,
997.28	I think probably is the most effective
997.28	thing I can be doing to help the world.
1001.28	And so that's why I think
1001.28	that toys can change the world.
1003.971	Thank you.
