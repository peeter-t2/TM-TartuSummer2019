12.737	When I was about three or four years old,
17.027	I remember my mum reading a story to me
20.909	and my two big brothers,
23.624	and I remember putting up my hands
25.643	to feel the page of the book,
27.646	to feel the picture they were discussing.
31.177	"And my mum said, ""Darling,"
33.626	remember that you can't see
36.479	and you can't feel the picture
39.525	"and you can't feel the print on the page."""
42.462	And I thought to myself,
44.236	"""But that's what I want to do."
46.131	"I love stories. I want to read."""
50.292	Little did I know
52.554	that I would be part of a technological revolution
55.073	that would make that dream come true.
58.774	I was born premature by about 10 weeks,
62.191	which resulted in my blindness, some 64 years ago.
66.836	The condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia,
69.706	and it's now very rare in the developed world.
73.591	Little did I know, lying curled up
76.5	in my prim baby humidicrib in 1948
81.293	that I'd been born at the right place
84.121	and the right time,
86.686	that I was in a country where I could participate
90.57	in the technological revolution.
93.503	There are 37 million totally blind people on our planet,
98.944	but those of us who've shared in the technological changes
102.168	mainly come from North America, Europe,
105.172	Japan and other developed parts of the world.
109.597	Computers have changed the lives of us all in this room
112.77	and around the world,
113.673	but I think they've changed the lives
115.34	of we blind people more than any other group.
118.883	And so I want to tell you about the interaction
122.161	between computer-based adaptive technology
125.213	and the many volunteers who helped me over the years
129.875	to become the person I am today.
133.276	It's an interaction between volunteers,
135.91	passionate inventors and technology,
138.831	and it's a story that many other blind people could tell.
141.766	But let me tell you a bit about it today.
146.181	When I was five, I went to school and I learned braille.
150.007	It's an ingenious system of six dots
152.531	that are punched into paper,
154.265	and I can feel them with my fingers.
157.652	In fact, I think they're putting up my grade six report.
160.828	I don't know where Julian Morrow got that from.
163.553	(Laughter)
165.109	I was pretty good in reading,
166.93	but religion and musical appreciation needed more work.
171.89	(Laughter)
173.366	When you leave the opera house,
175.453	you'll find there's braille signage in the lifts.
178.862	Look for it. Have you noticed it?
182.579	I do. I look for it all the time.
185.309	(Laughter)
187.395	When I was at school,
189.734	the books were transcribed by transcribers,
193.026	voluntary people who punched one dot at a time
195.859	so I'd have volumes to read,
197.527	and that had been going on, mainly by women,
199.986	since the late 19th century in this country,
202.659	but it was the only way I could read.
205.143	When I was in high school,
207.537	I got my first Philips reel-to-reel tape recorder,
211.343	and tape recorders became my sort of pre-computer
214.732	medium of learning.
216.912	I could have family and friends read me material,
220.051	and I could then read it back
222.444	as many times as I needed.
225	And it brought me into contact
226.52	with volunteers and helpers.
228.53	For example, when I studied at graduate school
233.022	at Queen's University in Canada,
235.259	the prisoners at the Collins Bay jail agreed to help me.
239.342	I gave them a tape recorder, and they read into it.
242.147	As one of them said to me,
243.433	"""Ron, we ain't going anywhere at the moment."""
246.192	(Laughter)
248.653	But think of it. These men,
250.958	who hadn't had the educational opportunities I'd had,
254.905	helped me gain post-graduate qualifications in law
259.181	by their dedicated help.
262.6	Well, I went back and became an academic
264.961	at Melbourne's Monash University,
267.603	and for those 25 years,
271.113	tape recorders were everything to me.
273.926	In fact, in my office in 1990,
276.377	I had 18 miles of tape.
280.904	Students, family and friends all read me material.
287.809	Mrs. Lois Doery,
289.346	whom I later came to call my surrogate mum,
292.324	read me many thousands of hours onto tape.
295.976	One of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today
298.44	was that I was hoping that Lois would be here
300.929	so I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her.
304.966	But sadly, her health hasn't permitted her to come today.
308.715	But I thank you here, Lois, from this platform.
313.303	(Applause)
325.776	I saw my first Apple computer in 1984,
332.635	and I thought to myself,
334.16	"""This thing's got a glass screen, not much use to me."""
339.128	How very wrong I was.
343.182	In 1987, in the month our eldest son Gerard was born,
347.715	I got my first blind computer,
350.169	and it's actually here.
353.383	See it up there?
355.318	And you see it has no, what do you call it, no screen.
359.601	(Laughter)
363.919	It's a blind computer.
365.913	(Laughter)
367.813	It's a Keynote Gold 84k,
370.418	and the 84k stands for it had 84 kilobytes of memory.
374.594	(Laughter)
377.495	Don't laugh, it cost me 4,000 dollars at the time. (Laughter)
382.433	I think there's more memory in my watch.
387.127	It was invented by Russell Smith, a passionate inventor
390.147	in New Zealand who was trying to help blind people.
392.945	Sadly, he died in a light plane crash in 2005,
396.747	but his memory lives on in my heart.
399.605	It meant, for the first time,
401.857	I could read back what I had typed into it.
405.188	It had a speech synthesizer.
407.145	I'd written my first coauthored labor law book
409.405	on a typewriter in 1979 purely from memory.
414.231	This now allowed me to read back what I'd written
418.542	and to enter the computer world,
420.22	even with its 84k of memory.
423.62	In 1974, the great Ray Kurzweil, the American inventor,
429.008	worked on building a machine that would scan books
431.758	and read them out in synthetic speech.
434.289	Optical character recognition units then
436.836	only operated usually on one font,
439.576	but by using charge-coupled device flatbed scanners
443.92	and speech synthesizers,
445.426	he developed a machine that could read any font.
449.832	And his machine, which was as big as a washing machine,
452.963	was launched on the 13th of January, 1976.
456.937	I saw my first commercially available Kurzweil
460.02	in March 1989, and it blew me away,
463.327	and in September 1989,
466.117	the month that my associate professorship
469.31	at Monash University was announced,
471.282	the law school got one, and I could use it.
475.14	For the first time, I could read what I wanted to read
479.173	by putting a book on the scanner.
480.581	I didn't have to be nice to people!
483.297	(Laughter)
485.94	I no longer would be censored.
488.089	For example, I was too shy then,
491.13	and I'm actually too shy now, to ask anybody
493.602	to read me out loud sexually explicit material.
496.415	(Laughter)
500.387	But, you know, I could pop a book on in the middle of the night, and --
503.875	(Laughter) (Applause)
513.528	Now, the Kurzweil reader is simply
516.712	a program on my laptop.
518.996	That's what it's shrunk to.
520.34	And now I can scan the latest novel
522.43	and not wait to get it into talking book libraries.
524.635	I can keep up with my friends.
527.896	There are many people who have helped me in my life,
531.136	and many that I haven't met.
533.767	One is another American inventor Ted Henter.
537.416	Ted was a motorcycle racer,
539.788	but in 1978 he had a car accident and lost his sight,
544.02	which is devastating if you're trying to ride motorbikes.
547.579	He then turned to being a waterskier
550.375	and was a champion disabled waterskier.
553.887	But in 1989, he teamed up with Bill Joyce
557.134	to develop a program that would read out
561.269	what was on the computer screen
563.02	from the Net or from what was on the computer.
565.024	It's called JAWS, Job Access With Speech,
568.531	and it sounds like this.
570.535	(JAWS speaking)
581.985	Ron McCallum: Isn't that slow?
583.748	(Laughter)
584.718	You see, if I read like that, I'd fall asleep.
586.986	I slowed it down for you.
588.195	I'm going to ask that we play it at the speed I read it.
591.467	Can we play that one?
593.982	(JAWS speaking)
607.809	(Laughter)
609.832	RM: You know, when you're marking student essays,
611.653	you want to get through them fairly quickly.
613.57	(Laughter) (Applause)
623.139	This technology that fascinated me in 1987
626.722	is now on my iPhone and on yours as well.
630.443	But, you know, I find reading with machines
633.977	a very lonely process.
636.39	I grew up with family, friends, reading to me,
641.329	and I loved the warmth and the breath
644.248	and the closeness of people reading.
646.602	Do you love being read to?
648.875	And one of my most enduring memories
651.675	is in 1999, Mary reading to me and the children
657.124	down near Manly Beach
659.52	"""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone."""
662.925	Isn't that a great book?
665.228	I still love being close to someone reading to me.
668.06	But I wouldn't give up the technology,
669.821	because it's allowed me to lead a great life.
675.111	Of course, talking books for the blind
677.798	predated all this technology.
679.41	After all, the long-playing record was developed
682.889	in the early 1930s,
684.278	and now we put talking books on CDs
686.967	using the digital access system known as DAISY.
692.53	But when I'm reading with synthetic voices,
695.712	I love to come home and read a racy novel
698.662	with a real voice.
702.612	Now there are still barriers
704.684	in front of we people with disabilities.
706.677	Many websites we can't read using JAWS
709.595	and the other technologies.
710.882	Websites are often very visual,
713.086	and there are all these sorts of graphs
714.533	that aren't labeled and buttons that aren't labeled,
717.484	and that's why the World Wide Web Consortium 3,
721.281	known as W3C, has developed worldwide standards
726.844	for the Internet.
728.258	And we want all Internet users or Internet site owners
733.688	to make their sites compatible so that
735.91	we persons without vision can have a level playing field.
740.586	There are other barriers brought about by our laws.
744.641	For example, Australia,
747.19	like about one third of the world's countries,
749.682	has copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailled
754.226	or read for we blind persons.
756.398	But those books can't travel across borders.
759.618	For example, in Spain, there are a 100,000
762.4	accessible books in Spanish.
764.426	In Argentina, there are 50,000.
766.804	In no other Latin American country
768.583	are there more than a couple of thousand.
770.66	But it's not legal to transport the books
772.765	from Spain to Latin America.
775.59	There are hundreds of thousands of accessible books
778.347	in the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, etc.,
781.223	but they can't be transported to the 60 countries
783.912	in our world where English is the first and the second language.
786.886	And remember I was telling you about Harry Potter.
790.297	Well, because we can't transport books across borders,
793.411	there had to be separate versions read
795.335	in all the different English-speaking countries:
798.264	Britain, United States, Canada, Australia,
801.315	and New Zealand all had to have
803.396	separate readings of Harry Potter.
806.139	And that's why, next month in Morocco,
809.253	a meeting is taking place between all the countries.
811.752	It's something that a group of countries
813.155	and the World Blind Union are advocating,
815.283	a cross-border treaty
817.601	so that if books are available under a copyright exception
820.739	and the other country has a copyright exception,
822.708	we can transport those books across borders
825.106	and give life to people, particularly in developing countries,
828.322	blind people who don't have the books to read.
832.247	I want that to happen.
834.359	(Applause)
842.598	My life has been extraordinarily blessed
845.863	with marriage and children
848.497	and certainly interesting work to do,
851.576	whether it be at the University of Sydney Law School,
854.23	where I served a term as dean,
855.502	or now as I sit on the United Nations Committee
859.023	on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in Geneva.
862.163	I've indeed been a very fortunate human being.
867.158	I wonder what the future will hold.
870.166	The technology will advance even further,
873.857	but I can still remember my mum saying, 60 years ago,
877.525	"""Remember, darling,"
879.459	"you'll never be able to read the print with your fingers."""
883.604	I'm so glad that the interaction between braille transcribers,
888.781	volunteer readers and passionate inventors,
891.678	has allowed this dream of reading to come true for me
894.868	and for blind people throughout the world.
897.872	I'd like to thank my researcher Hannah Martin,
901.518	who is my slide clicker, who clicks the slides,
904.488	and my wife, Professor Mary Crock, who's the light of my life,
908.879	is coming on to collect me.
910.237	I want to thank her too.
911.432	I think I have to say goodbye now.
913.432	Bless you. Thank you very much.
915.003	(Applause)
916.727	Yay! (Applause)
932.602	Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. (Applause)
