12.937	How many people here would like to live
12.937	to be at least 80 years old?
17.892	Yeah.
19.391	I think we all have
19.391	this hopeful expectation
22.21	of living into old age.
24.648	Let's project out into the future,
26.758	"to your future ""you's,"""
28.342	and let's imagine that we're all 85.
31.714	Now, everyone look at two people.
34.971	One of you probably has
34.971	Alzheimer's disease.
39.185	(Laughter)
42.633	Alright, alright.
44.774	And maybe you're thinking,
44.774	"""Well, it won't be me."""
49.17	Then, OK. You are a caregiver.
53.208	So --
54.396	(Laughter)
57.292	so in some way,
58.673	this terrifying disease
58.673	is likely to affect us all.
62.753	Part of the fear around Alzheimer's
62.753	stems from the sense
65.791	that there's nothing we can do about it.
68.229	Despite decades of research, we still
68.229	have no disease-modifying treatment
73.378	and no cure.
75.141	So if we're lucky enough
75.141	to live long enough,
77.634	Alzheimer's appears to be
77.634	our brain's destiny.
81.189	But maybe it doesn't have to be.
83.405	What if I told you we could
83.405	change these statistics,
86.794	literally change our brain's destiny,
89.508	without relying on a cure
89.508	or advancements in medicine?
93.803	Let's begin by looking at
93.803	what we currently understand
96.352	about the neuroscience of Alzheimer's.
99.55	Here's a picture
99.55	of two neurons connecting.
102.583	The point of connection,
102.583	this space circled in red,
105.964	is called the synapse.
107.627	The synapse is where
107.627	neurotransmitters are released.
110.843	This is where signals are transmitted,
110.843	where communication happens.
115.135	This is where we think,
115.135	feel, see, hear, desire ...
120.265	and remember.
121.938	And the synapse
121.938	is where Alzheimer's happens.
124.86	Let's zoom in on the synapse
126.846	and look at a cartoon representation
126.846	of what's going on.
130.619	During the business
130.619	of communicating information,
132.93	in addition to releasing neurotransmitters
132.93	like glutamate into the synapse,
136.952	neurons also release a small peptide
136.952	called amyloid beta.
142.437	Normally, amyloid beta is cleared away
142.437	metabolized by microglia,
147.445	the janitor cells of our brains.
150.225	While the molecular causes
150.225	of Alzheimer's are still debated,
154.108	most neuroscientists believe
154.108	that the disease begins
157.386	when amyloid beta begins to accumulate.
160.787	Too much is released,
160.787	or not enough is cleared away,
163.56	and the synapse begins
163.56	to pile up with amyloid beta.
166.918	And when this happens, it binds to itself,
169.161	forming sticky aggregates
169.161	called amyloid plaques.
173.402	How many people here
173.402	are 40 years old or older?
177.004	You're afraid to admit it now.
179.548	This initial step into the disease,
181.798	this presence of amyloid
181.798	plaques accumulating,
184.906	can already be found in your brains.
188.091	The only way we could be sure of this
188.091	would be through a PET scan,
191.585	because at this point,
191.585	you are blissfully unaware.
195.425	You're not showing any impairments
195.425	in memory, language, or cognition ...
199.738	yet.
201.291	We think it takes at least 15 to 20 years
201.291	of amyloid plaque accumulation
205.852	before it reaches a tipping point,
208.257	then triggering a molecular cascade
210.516	that causes the clinical
210.516	symptoms of the disease.
213.63	Prior to the tipping point,
215.615	your lapses in memory
215.615	might include things like,
219.223	"""Why did I come in this room?"""
221.572	"or ""Oh ... what's his name?"""
224.299	"or ""Where did I put my keys?"""
227.373	Now, before you all
227.373	start freaking out again,
229.953	because I know half of you did at least
229.953	one of those in the last 24 hours --
235.375	these are all normal kinds of forgetting.
238.636	In fact, I would argue that these examples
240.973	might not even involve your memory,
242.974	because you didn't pay attention
242.974	to where you put your keys
245.89	in the first place.
247.259	After the tipping point,
248.961	the glitches in memory,
248.961	language and cognition are different.
252.508	Instead of eventually finding
252.508	your keys in your coat pocket
255.432	or on the table by the door,
257.458	you find them in the refrigerator,
260.196	or you find them and you think,
262.186	"""What are these for?"""
264.663	So what happens when amyloid plaques
264.663	accumulate to this tipping point?
269.895	Our microglia janitor cells
269.895	become hyper-activated,
273.238	releasing chemicals that cause
273.238	inflammation and cellular damage.
277.396	We think they might actually
277.396	start clearing away
280.015	the synapses themselves.
282.218	A crucial neural transport protein
282.218	"called ""tau"" becomes hyperphosphorylated"
286.69	and twists itself
286.69	"into something called ""tangles,"""
289.298	which choke off the neurons
289.298	from the inside.
292.357	By mid-stage Alzheimer's,
292.357	we have massive inflammation and tangles
296.215	and all-out war at the synapse
298.186	and cell death.
300.058	So if you were a scientist
300.058	trying to cure this disease,
303.17	at what point would you ideally
303.17	want to intervene?
306.954	Many scientists are betting big
306.954	on the simplest solution:
310.882	keep amyloid plaques
310.882	from reaching that tipping point,
314.74	which means that drug discovery is largely
314.74	focused on developing a compound
318.792	that will prevent, eliminate, or reduce
318.792	amyloid plaque accumulation.
324.679	So the cure for Alzheimer's will likely be
324.679	a preventative medicine.
329.892	We're going to have to take this pill
329.892	before we reach that tipping point,
333.345	before the cascade is triggered,
335.621	before we start leaving
335.621	our keys in the refrigerator.
339.201	We think this is why, to date,
339.201	these kinds of drugs have failed
342.898	in clinical trials --
344.159	not because the science wasn't sound,
346.628	but because the people in these trials
346.628	were already symptomatic.
350.786	It was too late.
352.542	Think of amyloid plaques as a lit match.
355.818	At the tipping point, the match
355.818	sets fire to the forest.
359.704	Once the forest is ablaze,
361.678	it doesn't do any good
361.678	to blow out the match.
364.184	You have to blow out the match
364.184	before the forest catches fire.
368.151	Even before scientists sort this out,
370.038	this information is actually
370.038	really good news for us,
372.93	because it turns out that the way we live
372.93	can influence the accumulation
376.998	of amyloid plaques.
378.251	And so there are things we can do
379.851	to keep us from reaching
379.851	that tipping point.
382.937	Let's picture your risk
382.937	of Alzheimer's as a see-saw scale.
386.849	We're going to pile
386.849	risk factors on one arm,
388.922	and when that arm hits the floor,
388.922	you are symptomatic
391.424	and diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
393.878	Let's imagine you're 50 years old.
396.621	You're not a spring chicken anymore,
398.38	so you've accumulated
398.38	some amyloid plaques with age.
401.476	Your scale is tipped a little bit.
404.143	Now let's look at your DNA.
406.356	We've all inherited our genes
406.356	from our moms and our dads.
409.932	Some of these genes will increase our risk
409.932	and some will decrease it.
414.034	"If you're like Alice in ""Still Alice,"""
416.247	you've inherited a rare genetic mutation
416.247	that cranks out amyloid beta,
420.822	and this alone will tip
420.822	your scale arm to the ground.
424.399	But for most of us, the genes we inherit
424.399	will only tip the arm a bit.
428.589	For example, APOE4 is a gene variant
428.589	that increases amyloid,
433.428	but you can inherit a copy of APOE4
433.428	from mom and dad
436.72	and still never get Alzheimer's,
439.135	which means that for most of us,
441.272	our DNA alone does not determine
441.272	whether we get Alzheimer's.
445.804	So what does?
447.302	We can't do anything about getting older
447.302	or the genes we've inherited.
451.118	So far, we haven't changed
451.118	our brain's destiny.
454.964	What about sleep?
457.098	In slow-wave deep sleep, our glial cells
457.098	rinse cerebral spinal fluid
461.204	throughout our brains,
462.444	clearing away metabolic waste
462.444	that accumulated in our synapses
466.04	while we were awake.
467.965	Deep sleep is like
467.965	a power cleanse for the brain.
471.466	But what happens if you shortchange
471.466	yourself on sleep?
475.241	Many scientists believe
476.797	that poor sleep hygiene might actually
476.797	be a predictor of Alzheimer's.
481.433	A single night of sleep deprivation
481.433	leads to an increase in amyloid beta.
487.23	And amyloid accumulation
487.23	has been shown to disrupt sleep,
490.68	which in turn causes
490.68	more amyloid to accumulate.
493.191	And so now we have
493.191	this positive feedback loop
495.691	that's going to accelerate
495.691	the tipping of that scale.
499.126	What else?
500.573	Cardiovascular health.
502.863	High blood pressure, diabetes,
502.863	obesity, smoking, high cholesterol,
506.632	have all been shown to increase our risk
506.632	of developing Alzheimer's.
510.792	Some autopsy studies have shown
512.707	that as many as 80 percent
512.707	of people with Alzheimer's
515.403	also had cardiovascular disease.
518.189	Aerobic exercise has been shown
518.189	in many studies to decrease amyloid beta
523.218	in animal models of the disease.
525.439	So a heart-healthy
525.439	Mediterranean lifestyle and diet
529.043	can help to counter
529.043	the tipping of this scale.
532.517	So there are many things we can do
534.89	to prevent or delay
534.89	the onset of Alzheimer's.
537.286	But let's say
537.286	you haven't done any of them.
540.031	Let's say you're 65;
542.509	there's Alzheimer's in your family,
542.509	so you've likely inherited a gene or two
546.199	that tips your scale arm a bit;
548.247	you've been burning the candle
548.247	at both ends for years;
551.003	you love bacon;
552.53	and you don't run unless
552.53	someone's chasing you.
554.777	(Laughter)
556.102	Let's imagine that your amyloid plaques
556.102	have reached that tipping point.
559.738	Your scale arm has crashed to the floor.
561.81	You've tripped the cascade,
563.515	setting fire to the forest,
565.105	causing inflammation, tangles,
565.105	and cell death.
568.957	You should be symptomatic for Alzheimer's.
571.64	You should be having trouble
571.64	finding words and keys
574.98	and remembering what I said
574.98	at the beginning of this talk.
578.737	But you might not be.
581	There's one more thing you can do
581	to protect yourself
583.502	from experiencing
583.502	the symptoms of Alzheimer's,
586.112	even if you have the full-blown disease
586.112	pathology ablaze in your brain.
590.627	It has to do with neural plasticity
590.627	and cognitive reserve.
595.081	Remember, the experience
595.081	of having Alzheimer's
597.482	is ultimately a result of losing synapses.
601.159	The average brain has
601.159	over a hundred trillion synapses,
604.56	which is fantastic;
604.56	we've got a lot to work with.
607.297	And this isn't a static number.
608.99	We gain and lose synapses all the time,
611.412	through a process
611.412	called neural plasticity.
614.239	Every time we learn something new,
616.335	we are creating and strengthening
616.335	new neural connections,
620.486	new synapses.
622.808	In the Nun Study,
	when the study began,
629.324	were followed for more than two decades.
631.657	They were regularly given
631.657	physical checkups and cognitive tests,
635.141	and when they died, their brains
635.141	were all donated for autopsy.
639.213	In some of these brains, scientists
639.213	discovered something surprising.
643.612	Despite the presence of plaques
643.612	and tangles and brain shrinkage --
648.212	what appeared to be
648.212	unquestionable Alzheimer's --
651.105	the nuns who had belonged
651.105	to these brains showed no signs
654.808	of having the disease
654.808	while they were alive.
658.001	How can this be?
659.829	We think it's because these nuns
659.829	had a high level of cognitive reserve,
663.98	which is a way of saying that they had
663.98	more functional synapses.
667.927	People who have more years
667.927	of formal education,
670.525	who have a high degree of literacy,
672.784	who engage regularly
672.784	in mentally stimulating activities,
676.387	all have more cognitive reserve.
678.892	They have an abundance
678.892	and a redundancy in neural connections.
683.043	So even if they have a disease
683.043	like Alzheimer's
685.747	compromising some of their synapses,
687.825	they've got many extra backup connections,
690.834	and this buffers them from noticing
690.834	that anything is amiss.
694.797	Let's imagine a simplified example.
697.083	Let's say you only know one thing
697.083	about a subject.
699.833	Let's say it's about me.
701.386	You know that Lisa Genova
701.386	"wrote ""Still Alice,"""
703.716	and that's the only thing
703.716	you know about me.
706.176	You have that single neural connection,
708.59	that one synapse.
710.56	Now imagine you have Alzheimer's.
712.745	You have plaques and tangles
712.745	and inflammation
715.102	and microglia devouring that synapse.
718.423	Now when someone asks you,
718.423	"""Hey, who wrote 'Still Alice?'"""
722.677	you can't remember,
723.946	because that synapse
723.946	is either failing or gone.
727.153	You've forgotten me forever.
729.58	But what if you had learned more about me?
732.23	Let's say you learned
732.23	four things about me.
734.343	Now imagine you have Alzheimer's,
736.212	and three of those synapses
736.212	are damaged or destroyed.
739.897	You still have a way
739.897	to detour the wreckage.
742.382	You can still remember my name.
745.103	So we can be resilient
745.103	to the presence of Alzheimer's pathology
749.053	through the recruitment
749.053	of yet-undamaged pathways.
752.18	And we create these pathways,
752.18	this cognitive reserve,
755.983	by learning new things.
758.275	Ideally, we want these new things
758.275	to be as rich in meaning as possible,
762.82	recruiting sight and sound
762.82	and associations and emotion.
768.218	So this really doesn't mean
768.218	doing crossword puzzles.
771.377	You don't want to simply retrieve
771.377	information you've already learned,
775.498	because this is like traveling
775.498	down old, familiar streets,
778.865	cruising neighborhoods you already know.
781.933	You want to pave new neural roads.
784.791	Building an Alzheimer's-resistant brain
787.327	means learning to speak Italian,
789.531	meeting new friends,
791.065	reading a book,
792.256	or listening to a great TED Talk.
795.103	And if, despite all of this, you are
795.103	someday diagnosed with Alzheimer's,
800.44	there are three lessons I've learned
800.44	from my grandmother
803.617	and the dozens of people I've come to know
803.617	living with this disease.
807.935	Diagnosis doesn't mean
807.935	you're dying tomorrow.
811.143	Keep living.
812.889	You won't lose your emotional memory.
815.279	You'll still be able
815.279	to understand love and joy.
818.809	You might not remember
818.809	what I said five minutes ago,
821.836	but you'll remember how I made you feel.
824.764	And you are more than what
824.764	you can remember.
828.064	Thank you.
829.377	(Applause)
