15.26	I got my start
18.26	in writing and research
20.26	as a surgical trainee,
23.26	as someone who was a long ways away
25.26	from becoming any kind of an expert at anything.
28.26	So the natural question you ask then at that point
31.26	is, how do I get good at what I'm trying to do?
33.26	And it became a question of,
35.26	how do we all get good
37.26	at what we're trying to do?
40.26	It's hard enough to learn to get the skills,
44.26	try to learn all the material you have to absorb
47.26	at any task you're taking on.
49.26	I had to think about how I sew and how I cut,
52.26	but then also how I pick the right person
54.26	to come to an operating room.
56.26	And then in the midst of all this
58.26	came this new context
60.26	for thinking about what it meant to be good.
62.26	In the last few years
64.26	we realized we were in the deepest crisis
67.26	of medicine's existence
69.26	due to something you don't normally think about
71.26	when you're a doctor
73.26	concerned with how you do good for people,
76.26	which is the cost
78.26	of health care.
80.26	There's not a country in the world
83.26	that now is not asking
85.26	whether we can afford what doctors do.
88.26	The political fight that we've developed
91.26	has become one around
93.26	whether it's the government that's the problem
96.26	or is it insurance companies that are the problem.
101.26	And the answer is yes and no;
105.26	it's deeper than all of that.
107.26	The cause of our troubles
109.26	is actually the complexity that science has given us.
112.26	And in order to understand this,
114.26	I'm going to take you back a couple of generations.
118.26	I want to take you back
120.26	"to a time when Lewis Thomas was writing in his book, ""The Youngest Science."""
123.26	Lewis Thomas was a physician-writer,
125.26	one of my favorite writers.
127.26	And he wrote this book to explain, among other things,
130.26	what it was like to be a medical intern
133.26	at the Boston City Hospital
135.26	in the pre-penicillin year
137.26	of 1937.
140.26	It was a time when medicine was cheap
144.26	and very ineffective.
148.26	If you were in a hospital, he said,
151.26	it was going to do you good
154.26	only because it offered you
156.26	some warmth, some food, shelter,
160.26	and maybe the caring attention
162.26	of a nurse.
164.26	Doctors and medicine
168.26	made no difference at all.
170.26	That didn't seem to prevent the doctors
172.26	from being frantically busy in their days,
174.26	as he explained.
176.26	What they were trying to do
178.26	was figure out whether you might have one of the diagnoses
181.26	for which they could do something.
184.26	And there were a few.
186.26	You might have a lobar pneumonia, for example,
189.26	and they could give you an antiserum,
191.26	an injection of rabid antibodies
195.26	to the bacterium streptococcus,
198.26	if the intern sub-typed it correctly.
202.26	If you had an acute congestive heart failure,
205.26	they could bleed a pint of blood from you
208.26	by opening up an arm vein,
211.26	giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis
214.26	and then giving you oxygen by tent.
219.26	If you had early signs of paralysis
221.26	and you were really good at asking personal questions,
224.26	you might figure out
226.26	that this paralysis someone has is from syphilis,
229.26	in which case you could give this nice concoction
232.26	of mercury and arsenic --
236.26	as long as you didn't overdose them and kill them.
241.26	Beyond these sorts of things,
243.26	a medical doctor didn't have a lot that they could do.
248.26	This was when the core structure of medicine
250.26	was created --
252.26	what it meant to be good at what we did
255.26	and how we wanted to build medicine to be.
257.26	It was at a time
259.26	when what was known you could know,
261.26	you could hold it all in your head, and you could do it all.
264.26	If you had a prescription pad,
266.26	if you had a nurse,
268.26	if you had a hospital
270.26	that would give you a place to convalesce, maybe some basic tools,
273.26	you really could do it all.
275.26	You set the fracture, you drew the blood,
278.26	you spun the blood,
280.26	looked at it under the microscope,
282.26	you plated the culture, you injected the antiserum.
285.26	This was a life as a craftsman.
290.26	As a result, we built it around
293.26	a culture and set of values
295.26	that said what you were good at
298.26	was being daring,
300.26	at being courageous,
302.26	at being independent and self-sufficient.
306.26	Autonomy was our highest value.
312.26	Go a couple generations forward
314.26	to where we are, though,
316.26	and it looks like a completely different world.
318.26	We have now found treatments
321.26	for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions
325.26	that a human being can have.
327.26	We can't cure it all.
329.26	We can't guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life.
332.26	But we can make it possible
334.26	for most.
337.26	But what does it take?
339.26	Well, we've now discovered
341.26	4,000 medical and surgical procedures.
345.26	We've discovered 6,000 drugs
348.26	that I'm now licensed to prescribe.
351.26	And we're trying to deploy this capability,
353.26	town by town,
355.26	to every person alive --
359.26	in our own country,
361.26	let alone around the world.
363.26	And we've reached the point where we've realized,
366.26	as doctors,
368.26	we can't know it all.
370.26	We can't do it all
373.26	by ourselves.
375.26	There was a study where they looked
377.26	at how many clinicians it took to take care of you
379.26	if you came into a hospital,
381.26	as it changed over time.
383.26	And in the year 1970,
385.26	it took just over two full-time equivalents of clinicians.
388.26	That is to say,
390.26	it took basically the nursing time
393.26	and then just a little bit of time for a doctor
395.26	who more or less checked in on you
397.26	once a day.
399.26	By the end of the 20th century,
402.26	it had become more than 15 clinicians
405.26	for the same typical hospital patient --
408.26	specialists, physical therapists,
411.26	the nurses.
414.26	We're all specialists now,
416.26	even the primary care physicians.
418.26	Everyone just has
420.26	a piece of the care.
423.26	But holding onto that structure we built
425.26	around the daring, independence,
427.26	self-sufficiency
429.26	of each of those people
432.26	has become a disaster.
434.26	We have trained, hired and rewarded people
438.26	to be cowboys.
441.26	But it's pit crews that we need,
444.26	pit crews for patients.
446.26	There's evidence all around us:
451.26	in our communities
453.26	receive incomplete or inappropriate care.
459.26	of our asthma, stroke patients
462.26	receive incomplete or inappropriate care.
466.26	Two million people come into hospitals
469.26	and pick up an infection
471.26	they didn't have
473.26	because someone failed to follow
476.26	the basic practices of hygiene.
479.26	Our experience
481.26	as people who get sick,
483.26	need help from other people,
485.26	is that we have amazing clinicians
488.26	that we can turn to --
490.26	hardworking, incredibly well-trained and very smart --
493.26	that we have access to incredible technologies
496.26	that give us great hope,
498.26	but little sense
500.26	that it consistently all comes together for you
504.26	from start to finish
507.26	in a successful way.
510.26	There's another sign
512.26	that we need pit crews,
514.26	and that's the unmanageable cost
517.26	of our care.
520.26	Now we in medicine, I think,
522.26	are baffled by this question of cost.
524.26	"We want to say, ""This is just the way it is."
528.26	"This is just what medicine requires."""
530.26	When you go from a world
532.26	where you treated arthritis with aspirin,
535.26	that mostly didn't do the job,
538.26	to one where, if it gets bad enough,
540.26	we can do a hip replacement, a knee replacement
542.26	that gives you years, maybe decades,
545.26	without disability,
547.26	a dramatic change,
549.26	well is it any surprise
551.26	that that $40,000 hip replacement
554.26	replacing the 10-cent aspirin
556.26	is more expensive?
558.26	It's just the way it is.
561.26	But I think we're ignoring certain facts
563.26	that tell us something about what we can do.
568.26	As we've looked at the data
570.26	about the results that have come
573.26	as the complexity has increased,
575.26	we found
577.26	that the most expensive care
579.26	is not necessarily the best care.
582.26	And vice versa,
584.26	the best care
586.26	often turns out to be the least expensive --
589.26	has fewer complications,
592.26	the people get more efficient at what they do.
595.26	And what that means
597.26	is there's hope.
600.26	Because [if] to have the best results,
603.26	you really needed the most expensive care
606.26	in the country, or in the world,
608.26	well then we really would be talking about rationing
611.26	who we're going to cut off from Medicare.
615.26	That would be really our only choice.
619.26	But when we look at the positive deviants --
621.26	the ones who are getting the best results
624.26	at the lowest costs --
626.26	we find the ones that look the most like systems
629.26	are the most successful.
631.26	That is to say, they found ways
634.26	to get all of the different pieces,
636.26	all of the different components,
638.26	to come together into a whole.
641.26	Having great components is not enough,
644.26	and yet we've been obsessed in medicine with components.
648.26	We want the best drugs, the best technologies,
651.26	the best specialists,
654.26	but we don't think too much
656.26	about how it all comes together.
659.26	It's a terrible design strategy actually.
663.26	There's a famous thought experiment
666.26	that touches exactly on this
668.26	that said, what if you built a car
670.26	from the very best car parts?
673.26	Well it would lead you to put in Porsche brakes,
676.26	a Ferrari engine,
678.26	a Volvo body, a BMW chassis.
681.26	And you put it all together and what do you get?
684.26	A very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere.
688.26	And that is what medicine can feel like sometimes.
693.26	It's not a system.
696.26	Now a system, however,
698.26	when things start to come together,
701.26	you realize it has certain skills
704.26	for acting and looking that way.
707.26	Skill number one
709.26	is the ability to recognize success
711.26	and the ability to recognize failure.
714.26	When you are a specialist,
716.26	you can't see the end result very well.
719.26	You have to become really interested in data,
722.26	unsexy as that sounds.
724.26	One of my colleagues is a surgeon in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
727.26	and he got interested in the question of,
731.26	well how many CT scans did they do
733.26	for their community in Cedar Rapids?
735.26	He got interested in this
737.26	because there had been government reports,
739.26	newspaper reports, journal articles
741.26	saying that there had been too many CT scans done.
744.26	He didn't see it in his own patients.
748.26	"And so he asked the question, ""How many did we do?"""
750.26	and he wanted to get the data.
752.26	It took him three months.
754.26	No one had asked this question in his community before.
757.26	And what he found was that,
759.26	for the 300,000 people in their community,
761.26	in the previous year
763.26	they had done 52,000 CT scans.
768.26	They had found a problem.
771.26	Which brings us to skill number two a system has.
776.26	Skill one, find where your failures are.
779.26	Skill two is devise solutions.
783.26	I got interested in this
785.26	when the World Health Organization came to my team
787.26	asking if we could help with a project
789.26	to reduce deaths in surgery.
791.26	The volume of surgery had spread
793.26	around the world,
795.26	but the safety of surgery
797.26	had not.
799.26	Now our usual tactics for tackling problems like these
802.26	are to do more training,
804.26	give people more specialization
807.26	or bring in more technology.
810.26	Well in surgery, you couldn't have people who are more specialized
813.26	and you couldn't have people who are better trained.
816.26	And yet we see unconscionable levels
819.26	of death, disability
823.26	that could be avoided.
825.26	And so we looked at what other high-risk industries do.
827.26	We looked at skyscraper construction,
829.26	we looked at the aviation world,
832.26	and we found
834.26	that they have technology, they have training,
836.26	and then they have one other thing:
839.26	They have checklists.
842.26	I did not expect
844.26	to be spending a significant part
846.26	of my time as a Harvard surgeon
848.26	worrying about checklists.
851.26	And yet, what we found
853.26	were that these were tools
856.26	to help make experts better.
859.26	We got the lead safety engineer for Boeing to help us.
863.26	Could we design a checklist for surgery?
866.26	Not for the lowest people on the totem pole,
868.26	but for the folks
870.26	who were all the way around the chain,
872.26	the entire team including the surgeons.
874.26	And what they taught us
876.26	was that designing a checklist
878.26	to help people handle complexity
880.26	actually involves more difficulty than I had understood.
883.26	You have to think about things
885.26	like pause points.
887.26	You need to identify the moments in a process
890.26	when you can actually catch a problem before it's a danger
892.26	and do something about it.
894.26	You have to identify
896.26	that this is a before-takeoff checklist.
899.26	And then you need to focus on the killer items.
902.26	An aviation checklist,
904.26	like this one for a single-engine plane,
906.26	isn't a recipe for how to fly a plane,
908.26	it's a reminder of the key things
910.26	that get forgotten or missed
913.26	if they're not checked.
915.26	So we did this.
917.26	We created a 19-item two-minute checklist
920.26	for surgical teams.
922.26	We had the pause points
924.26	immediately before anesthesia is given,
927.26	immediately before the knife hits the skin,
930.26	immediately before the patient leaves the room.
933.26	And we had a mix of dumb stuff on there --
936.26	making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame
939.26	because that cuts the infection rate by half --
941.26	and then interesting stuff,
943.26	because you can't make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery.
946.26	Instead, you can make a recipe
948.26	for how to have a team that's prepared for the unexpected.
951.26	And we had items like making sure everyone in the room
954.26	had introduced themselves by name at the start of the day,
957.26	because you get half a dozen people or more
959.26	who are sometimes coming together as a team
962.26	for the very first time that day that you're coming in.
965.26	We implemented this checklist
967.26	in eight hospitals around the world,
970.26	deliberately in places from rural Tanzania
972.26	to the University of Washington in Seattle.
975.26	We found that after they adopted it
978.26	the complication rates fell
982.26	It fell in every hospital it went into.
985.26	The death rates fell
990.26	This was bigger than a drug.
992.26	(Applause)
998.26	And that brings us
1000.26	to skill number three,
1003.26	the ability to implement this,
1005.26	to get colleagues across the entire chain
1008.26	to actually do these things.
1011.26	And it's been slow to spread.
1013.26	This is not yet our norm in surgery --
1017.26	let alone making checklists
1019.26	to go onto childbirth and other areas.
1022.26	There's a deep resistance
1024.26	because using these tools
1026.26	forces us to confront
1028.26	that we're not a system,
1030.26	forces us to behave with a different set of values.
1033.26	Just using a checklist
1035.26	requires you to embrace different values from the ones we've had,
1038.26	like humility,
1042.26	discipline,
1045.26	teamwork.
1047.26	This is the opposite of what we were built on:
1050.26	independence, self-sufficiency,
1052.26	autonomy.
1055.26	I met an actual cowboy, by the way.
1058.26	I asked him, what was it like
1061.26	to actually herd a thousand cattle
1063.26	across hundreds of miles?
1065.26	How did you do that?
1067.26	"And he said, ""We have the cowboys stationed at distinct places all around."""
1070.26	They communicate electronically constantly,
1073.26	and they have protocols and checklists
1075.26	for how they handle everything --
1077.26	(Laughter)
1079.26	-- from bad weather
1081.26	to emergencies or inoculations for the cattle.
1084.26	Even the cowboys are pit crews now.
1088.26	And it seemed like time
1090.26	that we become that way ourselves.
1092.26	Making systems work
1094.26	is the great task of my generation
1097.26	of physicians and scientists.
1099.26	But I would go further and say
1101.26	that making systems work,
1103.26	whether in health care, education,
1105.26	climate change,
1107.26	making a pathway out of poverty,
1109.26	is the great task of our generation as a whole.
1113.26	In every field, knowledge has exploded,
1116.26	but it has brought complexity,
1118.26	it has brought specialization.
1121.26	And we've come to a place where we have no choice
1123.26	but to recognize,
1125.26	as individualistic as we want to be,
1128.26	complexity requires
1131.26	group success.
1133.26	We all need to be pit crews now.
1137.26	Thank you.
1139.26	(Applause)
