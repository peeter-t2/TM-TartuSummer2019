25	I've been at MIT for 44 years.
27.92	I went to TED I.
29.88	There's only one other person here,
29.88	I think, who did that.
32.76	All the other TEDs --
34	and I went to them all,
34	under Ricky's regime --
36.28	I talked about
36.28	what the Media Lab was doing,
38.84	which today has almost 500 people in it.
41.88	And if you read the press,
43.32	last week it actually said
43.32	I quit the Media Lab.
46	I didn't quit the Media Lab,
46	I stepped down as chairman --
50.2	which was a kind of ridiculous title,
50.2	but someone else has taken it on --
54.92	and one of the things
54.92	you can do as a professor
57.135	is you stay on as a professor.
59	And I will now do for the rest of my life
59	the One Laptop Per Child,
63.28	which I've sort of been doing
63.28	for a year and a half, anyway.
66.32	So I'm going to tell you about this,
68.08	use my 18 minutes
68.08	to tell you why we're doing it,
72.2	how we're doing it
72.2	and then what we're doing.
74.4	And at some point I'll even pass around
77.72	what the $100 laptop might be like.
83.8	I was asked by Chris
83.8	to talk about some of the big issues,
86.68	and so I figured I'd start with the three
86.68	that at least drove me to do this.
91.96	And the first is pretty obvious.
94.8	It's amazing when you meet
94.8	a head of state, and you say,
97.48	"""What is your most precious"
97.48	"natural resource?"""
100.24	"They will not say ""children"" at first,"
102.96	"and then when you say, ""children,"""
102.96	they will pretty quickly agree with you.
107.239	And so that isn't very hard.
109.28	(Laughter)
112	Everybody agrees that whatever
112	the solutions are to the big problems,
117.08	they include education,
117.08	sometimes can be just education
121.84	and can never be without
121.84	some element of education.
125.16	So that's certainly part of it.
127	And the third
127	is a little bit less obvious.
129.4	And that is that we all in this room
129.4	learned how to walk, how to talk,
134.16	not by being taught how to talk,
134.16	or taught how to walk,
138.68	but by interacting with the world,
140.4	by having certain results as a consequence
140.4	of being able to ask for something,
144.56	or being able to stand up and reach it.
146.72	Whereas at about the age six,
146.72	we were told to stop learning that way,
151	and that all learning from then on
151	would happen through teaching,
154.36	whether it's people standing up,
154.36	like I'm doing now,
156.813	or a book, or something.
158.56	But it was really through teaching.
160.52	And one of the things in general
160.52	that computers have provided to learning
165.72	is that it now includes a kind of learning
168.88	which is a little bit more
168.88	like walking and talking,
172	in the sense that a lot of it is driven
172	by the learner himself or herself.
178.64	So with those as the principles --
181.4	some of you may know Seymour Papert.
183.44	This is back in 1982,
183.44	when we were working in Senegal.
187	Because some people think that
187	the $100 laptop just happened a year ago,
192.269	or two years ago,
192.269	or we were struck by lightning --
195.48	this actually has gone back a long time,
195.48	and in fact, back to the '60s.
200.56	Here we're in the '80s.
202.12	Steve Jobs had given us some laptops.
202.12	We were in Senegal.
206.4	It didn't scale
207.68	but it at least was bringing computers
207.68	to developing countries
212.8	and learning pretty quickly
212.8	that these kids,
215.28	even though English wasn't their language,
217.304	the Latin alphabet
217.304	barely was their language,
220.56	but they could just swim like fish.
222.92	They could play these like pianos.
226.36	A little bit more recently,
226.36	I got involved personally.
230.6	And these are two anecdotes --
232.36	one was in Cambodia,
235	in a village that has no electricity,
235	no water, no television, no telephone,
239.44	but has broadband Internet now.
241.6	And these kids,
241.6	"their first English word is ""Google"""
245.12	and they only know Skype.
247.48	They've never heard of telephony.
249.12	They just use Skype.
251.28	And they go home at night --
253.16	they've got a broadband connection
253.16	in a hut that doesn't have electricity.
257	The parents love it,
257	because when they open up the laptops,
259.786	it's the brightest light source
259.786	in the house.
262	And talk about
262	where metaphors and reality mix --
265.4	this is the actual school.
268.56	In parallel with this,
268.56	Seymour Papert got the governor of Maine
273.68	to legislate one laptop per child
273.68	in the year 2002.
279.2	Now at the time, I think it's fair to say
279.2	that 80 percent of the teachers were --
284.32	let me say, apprehensive.
285.92	Really, they were actually against it.
287.76	And they really preferred
287.76	that the money would be used
290.308	for higher salaries,
290.308	more schools, whatever.
292.72	And now, three and a half
292.72	years later, guess what?
297	They're reporting five things:
297	drop of truancy to almost zero,
303.24	attending parent-teacher meetings --
305.189	which nobody did
305.189	and now almost everybody does --
307.72	drop in discipline problems,
307.72	increase in student participation.
311.64	Teachers are now saying
311.64	it's kind of fun to teach.
314.08	Kids are engaged -- they have laptops! --
317.24	and then the fifth,
317.24	which interests me the most,
319.72	is that the servers have to be turned off
319.72	at certain times at night
322.96	because the teachers
322.96	are getting too much email
325.4	from the kids asking them for help.
327.4	So when you see that kind of thing --
329.2	this is not something
329.2	that you have to test.
331.272	The days of pilot projects are over,
331.272	when people say,
334	"""We'd like to do three or four thousand"
334	"in our country to see how it works."""
338.08	Screw you. Go to the back of the line
338.08	and someone else will do it,
341.2	and then when you figure out
341.2	that this works, you can join as well.
345.76	And this is what we're doing.
348.36	(Laughter) (Applause)
350.52	So, One Laptop Per Child
350.52	was formed about a year and a half ago.
355.52	It's a nonprofit association.
357.44	It raised about 20 million dollars
359.4	to do the engineering
359.4	to just get this built,
363.24	and then have it produced afterwards.
365.92	Scale is truly important.
368.2	And it's not important because you can
368.2	buy components at a lower price, OK?
374.52	It's because you can go
374.52	to a manufacturer --
377.42	and I will leave the name out --
379.086	but we wanted a small display,
382.64	doesn't have to have
382.64	perfect color uniformity.
386.44	It can even have a pixel or two missing.
388.826	It doesn't have to be that bright.
391.4	And this particular manufacturer said,
393.72	"""We're not interested in that."
393.72	We're interested in the living room.
396.887	We're interested
396.887	in perfect color uniformity.
399.08	We're interested in big displays,
399.08	bright displays.
401.44	"You're not part of our strategic plan."""
404.24	"And I said, ""That's kind of too bad,"
404.24	"because we need 100 million units a year."""
407.979	(Laughter)
409.574	"And they said, ""Oh, well, maybe we could"
409.574	"become part of your strategic plan."""
413.56	And that's why scale counts.
416	And that's why we will not launch this
418.28	without five to 10 million units
418.28	in the first run.
422.2	And the idea is
422.2	to launch with enough scale
425.2	that the scale itself
425.2	helps bring the price down,
427.8	and that's why I said
427.8	seven to 10 million there.
431.72	And we're doing it
431.72	without a sales-and-marketing team.
435.16	I mean, you're looking
435.16	at the sales-and-marketing team.
437.76	We will do it by going
437.76	to seven large countries
441.8	and getting them to agree and launch it,
444.348	and then the others can follow.
446.68	We have partners.
448.56	It's not hard to guess
448.56	Google would be one.
450.584	The others are all playing to pending.
454.24	And this has been
454.24	in the press a great deal.
457.12	It's the so-called Green Machine
457.12	that we introduced with Kofi Annan
463.04	in November at the World Summit
463.04	that was held in Tunisia.
467.36	Now once people start looking at this,
467.36	"they say, ""Ah, this is a laptop project."""
473	Well, no, it's not a laptop project.
473	It's an education project.
476.32	And the fun part --
476.32	and I'm quite focused on it --
480	I tell people I used to be a light bulb,
480	but now I'm a laser --
484.12	I'm just going to get that thing built,
484.12	and it turns out it's not so hard.
490.24	Because laptop economics
490.24	are the following:
493.48	I say 50 percent here --
493.48	it's more like 60,
498.08	is sales, marketing,
498.08	distribution and profit.
500.96	Now we have none of those, OK?
503.32	None of those figure into our cost,
506.28	because first of all, we sell it at cost,
506.28	and the governments distribute it.
510.52	It gets distributed
510.52	to the school system like a textbook.
514.8	So that piece disappears.
516.96	Then you have display and everything else.
519.8	Now the display on your laptop costs,
522.68	in rough numbers,
527.84	That can drop to eight;
527.84	it can drop to seven
530	but it's not going to drop to two,
530	or to one and a half,
533	unless we do some pretty clever things.
537.08	It's the rest -- that little brown box --
537.08	that is pretty fascinating,
541.28	because the rest of your laptop
541.28	is devoted to itself.
546.72	It's a little bit like an obese person
549.36	having to use most of their energy
549.36	to move their obesity.
552.52	(Laughter)
554	And we have a situation today
554	which is incredible.
559.8	I've been using laptops
559.8	since their inception.
562.8	And my laptop runs slower,
562.8	less reliably and less pleasantly
568.16	than it ever has before.
570.72	And this year is worse.
572.24	(Applause)
573.64	People clap, sometimes
573.64	you even get standing ovations,
576.96	"and I say, ""What the hell's wrong"
576.96	"with you? Why are we all sitting there?"""
580.68	And somebody -- to remain nameless --
580.68	"called our laptop a ""gadget"" recently."
587.04	"And I said, ""God, our laptop's going to go"
587.04	like a bat out of hell.
590.68	When you open it up,
590.68	"it's going to go 'bing.'"""
592.9	It'll be on.
594.2	It'll be just like it was in 1985,
598	when you bought an Apple Macintosh 512.
602.72	It worked really well.
604.48	And we've been going steadily downhill.
607.6	Now, people ask all the time what it is.
611.56	That's what it is.
613.64	The two pieces that are probably notable:
613.64	it'll be a mesh network,
618.96	so when the kids open up their laptops,
618.96	they all become a network,
622.6	and then just need
622.6	one or two points of backhaul.
625.44	You can serve a couple of thousand kids
625.44	with two megabits.
628.64	So you really can bring into a village,
631.72	and then the villages
631.72	can connect themselves,
634.04	and you really can do it quite well.
637.12	The dual mode display --
639.12	the idea is to have a display
639.12	that both works outdoors --
643.84	isn't it fun using your cell phone
643.84	outdoors in the sunlight?
647.28	Well, you can't see it.
648.84	And one of the reasons you can't see it
651.04	is because it's backlighting
651.04	most of the time, most cell phones.
655.12	Now, what we're doing is, we're doing one
655.12	that will be both frontlit and backlit.
659.8	And whether you manually switch it
659.8	or you do it in the software
663.6	is to be seen.
665.12	But when it's backlit, it's color.
667	And when it's frontlit,
667	it's black and white
669.08	at three times the resolution.
671.08	Is it all worked out? No.
673.56	That's why a lot of our people are
673.56	more or less living in Taiwan right now.
678.84	And in about 30 days,
678.84	we'll know for sure whether this works.
683.08	Probably the most important piece there
687.32	is that the kids
687.32	really can do the maintenance.
690.48	And this is again something
690.48	that people don't believe,
693.64	but I really think it's quite true.
696.88	That's the machine we showed in Tunis.
701.8	This is more the direction
701.8	that we're going to go.
704.6	And it's something
704.6	that we didn't think was possible.
707.96	Now, I'm going to pass this around.
711.32	This isn't a design, OK?
713.52	So this is just a mechanical
713.52	engineering sort of embodiment of it
718.24	for you to play with.
719.8	And it's clearly just a model.
721.68	The working one is at MIT.
724.4	I'm going to pass it
724.4	to this handsome gentleman.
727.28	At least you can decide
727.28	whether it goes left or --
729.76	Chris Anderson: Before you do it,
729.76	for the people down in simulcast --
733.084	Nicholas Negroponte: Sorry! I forgot.
733.084	CA: Just show it off a bit.
736.17	So wherever the camera is --
736.17	OK, good point. Thank you, Chris.
739.2	The idea was that
739.2	it would be not only a laptop,
742.8	but that it could transform
742.8	into an electronic book.
746.4	So it's sort of an electronic book.
748.091	This is where when you go outside,
748.091	it's in black and white.
750.877	The games buttons are missing,
752.68	but it'll also be a games machine,
754.999	book machine.
756.36	Set it up this way,
756.36	and it's a television set.
758.88	Etc., etc. -- is that enough
758.88	for simulcast? OK, sorry.
765.16	I'll let Jim decide
765.16	which way to send it afterwards.
768.04	OK. Seven countries.
769.76	(Laughter)
771.36	"I say ""maybe"" for Massachusetts,"
771.36	because they actually have to do a bid.
776.44	By law you've got to bid,
776.44	and so on and so forth.
779.12	So I can't quite name them.
780.56	In the other cases,
780.56	they don't have to do bids.
783.24	They can decide --
784.876	it's the federal government in each case.
786.96	It's kind of agonizing,
788.2	because a lot of people say,
788.2	"""Let's do it at the state level,"""
791.129	because states are more nimble
791.129	than the feds, just because of size.
796	And yet we count.
797.2	We're really dealing
797.2	with the federal government.
799.6	We're really dealing
799.6	with ministries of education.
801.96	And if you look at governments
801.96	around the world,
804.68	ministries of education
804.68	tend to be the most conservative,
808.44	and also the ones that have huge payrolls.
812.64	Everybody thinks
812.64	they know about education,
815.04	a lot of culture is built into it as well.
817.52	It's really hard.
817.52	And so it's certainly the hard road.
821.2	If you look at the countries,
821.2	they're pretty geoculturally distributed.
826	Have they all agreed? No, not completely.
828.52	Probably Thailand, Brazil and Nigeria
830.92	are the three that are
830.92	the most active and most agreed.
834.04	We're purposely
834.04	not signing anything with anybody
837.16	until we actually have the working ones.
839.48	And since I visit
839.48	each one of those countries
842.16	within at least every three months,
844.2	I'm just going around the world
844.2	every three weeks.
847.36	Here's sort of the schedule
848.92	and I put at the bottom we might give some
848.92	away free in two years at this meeting.
855.422	Everybody says it's a $100 laptop --
858.559	you can't do it.
859.734	Well, guess what, we're not.
861.16	We're coming in probably at 135,
861.16	to start, then drift down.
866.24	And that's very important,
867.72	because so many things hit the market
867.72	at a price and then drift up.
873.04	It's kind of the loss leader,
874.56	and then as soon as it looks interesting,
877.44	it can't be afforded,
877.44	or it can't be scaled out.
880.12	So we're targeting 50 dollars in 2010.
883.56	The gray market's a big issue.
885.36	And one of the ways -- just one --
887.76	but one of the ways to help
887.76	in the case of the gray market
891.84	is to make something
891.84	that is so utterly unique --
894.4	It's a little bit like the fact
894.4	that automobiles --
898.04	thousands of automobiles
898.04	are stolen every day in the United States.
901.72	Not one single
901.72	post-office truck is stolen.
904.68	(Laughter)
905.92	And why?
907.12	Because there's no market
907.12	for post-office trucks.
909.48	It looks like a post-office truck.
911.24	You can spray paint it.
911.24	You can do anything you want.
913.741	I just learned recently: in South Africa,
913.741	no white Volvos are stolen.
917.96	Period. None. Zero.
919.56	So we want to make it
919.56	very much like a white Volvo.
924.36	Each government has a task force.
926.6	This perhaps is less interesting,
928.24	but we're trying to get the governments
928.24	to all work together
931.169	and it's not easy.
934.88	The economics of this
934.88	is to start with the federal governments
939.951	and then later,
939.951	to subsequently go to other --
946.957	whether it's child-to-child funding,
948.877	so a child in this country buys one
948.877	for a child in the developing world,
953.36	maybe of the same gender,
953.36	maybe of the same age.
956.48	An uncle gives a niece or a nephew that
956.48	as a birthday present.
960.2	I mean, there are all sorts of things
960.2	that will happen,
962.92	and they'll be very, very exciting.
964.84	And everybody says -- I say --
964.84	it's an education project.
969.859	Are we providing the software?
971.88	The answer is:
973.389	The system certainly has software,
975.04	but no, we're not providing
975.04	the education content.
978.2	That is really done in the countries.
982.32	But we are certainly constructionists.
984.42	And we certainly believe
984.42	in learning by doing
986.6	and everything from Logo,
986.6	which was started in 1968,
990.76	to more modern things, like Scratch,
990.76	if you've ever even heard of it,
995.76	are very, very much part of it.
997.84	And that's the rollout.
1000.88	Are we dreaming? Is this real?
1003.143	It actually is real.
1005.76	The only criticism, and people
1005.76	really don't want to criticize this,
1010.52	because it is a humanitarian effort,
1010.52	a nonprofit effort
1014.4	and to criticize it
1014.4	is a little bit stupid, actually.
1018.24	(Laughter)
1019.48	But the one thing
1019.48	that people could criticize was,
1025.64	"""Great idea, but these guys can't do it."""
1029.8	And that could either mean these guys,
1029.8	professors and so on couldn't do it,
1034	or that it's not possible.
1036	Well, on December 12, a company
1036	called Quanta agreed to build it,
1041.72	and since they make about one-third
1041.72	of all the laptops on the planet today,
1046.68	that question disappeared.
1048.28	So it's not a matter
1048.28	of whether it's going to happen.
1051.52	It is going to happen.
1052.76	And if it comes out
1052.76	at 138 dollars, so what?
1057.204	If it comes out six months late, so what?
1060.23	That's a pretty soft landing.
1061.93	Thank you.
1063.49	(Applause)
