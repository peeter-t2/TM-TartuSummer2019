12.826	I want to talk to you about my kids.
15.743	Now, I know everyone thinks
15.743	that their kid is the most fantastic,
20.415	the most beautiful kid that ever lived.
23.352	But mine really are.
24.625	(Laughter)
25.956	I have 696 kids,
28.354	and they are the most intelligent,
28.354	inventive, innovative,
32.83	brilliant and powerful kids
32.83	that you'll ever meet.
37.263	Any student I've had the honor of teaching
37.263	in my classroom is my kid.
42.702	"However, because their ""real"""
42.702	parents aren't rich
46.545	and, I argue, because they
46.545	are mostly of color,
49.445	they will seldom get to see in themselves
51.975	the awesomeness that I see in them.
54.839	Because what I see in them is myself --
57.896	or what would have been myself.
61.645	I am the daughter of two hardworking,
64.062	college-educated, African-American parents
66.704	who chose careers as public servants:
69.442	my father, a minister;
69.442	my mother, an educator.
73.078	Wealth was never the primary
73.078	ambition in our house.
76.981	Because of this lack of wealth,
78.761	we lived in a neighborhood
78.761	that lacked wealth,
80.995	and henceforth a school system
80.995	that lacked wealth.
84.307	Luckily, however, we struck
84.307	the educational jackpot
88.171	in a voluntary desegregation program
90.566	that buses inner-city kids --
90.566	black and brown --
93.958	out to suburban schools -- rich and white.
97.288	At five years old, I had to take
97.288	an hour-long bus ride
101.073	to a faraway place
103.158	to get a better education.
105.522	At five years old, I thought
105.522	everyone had a life just like mine.
110.621	I thought everyone went to school
112.675	and were the only ones
112.675	using the brown crayons
115.058	to color in their family portraits,
116.75	while everyone else was using
116.75	the peach-colored ones.
120.559	At five years old, I thought
120.559	everyone was just like me.
124.792	But as I got older, I started
124.792	noticing things, like:
128.948	How come my neighborhood friend
128.948	don't have to wake up
131.534	at five o'clock in the morning,
133.096	and go to a school that's an hour away?
136.278	How come I'm learning to play the violin
138.552	while my neighborhood friends
138.552	don't even have a music class?
143.04	Why were my neighborhood friends
143.04	learning and reading material
146.608	that I had done two to three years prior?
149.882	See, as I got older,
152.762	I started to have
152.762	this unlawful feeling in my belly,
156.715	like I was doing something
156.715	that I wasn't supposed to be doing;
160.647	taking something that wasn't mine;
163.819	receiving a gift,
165.544	but with someone else's name on it.
167.929	All these amazing things
167.929	that I was being exposed to
171.457	and experiencing,
173.179	I felt I wasn't really supposed to have.
177.189	I wasn't supposed to have a library,
177.189	fully equipped athletic facilities,
181.24	or safe fields to play in.
184.208	I wasn't supposed to have
184.208	theatre departments
186.479	with seasonal plays and concerts --
188.868	digital, visual, performing arts.
191.603	I wasn't supposed to have
191.603	fully resourced biology or chemistry labs,
196.283	school buses that brought me door-to-door,
199.109	freshly prepared school lunches
201.561	or even air conditioning.
204.127	These are things my kids don't get.
206.661	You see, as I got older,
208.222	while I was grateful
208.222	for this amazing opportunity
211.263	that I was being given,
212.933	there was this ever-present pang of:
216.21	But what about everyone else?
219.137	There are thousands
219.137	of other kids just like me,
222.531	who deserve this, too.
224.291	Why doesn't everyone get this?
226.453	Why is a high-quality education
226.453	only exclusive to the rich?
231.634	It was like I had some sort
231.634	of survivor's remorse.
235.222	All of my neighborhood friends
235.222	were experiencing
237.978	an educational train wreck
239.827	that I was saved from through a bus ride.
244.067	I was like an educational Moses screaming,
246.585	"""Let my people go ..."
248.218	"to high-quality schools!"""
250.079	(Laughter)
251.52	I'd seen firsthand how the other half
251.52	was being treated and educated.
256.104	I'd seen the educational promised land,
259.067	and I could not for the life of me
259.067	justify the disparity.
265.55	I now teach in the very same school system
265.55	from which I sought refuge.
270.87	I know firsthand the tools
270.87	that were given to me as a student,
275.431	and now as a teacher, I don't have
275.431	access to those same tools
279.378	to give my students.
281.451	There have been countless nights
281.451	when I've cried in frustration,
286.05	anger
287.35	and sorrow,
288.765	because I can't teach my kids
288.765	the way that I was taught,
292.581	because I don't have access
292.581	to the same resources or tools
296.796	that were used to teach me.
299.393	My kids deserve so much better.
302.27	We sit and we keep banging
302.27	our heads against this term:
305.157	"""Achievement gap, achievement gap!"""
308.462	Is it really that hard to understand
311.418	why these kids perform well
311.418	and these kids don't?
314.667	I mean, really.
316.664	I think we've got it all wrong.
318.955	I think we,
320.14	as Gloria Ladson-Billings says,
322.246	should flip our paradigm and our language
322.246	and call it what it really is.
327.516	It's not an achievement gap;
329.878	it's an education debt,
332.417	for all of the foregone schooling
332.417	resources that were never invested
337.719	in the education of the black
337.719	and brown child over time.
342.82	A little-known secret in American history
345.87	is that the only American institution
345.87	created specifically for people of color
351.714	is the American slave trade --
353.866	and some would argue the prison system,
355.839	but that's another topic
355.839	for another TED Talk.
358.089	(Laughter)
359.654	The public school system of this country
359.654	was built, bought and paid for
363.971	using commerce generated
363.971	from the slave trade and slave labor.
368.651	While African-Americans were enslaved
368.651	and prohibited from schooling,
372.638	their labor established
372.638	the very institution
375.821	from which they were excluded.
378.042	Ever since then, every court case,
378.042	educational policy, reform,
383.145	has been an attempt
383.145	to retrofit the design,
386.423	rather than just stopping
386.423	and acknowledging:
389.107	we've had it all wrong from the beginning.
393.243	An oversimplification
393.243	of American educational history.
397.31	All right, just bear with me.
399.681	Blacks were kept out -- you know,
399.681	the whole slavery thing.
403.256	With the help
403.256	of philanthropic white people,
405.357	they built their own schools.
406.935	Separate but equal was OK.
409.729	But while we all know
409.729	things were indeed separate,
412.483	they were in no ways equal.
414.571	Enter Brown v. the Board of Education
414.571	of Topeka, Kansas in 1954;
419.76	legal separation of the races
419.76	is now illegal.
423.9	But very few people pay attention
423.9	to all of the court cases since then,
430.153	that have undone the educational
430.153	promised land for every child
435.45	that Brown v. Board intended.
438.438	Some argue that today our schools
438.438	are now more segregated
442.18	than they ever were before we tried
442.18	to desegregate them in the first place.
447.963	Teaching my kids about desegregation,
447.963	the Little Rock Nine,
451.58	the Civil Rights Movement,
452.907	is a real awkward moment in my classroom,
456.261	when I have to hear
456.261	the voice of a child ask,
459.94	"""If schools were desegregated in 1954,"
463.267	"how come there are no white kids here?"""
465.588	(Laughter)
467.072	These kids aren't dumb.
469.292	They know exactly what's happening,
471.542	and what's not.
473.526	They know that when it comes to schooling,
476.67	black lives don't matter
479.081	and they never have.
482.316	For years, I tried desperately
482.316	to cultivate in my kids a love of reading.
489.416	I'd amassed a modest classroom library
492.304	of books I'd accumulated
492.304	from secondhand shops,
495.625	thrift stores, attics -- you know.
498.112	But whenever I said those dreadful words,
500.596	"""Take out a book and read,"""
502.816	you'd think I'd just declared war.
505.273	It was torture.
507.693	One day,
509.184	after I'd heard about this website
509.184	called DonorsChoose,
512.338	where classroom teachers create wish lists
514.678	of items they need for their classroom
516.806	and anonymous donors fulfill them,
519.357	I figured I'd go out on a limb
519.357	and just make a wish list
523.382	of the teenager's dream library.
527.698	Over 200 brand-new books
527.698	were sent to my room piece by piece.
532.672	Every day there were new deliveries
532.672	and my kids would exclaim with glee,
537.269	"""This feels like Christmas!"""
539.25	(Laughter)
540.354	Then they'd say,
541.543	"""Ms. Sumner, where did"
541.543	"these books come from?"""
544.439	And then I'd reply,
545.679	"""Strangers from all over the country"
545.679	"wanted you to have these."""
550.274	And then they'd say, almost suspiciously,
554.474	"""But they're brand-new."""
556.225	(Laughter)
557.251	To which I'd reply,
558.854	"""You deserve brand-new books."""
562.137	The whole experience hit home
562.137	for me when one of my girls,
565.584	as she peeled open a crisp paperback said,
569.582	"""Ms. Sumner -- you know,"
569.582	I figured you bought these books,
573.984	'cause you teachers
573.984	are always buying us stuff.
577.158	But to know that a stranger,
577.158	someone I don't even know,
581.211	cares this much about me
583.48	"is pretty cool."""
585.87	Knowing that strangers
585.87	will take care of you
588.519	is a privilege my kids aren't afforded.
592.342	Ever since the donation,
593.808	there has been a steady stream of kids
593.808	signing out books to take home,
597.69	and then returning them
597.69	with the exclamation,
600.374	"""This one was good!"""
601.986	(Laughter)
603.058	Now when I say,
603.058	"""Take out a book and read,"""
605.384	kids rush to my library.
608.849	It wasn't that they didn't want to read,
610.92	but instead, they'd gladly read
610.92	if the resources were there.
617.579	Institutionally speaking,
619.255	our public school system has never
619.255	done right by the black and brown child.
624.068	We keep focusing on the end results
626.64	or test results,
628.029	and getting frustrated.
629.899	We get to a catastrophe and we wonder,
632.06	"""How did it get so bad?"
632.06	"How did we get here?"""
635.89	Really?
637.439	If you neglect a child long enough,
639.538	you no longer have
639.538	the right to be surprised
642.652	when things don't turn out well.
645.319	Stop being perplexed
647.077	or confused
648.727	or befuddled
650.68	by the achievement gap,
652.63	the income gap,
653.877	the incarceration rates,
655.52	or whatever socioeconomic disparity
655.52	"is the new ""it"" term for the moment."
661.248	The problems we have as a country
663.714	are the problems we created as a country.
666.74	The quality of your education
666.74	is directly proportionate
670.302	to your access to college,
672.184	your access to jobs,
673.936	your access to the future.
677.594	Until we live in a world where every kid
677.594	can get a high-quality education
682.888	no matter where they live,
684.448	or the color of their skin,
686.352	there are things we can do
686.352	on a macro level.
691.389	School funding should not
691.389	be decided by property taxes
694.977	or some funky economic equation
697.232	where rich kids continue
697.232	to benefit from state aid,
700.292	while poor kids are continuously
700.292	having food and resources
704.401	taken from their mouths.
706.75	Governors, senators, mayors,
706.75	city council members --
710.535	if we're going to call
710.535	public education public education,
713.423	then it should be just that.
715.555	Otherwise, we should
715.555	call it what it really is:
718.562	poverty insurance.
721.211	"""Public education:"
722.677	"keeping poor kids poor since 1954."""
725.789	(Laughter)
728.733	If we really, as a country, believe
728.733	"that education is the ""great equalizer,"""
733.855	then it should be just that:
733.855	equal and equitable.
738.158	Until then, there's no democracy
738.158	in our democratic education.
743.493	On a mezzo level:
745.64	historically speaking, the education
745.64	of the black and brown child
748.866	has always depended
748.866	on the philanthropy of others.
752.361	And unfortunately, today it still does.
755.77	If your son or daughter or niece
755.77	or nephew or neighbor
760.159	or little Timmy down the street
762.253	goes to an affluent school,
764.58	challenge your school committee
764.58	to adopt an impoverished school
767.778	or an impoverished classroom.
769.841	Close the divide by engaging
769.841	in communication
773.262	and relationships that matter.
776.05	When resources are shared,
778.028	they're not divided;
779.744	they're multiplied.
781.871	And on a micro level:
783.734	if you're a human being,
785.985	donate.
787.524	Time, money, resources, opportunities --
791.611	whatever is in your heart.
794.847	There are websites like DonorsChoose
797.075	that recognize the disparity
799.153	and actually want
799.153	to do something about it.
803.748	What is a carpenter with no tools?
806.35	What is an actress with no stage?
808.99	What is a scientist with no laboratory?
811.859	What is a doctor with no equipment?
815.27	I'll tell you:
816.97	they're my kids.
819.219	Shouldn't they be your kids, too?
821.893	Thank you.
823.068	(Applause)
