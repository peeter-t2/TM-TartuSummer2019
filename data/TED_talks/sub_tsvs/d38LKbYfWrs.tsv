12.719	I'd like to talk today
14.209	about a powerful and fundamental aspect
17.136	of who we are: our voice.
20.734	Each one of us has a unique voiceprint
23.48	that reflects our age, our size,
25.769	even our lifestyle and personality.
29.006	In the words of the poet Longfellow,
31.148	"""the human voice is the organ of the soul."""
35.018	As a speech scientist, I'm fascinated
37.765	by how the voice is produced,
39.594	and I have an idea for how it can be engineered.
43.252	That's what I'd like to share with you.
45.462	I'm going to start by playing you a sample
47.276	of a voice that you may recognize.
49.147	"(Recording) Stephen Hawking: ""I would have thought"
50.451	"it was fairly obvious what I meant."""
53.2	Rupal Patel: That was the voice
54.48	of Professor Stephen Hawking.
56.566	What you may not know is that same voice
60.415	may also be used by this little girl
62.893	who is unable to speak
64.59	because of a neurological condition.
67.187	In fact, all of these individuals
69.255	may be using the same voice,
71.267	and that's because there's
71.267	only a few options available.
74.824	In the U.S. alone, there are 2.5 million Americans
79.141	who are unable to speak,
80.751	and many of whom use computerized devices
83.373	to communicate.
84.895	Now that's millions of people worldwide
88.374	who are using generic voices,
90.026	including Professor Hawking,
91.472	who uses an American-accented voice.
96.305	This lack of individuation of the synthetic voice
99.633	really hit home
101.049	when I was at an assistive technology conference
103.521	a few years ago,
105.371	and I recall walking into an exhibit hall
108.975	and seeing a little girl and a grown man
112.019	having a conversation using their devices,
114.935	different devices, but the same voice.
119.219	And I looked around and I saw this happening
121.128	all around me, literally hundreds of individuals
125.318	using a handful of voices,
128.056	voices that didn't fit their bodies
131.147	or their personalities.
133.229	We wouldn't dream of fitting a little girl
135.956	with the prosthetic limb of a grown man.
139.352	So why then the same prosthetic voice?
142.656	It really struck me,
143.947	and I wanted to do something about this.
147.098	I'm going to play you now a sample
149.051	of someone who has, two people actually,
152.339	who have severe speech disorders.
154.107	I want you to take a listen to how they sound.
157.337	They're saying the same utterance.
159.694	(First voice)
162.126	(Second voice)
165.743	You probably didn't understand what they said,
168.155	but I hope that you heard
170.009	their unique vocal identities.
174.292	So what I wanted to do next is,
177.105	I wanted to find out how we could harness
179.489	these residual vocal abilities
181.31	and build a technology
183.326	that could be customized for them,
185.469	voices that could be customized for them.
187.898	So I reached out to my collaborator, Tim Bunnell.
190.583	Dr. Bunnell is an expert in speech synthesis,
193.646	and what he'd been doing is building
195.679	personalized voices for people
197.56	by putting together
199.657	pre-recorded samples of their voice
201.807	and reconstructing a voice for them.
204.686	These are people who had lost their voice
206.398	later in life.
208.309	We didn't have the luxury
209.703	of pre-recorded samples of speech
211.477	for those born with speech disorder.
213.769	But I thought, there had to be a way
216.306	to reverse engineer a voice
218.25	from whatever little is left over.
220.541	So we decided to do exactly that.
223.255	We set out with a little bit of funding
223.255	from the National Science Foundation,
226.658	to create custom-crafted voices that captured
230.223	their unique vocal identities.
231.759	We call this project VocaliD, or vocal I.D.,
234.962	for vocal identity.
236.995	Now before I get into the details of how
239.669	the voice is made and let you listen to it,
241.717	I need to give you a real quick
241.717	speech science lesson. Okay?
245.067	So first, we know that the voice is changing
248.226	dramatically over the course of development.
251.08	Children sound different from teens
253.17	who sound different from adults.
254.633	We've all experienced this.
257.275	Fact number two is that speech
260.638	is a combination of the source,
263.191	which is the vibrations generated by your voice box,
266.67	which are then pushed through
268.609	the rest of the vocal tract.
271.046	These are the chambers of your head and neck
273.53	that vibrate,
274.769	and they actually filter that source sound
276.879	to produce consonants and vowels.
279.416	So the combination of source and filter
283.276	is how we produce speech.
285.906	And that happens in one individual.
288.932	Now I told you earlier that I'd spent
291.558	a good part of my career
293.583	understanding and studying
296.036	the source characteristics of people
297.994	with severe speech disorder,
300.295	and what I've found
301.76	is that even though their filters were impaired,
305.126	they were able to modulate their source:
308.087	the pitch, the loudness, the tempo of their voice.
311.349	These are called prosody, and
311.349	I've been documenting for years
314.717	that the prosodic abilities of these individuals
316.994	are preserved.
318.569	So when I realized that those same cues
322.656	are also important for speaker identity,
325.425	I had this idea.
327.44	Why don't we take the source
329.956	from the person we want the voice to sound like,
332.169	because it's preserved,
333.632	and borrow the filter
335.767	from someone about the same age and size,
339.011	because they can articulate speech,
341.418	and then mix them?
343.209	Because when we mix them,
344.996	we can get a voice that's as clear
346.694	as our surrogate talker --
348.448	that's the person we borrowed the filter from—
351.043	and is similar in identity to our target talker.
355.692	It's that simple.
357.119	That's the science behind what we're doing.
360.053	So once you have that in mind,
363.586	how do you go about building this voice?
365.844	Well, you have to find someone
367.324	who is willing to be a surrogate.
369.724	It's not such an ominous thing.
371.988	Being a surrogate donor
373.511	only requires you to say a few hundred
376.299	to a few thousand utterances.
378.541	The process goes something like this.
380.544	(Video) Voice: Things happen in pairs.
382.734	I love to sleep.
384.659	The sky is blue without clouds.
388.541	RP: Now she's going to go on like this
390.543	for about three to four hours,
392.462	and the idea is not for her to say everything
395.467	that the target is going to want to say,
397.512	but the idea is to cover all the different combinations
400.907	of the sounds that occur in the language.
404.178	The more speech you have,
405.816	the better sounding voice you're going to have.
408.121	Once you have those recordings,
409.794	what we need to do
411.207	is we have to parse these recordings
413.925	into little snippets of speech,
416.374	one- or two-sound combinations,
418.711	sometimes even whole words
420.594	that start populating a dataset or a database.
425.11	We're going to call this database a voice bank.
428.827	Now the power of the voice bank
430.923	is that from this voice bank,
432.937	we can now say any new utterance,
434.948	"like, ""I love chocolate"" --"
436.372	everyone needs to be able to say that—
438.111	fish through that database
439.942	and find all the segments necessary
441.882	to say that utterance.
443.811	(Video) Voice: I love chocolate.
445.6	RP: So that's speech synthesis.
446.991	It's called concatenative synthesis,
446.991	and that's what we're using.
449.564	That's not the novel part.
451.097	What's novel is how we make it sound
453.318	like this young woman.
454.775	This is Samantha.
456.299	I met her when she was nine,
458.645	and since then, my team and I
460.542	have been trying to build her a personalized voice.
463.256	We first had to find a surrogate donor,
466.355	and then we had to have Samantha
468.173	produce some utterances.
470.102	What she can produce are mostly vowel-like sounds,
472.481	but that's enough for us to extract
474.96	her source characteristics.
477.245	What happens next is best described
480.516	by my daughter's analogy. She's six.
483.283	She calls it mixing colors to paint voices.
488.705	It's beautiful. It's exactly that.
491.26	Samantha's voice is like a concentrated sample
494.12	of red food dye which we can infuse
496.729	into the recordings of her surrogate
499.269	to get a pink voice just like this.
503.656	(Video) Samantha: Aaaaaah.
508.147	RP: So now, Samantha can say this.
510.955	(Video) Samantha: This voice is only for me.
514.024	I can't wait to use my new voice with my friends.
520.329	RP: Thank you. (Applause)
526.746	I'll never forget the gentle smile
529.079	that spread across her face
530.981	when she heard that voice for the first time.
534.63	Now there's millions of people
536.512	around the world like Samantha, millions,
539.345	and we've only begun to scratch the surface.
542.785	What we've done so far is we have
544.427	a few surrogate talkers from around the U.S.
548.286	who have donated their voices,
549.793	and we have been using those
551.721	to build our first few personalized voices.
556.193	But there's so much more work to be done.
557.949	For Samantha, her surrogate
560.137	came from somewhere in the Midwest, a stranger
563.183	who gave her the gift of voice.
567.024	And as a scientist, I'm so excited
569.177	to take this work out of the laboratory
571.112	and finally into the real world
572.912	so it can have real-world impact.
576.077	What I want to share with you next
577.659	is how I envision taking this work
579.834	to that next level.
582.545	I imagine a whole world of surrogate donors
586.432	from all walks of life, different sizes, different ages,
589.692	coming together in this voice drive
592.75	to give people voices
595.02	that are as colorful as their personalities.
598.819	To do that as a first step,
601.119	we've put together this website, VocaliD.org,
604.394	as a way to bring together those
606.018	who want to join us as voice donors,
608.693	as expertise donors,
610.465	in whatever way to make this vision a reality.
615.804	They say that giving blood can save lives.
619.957	Well, giving your voice can change lives.
624.939	All we need is a few hours of speech
627.989	from our surrogate talker,
629.48	and as little as a vowel from our target talker,
634.213	to create a unique vocal identity.
637.924	So that's the science behind what we're doing.
640.55	I want to end by circling back to the human side
645.005	that is really the inspiration for this work.
649.107	About five years ago, we built our very first voice
652.806	for a little boy named William.
655.307	When his mom first heard this voice,
657.664	"she said, ""This is what William"
660.009	would have sounded like
661.555	"had he been able to speak."""
664.004	And then I saw William typing a message
666.422	on his device.
667.784	I wondered, what was he thinking?
671.077	Imagine carrying around someone else's voice
674.667	for nine years
676.86	and finally finding your own voice.
681.704	Imagine that.
683.081	This is what William said:
685.878	"""Never heard me before."""
692.417	Thank you.
694.036	(Applause)
