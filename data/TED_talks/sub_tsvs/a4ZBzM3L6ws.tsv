13.081	According to the UN,
15.111	billions of people still live
15.111	without an address.
19.154	The economist Hernando de Soto said,
21.459	"""Without an address,"
22.841	you live outside the law.
24.767	"You might as well not exist."""
27.679	I'm here to tell you how my team and I
27.679	are trying to change that.
31.986	If you go to an online map
31.986	and look at a favela in Brazil
35.226	or a township in South Africa,
37.074	you'll see a few streets
37.074	but a lot of empty space.
40.678	But if you flip to satellite view,
42.845	there are thousands of people,
42.845	homes and businesses
45.983	in this vast, unmapped
45.983	and unaddressed spaces.
49.551	In Ghana's capital, Accra,
51.435	there are numbers and letters
51.435	scrawled onto the sides of walls,
55.548	where they piloted address systems
55.548	but not finished them.
60.163	But these places,
60.163	these unaddressed places,
63.323	hold huge economic potential.
67.201	Here's why the issue
67.201	of addressing stuck with me.
70.453	I worked in the music
70.453	business for 10 years,
72.529	and what you may not know
72.529	about the music world
74.931	is that every day, people struggle
74.931	with the problems of addressing.
78.368	So from the musicians
78.368	who have to find the gigs
81.221	to the production companies
81.221	who bring the equipment,
83.674	everyone somehow always gets lost.
85.76	We even had to add someone
85.76	to our schedules
87.925	who was the person you called
87.925	when you thought you'd arrived
90.768	but then realized you hadn't.
92.176	And we had some pretty bad days,
94.523	like in Italy, where a truck driver
94.523	unloaded all the equipment
97.732	an hour north of Rome,
97.732	not an hour south of Rome,
100.339	and a slightly worse day
101.572	where a keyboard player
101.572	called me and said,
103.671	"""Chris, don't panic,"
103.671	but we may have just sound-checked
106.609	"at the wrong people's wedding."""
108.196	(Laughter)
109.795	So not long after the fated Rome event,
112.457	I chatted this through
112.457	with a friend of mine
114.59	who is a mathematician,
115.778	and we thought it was a problem
115.778	we could do something about.
118.612	We thought, well,
118.612	we could make a new system,
120.973	but it shouldn't look like the old system.
123.628	We agreed that addresses were bad.
126.474	We knew we wanted something very precise,
128.524	but GPS coordinates,
128.524	latitude and longitude,
130.903	were just too complicated.
133.256	So we divided the world
133.256	into three-meter squares.
136.583	The world divides into around 57 trillion
136.583	three-meter squares,
140.7	and we found that there are
140.7	enough combinations
142.915	of three dictionary words
144.749	that we could name every three-meter
144.749	square in the world uniquely
148.365	with just three words.
150.546	We used 40,000 words,
152.141	so that's 40,000 cubed,
157.015	which is more than enough for
157.015	the 57-trillion-odd three-meter squares,
160.927	with a few spare.
163.044	So that's exactly what we did.
165.017	We divided the world
165.017	into three-meter squares,
168.115	gave each one a unique,
168.115	three-word identifier --
170.98	what we call a three-word address.
173.385	So for example, right here,
176.481	I'm standing at mustards.coupons.pinup,
178.858	(Laughter)
180.032	but over here ...
182.753	I'm standing at pinched.
182.753	singularly.tutorial.
189.133	But we haven't just done this in English.
191.128	We thought it was essential that people
191.128	should be able to use this system
194.581	in their own language.
195.867	So far, we've built it into 14 languages,
198.124	including French, Swahili and Arabic,
200.591	and we're working on more now,
200.591	like Xhosa, Zulu and Hindi.
205.157	But this idea can do a lot more
207.028	than just get my musicians
207.028	to their gigs on time.
209.752	If the 75 percent of countries
209.752	that struggle with reliable addressing
213.953	started using three-word addresses,
215.681	there's a stack of far more
215.681	important applications.
220.033	In Durban, South Africa,
222.487	an NGO called Gateway Health
224.168	have distributed 11,000
224.168	three-word address signs
227.142	to their community,
228.555	so the pregnant mothers,
228.555	when they go into labor,
230.958	can call the emergency services
232.79	and tell them exactly
232.79	where to pick them up from,
235.165	because otherwise, the ambulances
235.165	have often taken hours to find them.
238.964	In Mongolia, the National Post Service
238.964	have adopted the system
242.265	and are now doing deliveries
242.265	to many people's houses
244.727	for the first time.
246.152	The UN are using it
246.152	to geotag photos in disaster zones
249.859	so they can deliver aid
249.859	to exactly the right place.
252.555	Even Domino's Pizza
252.555	are using it in the Caribbean,
255.249	because they haven't been able
255.249	to find customers' homes,
257.974	but they really want to get
257.974	their pizza to them while its still hot.
261.729	Shortly, you'll be able to get into a car,
264.274	speak the three words,
266.034	and the car will navigate you
266.034	to that exact spot.
269.888	In Africa, the continent
269.888	has leapfrogged phone lines
273.437	to go to mobile phones,
274.854	bypassed traditional banks
274.854	to go straight to mobile payments.
279.298	We're really proud that the post services
279.298	of three African countries --
283.276	Nigeria, Djibouti and CÃ´te d'Ivoire,
285.896	have gone straight to adopting
285.896	three-word addresses,
288.572	which means that people in those countries
290.669	have a really simple way
290.669	to explain where they live, today.
295.167	For me, poor addressing
295.167	was an annoying frustration,
298.87	but for billions of people,
301.398	it's a huge business inefficiency,
303.835	severely hampers
303.835	their infrastructure growth,
306.54	and can cost lives.
308.837	We're on a mission to change that,
310.489	three words at a time.
311.726	Thank you.
312.901	(Applause)
