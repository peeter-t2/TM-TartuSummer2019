12.694	What's the scariest thing you've ever done?
17.547	Or another way to say it is,
20.597	what's the most dangerous 
20.597	thing that you've ever done?
24.071	And why did you do it?
28.254	I know what the most dangerous thing is
29.872	that I've ever done
31.065	because NASA does the math.
33.349	You look back to the first five shuttle launches,
35.701	the odds of a catastrophic event
38.289	during the first five shuttle launches
39.869	was one in nine.
42.793	And even when I first flew in the shuttle
44.691	back in 1995, 74 shuttle flight,
47.379	the odds were still now that we look back
49.369	about one in 38 or so -- one in 35, one in 40.
55.037	Not great odds, so it's a really interesting day
57.604	when you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center
59.896	and you're going to go to space that day
62.266	because you realize by the end of the day
64.001	you're either going to be floating 
64.001	effortlessly, gloriously in space,
67.631	or you'll be dead.
70.748	You go into, at the Kennedy Space Center,
74.108	the suit-up room,
76.098	the same room that our childhood heroes
80.353	got dressed in,
81.611	that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got suited in
84.586	to go ride the Apollo rocket to the moon.
86.727	And I got my pressure suit built around me
90.194	and rode down outside in the van
94.056	heading out to the launchpad --
95.631	in the Astro van -- heading out to the launchpad,
98.533	and as you come around the corner
100.642	at the Kennedy Space Center,
102.647	it's normally predawn, and in the distance,
106.032	lit up by the huge xenon lights,
109.034	is your spaceship --
112.449	the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet.
116.289	The crew is sitting in the Astro van
118.893	sort of hushed, almost holding hands,
121.008	looking at that as it gets bigger and bigger.
123.557	We ride the elevator up
126	and we crawl in, on your hands and knees
128.355	into the spaceship, one at a time,
130.003	and you worm your way up
131.65	into your chair and plunk yourself down
134.217	on your back.
136.505	And the hatch is closed,
140.453	and suddenly,
142.6	what has been a lifetime of both dreams and denial
147.27	is becoming real,
148.725	something that I dreamed about,
149.798	in fact, that I chose to do when I was nine years old,
152.345	is now suddenly within not too many minutes
155.719	of actually happening.
157.577	In the astronaut business --
160.26	the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle;
162.133	it's the most complicated flying machine ever built.
165.968	And in the astronaut business, 
165.968	we have a saying, which is,
169.305	there is no problem so bad
171.273	that you can't make it worse.
173.593	(Laughter)
174.831	And so you're very conscious in the cockpit;
177.933	you're thinking about all of the things
179.371	that you might have to do,
180.562	all the switches and all the 
180.562	wickets you have to go through.
182.873	And as the time gets closer and closer,
185.066	this excitement is building.
186.735	And then about three and a 
186.735	half minutes before launch,
188.895	the huge nozzles on the back,
190.702	like the size of big church bells,
192.386	swing back and forth
193.515	and the mass of them is such
194.86	that it sways the whole vehicle,
196.557	like the vehicle is alive underneath you,
199.441	like an elephant getting up 
199.441	off its knees or something.
203.095	And then about 30 seconds before launch,
205.391	the vehicle is completely alive --
207.223	it is ready to go --
208.43	the APUs are running,
209.591	the computers are all self-contained,
211.46	it's ready to leave the planet.
212.949	And 15 seconds before launch, this happens:
216.237	(Video) Voice: 12, 11, 10,
220.675	nine, eight, seven, six --
224.703	(Space shuttle preparing for takeoff)
227.251	-- start, two, one,
230.143	booster ignition, and liftoff of 
230.143	the space shuttle Discovery,
234.286	returning to the space station, paving the way ...
238.317	(Space shuttle taking off)
250.901	Chris Hadfield: It is incredibly powerful
253.161	to be on board one of these things.
254.964	You are in the grip of something
256.995	that is vastly more powerful than yourself.
259.192	It's shaking you so hard you can't focus
261.815	on the instruments in front of you.
263.262	It's like you're in the jaws of some enormous dog
266.178	and there's a foot in the small of your back
268.924	pushing you into space,
270.451	accelerating wildly straight up,
272.5	shouldering your way through the air,
274.202	and you're in a very complex place --
276.733	paying attention, watching the vehicle
278.538	go through each one of its wickets
280.189	with a steadily increasing smile on your face.
282.61	After two minutes, those solid rockets explode off
285.807	and then you just have the liquid engines,
288.221	the hydrogen and oxygen,
289.674	and it's as if you're in a dragster
291.141	with your foot to the floor
292.916	and accelerating like you've never accelerated.
295.335	You get lighter and lighter,
296.65	the force gets on us heavier and heavier.
299.076	It feels like
300.452	someone's pouring cement on you or something.
302.536	Until finally,
303.82	after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so,
306.488	we are finally at exactly the right altitude,
308.683	exactly the right speed,
310.765	the right direction, the engine shut off,
313.845	and we're weightless.
316.067	And we're alive.
318.969	It's an amazing experience.
320.425	But why would we take that risk?
323.733	Why would you do something that dangerous?
327.453	In my case the answer is fairly straightforward.
329.522	I was inspired as a youngster
332.576	that this was what I wanted to do.
334.167	I watched the first people walk on the moon
336.36	and to me, it was just an obvious thing --
338.591	I want to somehow turn myself into that.
341.593	But the real question is,
342.775	how do you deal with the danger of it
345.39	and the fear that comes from it?
347.546	How do you deal with fear versus danger?
351.244	And having the goal in mind,
351.244	thinking about where it might lead,
354.311	directed me to a life of
356.12	looking at all of the small details to allow
359.465	this to become possible,
361.166	to be able to launch and go 
361.166	help build a space station
364.075	where you are on board a million-pound creation
366.535	that's going around the world at five miles a second,
369.371	eight kilometers a second,
370.746	around the world 16 times a day,
373.255	with experiments on board that are teaching us
377.24	what the substance of the universe is made of
379.232	and running 200 experiments inside.
381.818	But maybe even more importantly,
383.666	allowing us to see the world in a way
387.483	that is impossible through any other means,
390.105	to be able to look down
391.644	and have -- if your jaw could drop, it would --
394.947	the jaw-dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb
398.937	like a self-propelled art gallery of fantastic,
403.7	constantly changing beauty that is the world itself.
407.411	And you see, because of the speed,
408.946	a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes
412.772	for half a year.
415.941	And the most magnificent part of all that
418.392	is to go outside on a spacewalk.
421.191	You are in a one-person spaceship
426.599	that is your spacesuit,
428.067	and you're going through space with the world.
431.831	It's an entirely different perspective,
433.584	you're not looking up at the universe,
434.999	you and the Earth are going 
434.999	through the universe together.
438.481	And you're holding on with one hand,
440.28	looking at the world turn beside you.
442.404	It's roaring silently
446.196	with color and texture as it pours by
448.965	mesmerizingly next to you.
450.941	And if you can tear your eyes away from that
453.627	and you look under your arm
455.089	down at the rest of everything,
457.327	it's unfathomable blackness,
462.724	with a texture you feel like you 
462.724	could stick your hand into.
465.792	and you are holding on with one hand,
468.207	one link to the other seven billion people.
470.632	And I was outside on my first spacewalk
472.77	when my left eye went blind,
476.546	and I didn't know why.
478.216	Suddenly my left eye slammed shut
479.826	in great pain
480.95	and I couldn't figure out why my eye wasn't working.
485.009	I was thinking, what do I do next?
486.365	I thought, well maybe that's why we have two eyes,
488.62	so I kept working.
489.873	But unfortunately, without gravity,
493.212	tears don't fall.
495.142	So you just get a bigger and 
495.142	bigger ball of whatever that is
498.166	mixed with your tears on your eye
500.174	until eventually, the ball becomes so big
502.652	that the surface tension takes it 
502.652	across the bridge of your nose
505.213	like a tiny little waterfall
506.947	"and goes ""goosh"" into your other eye,"
509.023	and now I was completely blind
512.49	outside the spaceship.
515.588	So what's the scariest thing you've ever done?
518.167	(Laughter)
521.869	Maybe it's spiders.
523.349	A lot of people are afraid of spiders.
524.878	I think you should be afraid of spiders --
526.607	spiders are creepy and they've got long, hairy legs,
529.29	and spiders like this one, the brown recluse --
532.717	it's horrible. If a brown recluse bites you,
534.859	you end with one of these 
534.859	horrible, big necrotic things
536.593	on your leg
537.696	and there might be one right now
538.949	sitting on the chair behind you, in fact.
542.027	And how do you know?
543.112	And so a spider lands on you,
544.486	and you go through this great, spasmy attack
546.527	because spiders are scary.
548.255	But then you could say, well 
548.255	is there a brown recluse
550.759	sitting on the chair beside me or not?
552.134	I don't know. Are there brown recluses here?
554.148	So if you actually do the research, you find out that
556.831	in the world there are about 
559.876	and there are about two dozen that are venomous
562.551	out of 50,000.
563.902	And if you're in Canada, because of the cold winters
566.27	here in B.C., there's about 720, 
570.75	and there's one -- one --
572.652	that is venomous,
573.511	and its venom isn't even fatal,
575.217	it's just kind of like a nasty sting.
577.118	And that spider -- not only that,
579.043	but that spider has beautiful markings on it,
582.256	"it's like ""I'm dangerous. I got a big radiation "
582.256	"symbol on my back, it's the black widow."""
586.404	So, if you're even slightly careful
588.662	you can avoid running into the one spider --
591.104	and it lives close the ground,
593.25	you're walking along, you are 
593.25	never going to go through
595.702	a spider web where a black widow bites you.
597.552	Spider webs like this, it doesn't build those,
599.525	it builds them down in the corners.
601.155	And its a black widow because
602.747	the female spider eats the male;
604.086	it doesn't care about you.
605.877	So in fact,
607.342	the next time you walk into a spiderweb,
609.641	you don't need to panic and go 
609.641	with your caveman reaction.
613.516	The danger is entirely different than the fear.
618.105	How do you get around it, though?
620.438	How do you change your behavior?
621.692	Well, next time you see a spiderweb,
623.176	have a good look, make sure 
623.176	it's not a black widow spider,
625.39	and then walk into it.
627.182	And then you see another spiderweb
628.82	and walk into that one.
630.042	It's just a little bit of fluffy stuff. It's not a big deal.
632.288	And the spider that may come out is 
632.288	no more threat to you than a lady bug
635.804	or a butterfly.
638.672	And then I guarantee you if you 
638.672	walk through 100 spiderwebs
641.6	you will have changed
643.188	your fundamental human behavior,
645.743	your caveman reaction,
647.248	and you will now be able to walk 
647.248	in the park in the morning
650.075	and not worry about that spiderweb --
651.864	or into your grandma's attic or whatever,
654.324	into your own basement.
659.409	And you can apply this to anything.
662.92	If you're outside on a spacewalk and you're blinded,
665.735	your natural reaction would be to panic, I think.
668.359	It would make you nervous and worried.
670.419	But we had considered all the venom,
672.907	and we had practiced with a whole 
672.907	variety of different spiderwebs.
675.788	We knew everything there is to know
677.522	about the spacesuit
678.98	and we trained underwater thousands of times.
681.493	And we don't just practice things going right,
683.224	we practice things going wrong all the time,
686.048	so that you are constantly walking 
686.048	through those spiderwebs.
689.312	And not just underwater, but 
689.312	also in virtual reality labs
692.389	with the helmet and the gloves
693.78	so you feel like it's realistic.
695.187	So when you finally actually 
695.187	get outside on a spacewalk,
698.515	it feels much different than it would
700.477	if you just went out first time.
702.315	And even if you're blinded,
704.076	your natural, panicky reaction doesn't happen.
707.722	Instead you kind of look around and go,
709.081	"""Okay, I can't see,"
710.733	but I can hear, I can talk,
713.155	Scott Parazynski is out here with me.
714.884	"He could come over and help me."""
716.315	We actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue,
720.229	so he could float me like a blimp
722.02	and stuff me into the airlock if he had to.
724.195	I could find my own way back.
726.395	It's not nearly as big a deal.
727.765	And actually, if you keep on crying for a while,
729.787	whatever that gunk was that's 
729.787	in your eye starts to dilute
732.182	and you can start to see again,
733.702	and Houston, if you negotiate with them,
735.769	they will let you then keep working.
738.766	We finished everything on the spacewalk
740.825	and when we came back inside,
742.422	Jeff got some cotton batting and took 
742.422	the crusty stuff around my eyes,
746.145	and it turned out it was just the anti-fog,
748.597	sort of a mixture of oil and soap, that got in my eye.
752.044	And now we use Johnson's No More Tears,
755.592	which we probably should've been using
756.907	right from the very beginning. (Laughter)
760.543	But the key to that is
765.489	by looking at the difference
767.044	between perceived danger and actual danger,
769.039	where is the real risk?
770.406	What is the real thing that you should be afraid of?
772.46	Not just a generic fear of bad things happening.
775.228	You can fundamentally change 
775.228	your reaction to things
777.595	so that it allows you to go places
780.532	and see things and do things
782.169	that otherwise would be completely denied to you ...
784.665	where you could see the 
784.665	hardpan south of the Sahara,
788.012	or you can see New York City
789.964	in a way that is almost dreamlike,
792.063	or the unconscious gingham 
792.063	of Eastern Europe fields
796.586	or the Great Lakes
798.717	as a collection of small puddles.
801.473	You can see the fault lines of San Francisco
804.703	and the way the water pours out under the bridge,
806.601	just entirely different
808.333	than any other way that you could have
810.002	if you had not found a way to conquer your fear.
813.285	You see a beauty that otherwise
815.724	never would have happened.
819.694	It's time to come home at the end.
821.448	This is our spaceship,
822.767	the Soyuz, that little one.
823.874	Three of us climb in,
825.339	and then this spaceship detaches from the station
827.791	and falls into the atmosphere.
829.461	These two parts here
831.083	actually melt, we jettison them and they burn up
833.247	in the atmosphere.
834.329	The only part that survives is the little bullet
836.582	that we're riding in,
837.758	and it falls into the atmosphere,
839.796	and in essence
841.372	you are riding a meteorite home,
844.933	and riding meteorites is scary,
847.866	and it ought to be.
849.379	But instead of riding into the atmosphere
851.618	just screaming, like you would
852.856	if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite
855.201	back to Earth -- (Laughter) --
858.131	instead, 20 years previously
860.555	we had started studying Russian,
863.171	and then once you learn Russian, then we
865.751	learned orbital mechanics in Russian,
868.265	and then we learned vehicle control theory,
871.235	and then we got into the simulator
872.704	and practiced over and over and over again.
875.276	And in fact, you can fly this meteorite
877.286	and steer it and land in about a 15-kilometer circle
879.495	anywhere on the Earth.
880.919	So in fact, when our crew was coming back
883.844	into the atmosphere inside the Soyuz,
886.404	we weren't screaming, we were laughing;
888.78	it was fun.
889.848	And when the great big parachute opened,
891.776	we knew that if it didn't open
892.995	there's a second parachute,
894.21	and it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism.
896.391	So we came back, we came thundering back
898.773	to Earth and this is what it looked like
900.659	to land in a Soyuz, in Kazakhstan.
903.259	(Video) Reporter: And you can see one of those
905.282	search and recovery helicopters, once again
907.998	that helicopter part of dozen such Russian
911.009	Mi-8 helicopters.
915.637	Touchdown -- 3:14 and 48 seconds,
919.546	a.m. Central Time.
921.021	CH: And you roll to a stop
922.192	as if someone threw your 
922.192	spaceship at the ground
923.861	and it tumbles end over end,
925.243	but you're ready for it
926.249	you're in a custom-built seat,
927.625	you know how the shock absorber works.
929.062	And then eventually the Russians reach in,
931.053	drag you out,
932.211	plunk you into a chair,
933.911	and you can now look back at
937.354	what was an incredible experience.
940.536	You have taken the dreams of that
942.503	nine-year-old boy,
944.115	which were impossible
945.754	and dauntingly scary,
948.644	dauntingly terrifying,
950.344	and put them into practice,
953.068	and figured out a way to reprogram yourself,
956.301	to change your primal fear
958.429	so that it allowed you to come back
961.328	with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration
965.268	for other people
966.611	that never could have been possible otherwise.
971.12	Just to finish, they asked me to play that guitar.
977.347	I know this song,
979.607	and it's really a tribute to the genius
984.827	of David Bowie himself,
986.86	but it's also, I think,
988.773	a reflection of the fact that we are not machines
