151.124	Robbie Mizzone: Thank you.
153.619	Tommy Mizzone: Thank you very much.
155.346	We're so excited to be here.
155.346	It's such an honor.
157.696	Like he said, we're
157.696	three brothers from New Jersey --
160.283	you know, the bluegrass
160.283	capital of the world.
162.959	(Laughter)
165.182	We discovered bluegrass a few years ago,
167.943	and we fell in love with it.
169.356	We hope you guys will too.
170.723	This next song is an original
170.723	"we wrote called ""Time Lapse,"""
174.762	and it will probably live up to its name.

301.313	TM: Thank you very much.
304.33	RM: I'm just going to take
304.33	a second to introduce the band.
307.116	On guitar is my 15-year-old brother Tommy.
309.404	(Applause)
315.009	On banjo is 10-year-old Jonny.
317.271	(Applause)
321.066	He's also our brother.
323.347	And I'm Robbie, and I'm 14,
323.347	and I play the fiddle.
325.836	(Applause)
331.185	As you can see, we decided
331.185	to make it hard on ourselves,
333.871	and we chose to play three songs
335.42	in three different keys.
336.688	(Tuning)
339.061	Yeah. I'm also going to explain,
339.061	a lot of people want to know
341.99	where we got the name
341.99	"""Sleepy Man Banjo Boys"" from."
344.913	So, it started when Jonny was little,
347.205	and he first started the banjo,
347.205	he would play on his back
350.603	with his eyes closed,
351.86	and we'd say it looked
351.86	like he was sleeping.
354.389	So you can probably piece
354.389	the rest together.
356.508	TM: We can't really figure out the reason.
358.58	It might have been
358.58	that it weighs about a million pounds.
