15.513	I am a cultural omnivore,
17.467	one whose daily commute is made possible
17.467	by attachment to an iPod --
22.127	an iPod that contains Wagner and Mozart,
24.38	pop diva Christina Aguilera,
26.42	country singer Josh Turner,
28.06	gangsta rap artist Kirk Franklin,
30.519	concerti, symphonies and more and more.
32.916	I'm a voracious reader,
34.454	a reader who deals with Ian McEwan
34.454	down to Stephanie Meyer.
37.409	I have read the Twilight tetralogy.
40.638	And one who lives for my home theater,
43.08	a home theater where I devour
43.08	DVDs, video on demand
46.083	and a lot of television.
47.497	"For me, ""Law &amp; Order: SVU,"""
47.497	"Tina Fey and ""30 Rock"""
50.902	"and ""Judge Judy"" --"
52.498	"""The people are real, the cases are real,"
52.498	"the rulings are final."""
55.919	(Laughter)
56.955	Now, I'm convinced a lot of you
56.955	probably share my passions,
60.26	"especially my passion for ""Judge Judy,"""
62.571	and you'd fight anybody
62.571	who attempted to take her away from us,
66.085	but I'm a little less convinced that you
66.085	share the central passion of my life,
69.849	a passion for the live
69.849	professional performing arts,
72.586	performing arts that represent
72.586	the orchestral repertoire, yes,
75.592	but jazz as well, modern dance, opera,
78.26	theater and more and more and more.
81.108	Frankly, it's a sector that many of us
81.108	who work in the field
84.26	worry is being endangered
84.26	and possibly dismantled by technology.
88.009	While we initially heralded the Internet
88.009	as the fantastic new marketing device
92.423	that was going to solve all our problems,
94.666	we now realize that the Internet
94.666	is, if anything,
97.087	too effective in that regard.
98.73	Depending on who you read,
98.73	an arts organization
101.26	or an artist, who tries
101.26	to attract the attention
103.75	of a potential single ticket buyer,
105.995	now competes with between three and 5,000
105.995	different marketing messages
111.26	a typical citizen sees every single day.
114.52	We now know, in fact,
116.261	that technology is our biggest
116.261	competitor for leisure time.
119.052	Five years ago,
120.327	Gen Xers spent 20.7 hours online and TV,
120.327	the majority on TV.
125.06	Gen Yers spent even more --
129.886	And now, a typical university-entering
129.886	student arrives at college
135.545	already having spent 20,000 hours online
139.88	and an additional 10,000 hours
139.88	playing video games --
143.716	a stark reminder that we operate
143.716	in a cultural context
146.958	where video games now outsell
146.958	music and movie recordings combined.
153.165	Moreover, we're afraid that technology
155.944	has altered our very assumptions
155.944	of cultural consumption.
159.007	Thanks to the Internet,
160.195	we believe we can get anything
160.195	we want whenever we want it,
163.193	delivered to our own doorstep.
165.036	We can shop at three in the morning
165.036	or eight at night,
167.604	ordering jeans tailor-made
167.604	for our unique body types.
170.561	Expectations of personalization
170.561	and customization
174.511	that the live performing arts --
176.384	which have set curtain times, set venues,
179.26	attendant inconveniences
179.26	of travel, parking and the like --
182.658	simply cannot meet.
184.885	And we're all acutely aware:
186.55	what's it going to mean in the future
188.369	when we ask someone
188.369	to pay a hundred dollars
190.569	for a symphony, opera or ballet ticket,
193.061	when that cultural consumer
193.061	is used to downloading on the internet
	for 99 cents a song or for free?
202.662	These are enormous questions
202.662	for those of us that work in this terrain.
206.725	But as particular as they feel to us,
206.725	we know we're not alone.
210.417	All of us are engaged
211.815	in a seismic, fundamental realignment
211.815	of culture and communications,
216.503	a realignment that is shaking
216.503	and decimating the newspaper industry,
220.291	the magazine industry,
220.291	the book and publishing industry and more.
224.97	Saddled in the performing arts as we are,
224.97	by antiquated union agreements
228.856	that inhibit and often prohibit
228.856	mechanical reproduction and streaming,
233.868	locked into large facilities
233.868	that were designed to ossify
237.736	the ideal relationship
237.736	between artist and audience
241.107	most appropriate to the 19th century
243.416	and locked into a business model
243.416	dependent on high ticket revenues,
246.617	where we charge exorbitant prices.
249.097	Many of us shudder in the wake
249.097	of the collapse of Tower Records
252.526	"and ask ourselves, ""Are we next?"""
256.394	Everyone I talk to in performing arts
256.394	resonates to the words of Adrienne Rich,
261.26	"who, in ""Dreams of a Common"
261.26	"Language,"" wrote,"
263.458	"""We are out in a country"
263.458	that has no language, no laws.
267.17	Whatever we do together is pure invention.
269.732	The maps they gave us
269.732	"are out of date by years."""
275.464	And for those of you who love the arts,
277.393	aren't you glad you invited
277.393	me here to brighten your day?
280.26	(Laughter)
282.26	(Applause)
283.726	Now, rather than saying that we're
283.726	on the brink of our own annihilation,
287.26	I prefer to believe that we are engaged
287.26	in a fundamental reformation,
290.93	a reformation like the religious
290.93	Reformation of the 16th century.
295.166	The arts reformation,
295.166	like the religious Reformation,
298.26	is spurred in part by technology,
299.934	with indeed, the printing press
299.934	really leading the charge
302.695	on the religious Reformation.
304.546	Both reformations were predicated
304.546	on fractious discussion,
307.621	internal self-doubt
309.054	and massive realignment
309.054	of antiquated business models.
313.106	And at heart, both reformations, I think,
313.106	were asking the questions:
316.516	who's entitled to practice?
318.26	How are they entitled to practice?
319.99	And indeed, do we need anyone
319.99	to intermediate for us
324.002	in order to have an experience
324.002	with a spiritual divine?
329.095	Chris Anderson,
329.095	someone I trust you all know,
331.821	editor in chief of Wired magazine
331.821	and author of The Long Tail,
334.857	really was the first, for me,
334.857	to nail a lot of this.
337.985	He wrote a long time ago, you know,
339.68	thanks to the invention of the Internet,
339.68	web technology, minicams and more,
345.229	the means of artistic production
345.229	have been democratized
348.708	for the first time
348.708	in all of human history.
352.483	In the 1930s, if any of you wanted
352.483	to make a movie,
354.96	you had to work for
354.96	Warner Brothers or RKO,
357.26	because who could afford a movie set
359.26	and lighting equipment
359.26	and editing equipment
361.38	and scoring, and more?
363.187	And now who in this room
363.187	doesn't know a 14 year-old
366.39	hard at work on her second,
366.39	third, or fourth movie?
368.945	(Laughter)
370.764	Similarly, the means
370.764	of artistic distribution
373.872	have been democratized
373.872	for the first time in human history.
376.677	Again, in the '30s, Warner Brothers,
376.677	RKO did that for you.
379.652	Now, go to YouTube, Facebook;
381.716	you have worldwide distribution
383.664	without leaving the privacy
383.664	of your own bedroom.
387.214	This double impact is occasioning
389.614	a massive redefinition
389.614	of the cultural market,
392.626	a time when anyone is a potential author.
396.542	Frankly, what we're seeing now
396.542	in this environment
398.913	is a massive time,
398.913	when the entire world is changing
402.037	as we move from a time
402.037	when audience numbers are plummeting.
405.199	But the number of arts participants,
407.637	people who write poetry, who sing songs,
407.637	who perform in church choirs,
411.474	is exploding beyond
411.474	our wildest imaginations.
415.58	This group, others have
415.58	called the pro-ams,
418.097	amateur artists doing work
418.097	at a professional level.
421.018	You see them on YouTube,
421.018	in dance competitions,
423.235	film festivals and more.
424.942	They are radically expanding
426.881	our notions of the potential
426.881	of an aesthetic vocabulary,
430.084	while they are challenging and undermining
432.26	the cultural autonomy
432.26	of our traditional institutions.
435.697	Ultimately, we now live in a world
435.697	defined not by consumption,
439.561	but by participation.
442.557	But I want to be clear,
444.348	just as the religious Reformation
444.348	did not spell the end
447.152	to the formal Church or to the priesthood;
449.189	I believe that our artistic institutions
449.189	will continue to have importance.
453.397	They currently are the best opportunities
455.599	for artists to have lives
455.599	of economic dignity --
457.899	not opulence, of dignity.
460.108	And they are the places where artists
461.914	who deserve and want to work
461.914	at a certain scale of resources
464.758	will find a home.
466.843	But to view them as synonymous
466.843	with the entirety of the arts community
470.996	is, by far, too shortsighted.
473.722	And indeed, while we've tended to polarize
473.722	the amateur from the professional,
477.456	the single most exciting development
477.456	in the last five to 10 years
481.71	has been the rise
481.71	of the professional hybrid artist,
485.537	the professional artist who works,
487.191	not primarily in the concert hall
487.191	or on the stage;
489.936	but most frequently around
489.936	women's rights, or human rights,
493.26	or on global warming issues
493.26	or AIDS relief for more --
496.181	not out of economic necessity,
498.335	but out of a deep, organic conviction
500.913	that the work that she or he
500.913	is called to do
503.429	cannot be accomplished in the traditional
503.429	hermetic arts environment.
507.994	Today's dance world is not defined solely
510.489	by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet
510.489	or the National Ballet of Canada,
513.702	but by Liz Lerman's Dance Exchange --
516.172	a multi-generational,
516.172	professional dance company,
519.26	whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82,
522.892	and who work with genomic scientists
522.892	to embody the DNA strand
526.502	and with nuclear physicists at CERN.
529.438	Today's professional theater community
531.594	is defined, not only the Shaw
531.594	and Stratford Festivals,
534.883	but by the Cornerstone Theater
534.883	of Los Angeles --
537.451	a collective of artists that after 9/11,
540.26	brought together 10 different
540.26	religious communities --
543.771	the Baha'i, the Catholic,
545.583	the Muslim, the Jewish,
547.26	even the Native American
549.012	and the gay and lesbian
549.012	communities of faith,
551.209	helping them create
551.209	their own individual plays
554.26	and one massive play,
556.26	where they explored
556.26	the differences in their faith
558.914	and found commonality
560.26	as an important first step
560.26	toward cross-community healing.
565.098	Today's performers, like Rhodessa Jones,
565.098	work in women's prisons,
568.634	helping women prisoners
568.634	articulate the pain of incarceration,
572.17	while today's playwrights
572.17	and directors work with youth gangs
575.092	to find alternate channels to violence
575.092	and more and more and more.
580.618	And indeed, I think,
580.618	rather than being annihilated,
583.26	the performing arts
583.26	are poised on the brink of a time
585.762	when we will be more important
585.762	than we have ever been.
589.701	You know, we've said for a long time,
591.488	we are critical to the health
591.488	of the economic communities in your town.
594.852	And absolutely --
596.035	I hope you know that every dollar spent
596.035	on a performing arts ticket in a community
600.022	generates five to seven
600.022	additional dollars for the local economy,
603.144	dollars spent in restaurants
603.144	or on parking,
605.186	at the fabric stores
605.186	where we buy fabric for costumes,
607.758	the piano tuner who tunes
607.758	the instruments, and more.
611.045	But the arts are going to be more
611.045	important to economies as we go forward,
614.901	especially in industries
614.901	we can't even imagine yet,
617.426	just as they have been central to the iPod
617.426	and the computer game industries,
621.386	which few, if any of us,
621.386	could have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago.
626.09	Business leadership will depend
626.09	more and more on emotional intelligence,
630.436	the ability to listen deeply,
632.425	to have empathy,
633.932	to articulate change,
633.932	to motivate others --
636.668	the very capacities that the arts
636.668	cultivate with every encounter.
641.408	Especially now,
643.783	as we all must confront
643.783	the fallacy of a market-only orientation,
648.337	uninformed by social conscience;
650.708	we must seize and celebrate
650.708	the power of the arts
653.537	to shape our individual
653.537	and national characters,
656.121	and especially characters
656.121	of the young people,
659.212	who all too often are subjected
659.212	to bombardment of sensation,
662.26	rather than digested experience.
665.506	Ultimately, especially now in this world,
668.522	where we live in a context of regressive
668.522	and onerous immigration laws,
673.167	in reality TV that thrives on humiliation,
676.53	and in a context of analysis,
678.26	where the thing we hear most repeatedly,
678.26	day in, day out in the United States,
682.962	in every train station, every bus station,
682.962	every plane station is,
686.091	"""Ladies and gentlemen,"
687.378	please report any suspicious behavior
687.378	or suspicious individuals
691.432	"to the authorities nearest to you,"""
693.418	when all of these ways we are encouraged
695.38	to view our fellow human being
695.38	with hostility and fear
698.452	and contempt and suspicion.
701.176	The arts, whatever they do,
701.176	whenever they call us together,
704.043	invite us to look at our fellow
704.043	human being with generosity and curiosity.
710.47	God knows, if we ever needed
710.47	that capacity in human history,
714.705	we need it now.
720.374	You know, we're bound together,
722.26	not, I think by technology,
722.26	entertainment and design,
725.711	but by common cause.
727.781	We work to promote
727.781	healthy vibrant societies,
731.088	to ameliorate human suffering,
733.553	to promote a more thoughtful,
733.553	substantive, empathic world order.
740.131	I salute all of you
740.131	as activists in that quest
742.735	and urge you to embrace
742.735	and hold dear the arts in your work,
745.927	whatever your purpose may be.
748.606	I promise you the hand
748.606	of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation
751.549	is stretched out in friendship
751.549	for now and years to come.
754.272	And I thank you for your kindness
754.272	and your patience
756.682	in listening to me this afternoon.
758.364	Thank you, and Godspeed.
