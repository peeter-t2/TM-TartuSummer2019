16.381	So, embryonic stem cells
19.37	are really incredible cells.
22.67	They are our body's own repair kits,
25.458	and they're pluripotent, which means they can morph into
28.422	all of the cells in our bodies.
30.854	Soon, we actually will be able to use stem cells
33.542	to replace cells that are damaged or diseased.
36.527	But that's not what I want to talk to you about,
38.958	because right now there are some really
41.636	extraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells
45.582	that are completely changing
47.189	the way we look and model disease,
50.088	our ability to understand why we get sick,
52.607	and even develop drugs.
55.038	I truly believe that stem cell research is going to allow
59.351	our children to look at Alzheimer's and diabetes
63.856	and other major diseases the way we view polio today,
68.247	which is as a preventable disease.
71.448	So here we have this incredible field, which has
74.671	enormous hope for humanity,
79.058	but much like IVF over 35 years ago,
82.578	until the birth of a healthy baby, Louise,
84.912	this field has been under siege politically and financially.
89.981	Critical research is being challenged instead of supported,
94.253	and we saw that it was really essential to have
98.613	private safe haven laboratories where this work
102.144	could be advanced without interference.
104.974	And so, in 2005,
107.505	we started the New York Stem Cell Foundation Laboratory
110.117	so that we would have a small organization that could
113.706	do this work and support it.
117.018	What we saw very quickly is the world of both medical
120.403	research, but also developing drugs and treatments,
123.779	is dominated by, as you would expect, large organizations,
127.492	but in a new field, sometimes large organizations
130.611	really have trouble getting out of their own way,
132.779	and sometimes they can't ask the right questions,
135.215	and there is an enormous gap that's just gotten larger
138.571	between academic research on the one hand
141.782	and pharmaceutical companies and biotechs
144.483	that are responsible for delivering all of our drugs
147.749	and many of our treatments, and so we knew that
150.139	to really accelerate cures and therapies, we were going
154.085	to have to address this with two things:
156.892	new technologies and also a new research model.
160.114	Because if you don't close that gap, you really are
163.873	exactly where we are today.
165.48	And that's what I want to focus on.
167.147	We've spent the last couple of years pondering this,
170.697	making a list of the different things that we had to do,
173.088	and so we developed a new technology,
175.719	It's software and hardware,
176.97	that actually can generate thousands and thousands of
180.473	genetically diverse stem cell lines to create
183.643	a global array, essentially avatars of ourselves.
187.43	And we did this because we think that it's actually going
190.864	to allow us to realize the potential, the promise,
194.279	of all of the sequencing of the human genome,
197.359	but it's going to allow us, in doing that,
199.863	to actually do clinical trials in a dish with human cells,
204.871	not animal cells, to generate drugs and treatments
209.03	that are much more effective, much safer,
212.279	much faster, and at a much lower cost.
215.535	So let me put that in perspective for you
217.919	and give you some context.
219.335	This is an extremely new field.
224.167	In 1998, human embryonic stem cells
226.999	were first identified, and just nine years later,
230.511	a group of scientists in Japan were able to take skin cells
234.816	and reprogram them with very powerful viruses
238.011	to create a kind of pluripotent stem cell
242.253	called an induced pluripotent stem cell,
244.343	or what we refer to as an IPS cell.
247.351	This was really an extraordinary advance, because
250.549	although these cells are not human embryonic stem cells,
253.093	which still remain the gold standard,
254.887	they are terrific to use for modeling disease
258.357	and potentially for drug discovery.
261.087	So a few months later, in 2008, one of our scientists
264.127	built on that research. He took skin biopsies,
267.327	this time from people who had a disease,
269.355	ALS, or as you call it in the U.K., motor neuron disease.
272.269	He turned them into the IPS cells
273.967	that I've just told you about, and then he turned those
276.653	IPS cells into the motor neurons that actually
279.357	were dying in the disease.
280.818	So basically what he did was to take a healthy cell
283.837	and turn it into a sick cell,
285.551	and he recapitulated the disease over and over again
289.109	in the dish, and this was extraordinary,
292.469	because it was the first time that we had a model
294.717	of a disease from a living patient in living human cells.
298.905	And as he watched the disease unfold, he was able
302.025	to discover that actually the motor neurons were dying
305.036	in the disease in a different way than the field
307.163	had previously thought. There was another kind of cell
309.657	that actually was sending out a toxin
311.858	and contributing to the death of these motor neurons,
314.369	and you simply couldn't see it
315.727	until you had the human model.
317.517	So you could really say that
320.184	researchers trying to understand the cause of disease
324.09	without being able to have human stem cell models
328.242	were much like investigators trying to figure out
331.002	what had gone terribly wrong in a plane crash
334.243	without having a black box, or a flight recorder.
338.24	They could hypothesize about what had gone wrong,
340.842	but they really had no way of knowing what led
343.954	to the terrible events.
346.126	And stem cells really have given us the black box
350.309	for diseases, and it's an unprecedented window.
354.277	It really is extraordinary, because you can recapitulate
357.522	many, many diseases in a dish, you can see
360.769	what begins to go wrong in the cellular conversation
364.305	well before you would ever see
366.729	symptoms appear in a patient.
369.265	And this opens up the ability,
371.788	which hopefully will become something that
374.602	is routine in the near term,
377.249	of using human cells to test for drugs.
381.395	Right now, the way we test for drugs is pretty problematic.
386.859	To bring a successful drug to market, it takes, on average,
392.363	with a sunk cost of 4 billion dollars,
395.751	and only one percent of the drugs that start down that road
400.618	are actually going to get there.
402.866	You can't imagine other businesses
404.991	that you would think of going into
406.44	that have these kind of numbers.
408.195	It's a terrible business model.
409.997	But it is really a worse social model because of
413.986	what's involved and the cost to all of us.
417.314	So the way we develop drugs now
421.066	is by testing promising compounds on --
424.266	We didn't have disease modeling with human cells,
426.146	so we'd been testing them on cells of mice
429.61	or other creatures or cells that we engineer,
433.277	but they don't have the characteristics of the diseases
436.338	that we're actually trying to cure.
438.674	You know, we're not mice, and you can't go into
441.72	a living person with an illness
444.138	and just pull out a few brain cells or cardiac cells
447.066	and then start fooling around in a lab to test
449.355	for, you know, a promising drug.
452.916	But what you can do with human stem cells, now,
456.501	is actually create avatars, and you can create the cells,
460.838	whether it's the live motor neurons
462.805	or the beating cardiac cells or liver cells
465.815	or other kinds of cells, and you can test for drugs,
469.924	promising compounds, on the actual cells
473.049	that you're trying to affect, and this is now,
476.68	and it's absolutely extraordinary,
479.494	and you're going to know at the beginning,
482.65	the very early stages of doing your assay development
486.394	and your testing, you're not going to have to wait 13 years
489.783	until you've brought a drug to market, only to find out
493.102	that actually it doesn't work, or even worse, harms people.
498.158	But it isn't really enough just to look at
502.498	the cells from a few people or a small group of people,
506.28	because we have to step back.
507.924	We've got to look at the big picture.
509.775	Look around this room. We are all different,
512.911	and a disease that I might have,
515.651	if I had Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease,
518.528	it probably would affect me differently than if
522.294	one of you had that disease,
523.935	and if we both had Parkinson's disease,
528.28	and we took the same medication,
530.548	but we had different genetic makeup,
533.295	we probably would have a different result,
535.58	and it could well be that a drug that worked wonderfully
539.311	for me was actually ineffective for you,
542.89	and similarly, it could be that a drug that is harmful for you
547.582	is safe for me, and, you know, this seems totally obvious,
551.884	but unfortunately it is not the way
554.612	that the pharmaceutical industry has been developing drugs
557.798	because, until now, it hasn't had the tools.
561.784	And so we need to move away
564.076	from this one-size-fits-all model.
567.03	The way we've been developing drugs is essentially
570.207	like going into a shoe store,
571.586	no one asks you what size you are, or
573.869	if you're going dancing or hiking.
576.079	"They just say, ""Well, you have feet, here are your shoes."""
578.887	It doesn't work with shoes, and our bodies are
582.487	many times more complicated than just our feet.
585.959	So we really have to change this.
588.5	There was a very sad example of this in the last decade.
593.684	There's a wonderful drug, and a class of drugs actually,
596.332	but the particular drug was Vioxx, and
599.012	for people who were suffering from severe arthritis pain,
603.388	the drug was an absolute lifesaver,
606.78	but unfortunately, for another subset of those people,
611.86	they suffered pretty severe heart side effects,
616.629	and for a subset of those people, the side effects were
619.357	so severe, the cardiac side effects, that they were fatal.
623.254	But imagine a different scenario,
627.296	where we could have had an array, a genetically diverse array,
631.598	of cardiac cells, and we could have actually tested
635.224	that drug, Vioxx, in petri dishes, and figured out,
640.305	well, okay, people with this genetic type are going to have
644.049	cardiac side effects, people with these genetic subgroups
649.049	or genetic shoes sizes, about 25,000 of them,
654.193	are not going to have any problems.
656.953	The people for whom it was a lifesaver
659.568	could have still taken their medicine.
661.245	The people for whom it was a disaster, or fatal,
665.631	would never have been given it, and
667.722	you can imagine a very different outcome for the company,
670.305	who had to withdraw the drug.
673.073	So that is terrific,
675.889	and we thought, all right,
677.723	as we're trying to solve this problem,
680.482	clearly we have to think about genetics,
682.679	we have to think about human testing,
685.513	but there's a fundamental problem,
687.092	because right now, stem cell lines,
689.791	as extraordinary as they are,
691.501	and lines are just groups of cells,
693.245	they are made by hand, one at a time,
697.577	and it takes a couple of months.
699.801	This is not scalable, and also when you do things by hand,
704.167	even in the best laboratories,
705.71	you have variations in techniques,
708.871	and you need to know, if you're making a drug,
712.052	that the Aspirin you're going to take out of the bottle
713.95	on Monday is the same as the Aspirin
716.39	that's going to come out of the bottle on Wednesday.
718.471	So we looked at this, and we thought, okay,
722.262	artisanal is wonderful in, you know, your clothing
725.414	and your bread and crafts, but
728.358	artisanal really isn't going to work in stem cells,
731.341	so we have to deal with this.
733.731	But even with that, there still was another big hurdle,
737.651	and that actually brings us back to
741.215	the mapping of the human genome, because
743.599	we're all different.
746.31	We know from the sequencing of the human genome
749.142	that it's shown us all of the A's, C's, G's and T's
751.699	that make up our genetic code,
754.167	but that code, by itself, our DNA,
758.436	is like looking at the ones and zeroes of the computer code
763.035	without having a computer that can read it.
765.86	It's like having an app without having a smartphone.
769.148	We needed to have a way of bringing the biology
773.032	to that incredible data,
775.241	and the way to do that was to find
778.356	a stand-in, a biological stand-in,
781.043	that could contain all of the genetic information,
785.068	but have it be arrayed in such a way
787.596	as it could be read together
790.46	and actually create this incredible avatar.
793.716	We need to have stem cells from all the genetic sub-types
797.42	that represent who we are.
800.372	So this is what we've built.
803.132	It's an automated robotic technology.
806.452	It has the capacity to produce thousands and thousands
809.06	of stem cell lines. It's genetically arrayed.
813.299	It has massively parallel processing capability,
817.048	and it's going to change the way drugs are discovered,
820.368	we hope, and I think eventually what's going to happen
824.203	is that we're going to want to re-screen drugs,
826.402	on arrays like this, that already exist,
828.893	all of the drugs that currently exist,
830.764	and in the future, you're going to be taking drugs
833.675	and treatments that have been tested for side effects
836.547	on all of the relevant cells,
838.85	on brain cells and heart cells and liver cells.
842.003	It really has brought us to the threshold
845.332	of personalized medicine.
847.546	It's here now, and in our family,
851.987	my son has type 1 diabetes,
854.925	which is still an incurable disease,
857.573	and I lost my parents to heart disease and cancer,
861.015	but I think that my story probably sounds familiar to you,
864.748	because probably a version of it is your story.
868.978	At some point in our lives, all of us,
872.922	or people we care about, become patients,
875.658	and that's why I think that stem cell research
878.267	is incredibly important for all of us.
881.65	Thank you. (Applause)
885.318	(Applause)
