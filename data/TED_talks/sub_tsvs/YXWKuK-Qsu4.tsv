12.975	Today 40 million Americans are indebted
12.975	for their passage to the new economy.
20.039	Too poor to pay their way through college,
22.167	they now owe lenders
22.167	more than one trillion US dollars.
27.709	They do find what jobs they can get
29.972	to pay off a debt
29.972	that is secured on their person.
33.201	In America,
35.273	even a bankrupt gambler
35.273	gets a second chance.
42.351	But it is nearly impossible
45.177	for an American to get discharged
45.177	their student loan debts.
52.421	Once upon a time in America,
55.165	going to college did not mean
55.165	graduating with debt.
59.299	My friend Paul's father
59.299	graduated from Colorado State University
64.609	on the GI Bill.
67.546	For his generation,
69.158	higher education was free or almost free,
72.03	because it was thought of
72.03	as a public good.
75.676	Not anymore.
78.171	When Paul also graduated
78.171	from Colorado State University,
82.291	he paid for his English degree
82.291	by working part-time.
87.339	higher education tuition
87.339	was affordable, reasonable,
90.03	and what debts you accumulated,
90.03	you paid off by graduation date.
93.952	Not anymore.
95.829	Paul's daughter followed in his footsteps,
99.227	but with one difference:
100.552	when she graduated five years ago,
103.068	it was with a whopping debt.
105.179	Students like Kate have to take on a loan
108.545	because the cost of higher education
108.545	has become unaffordable
111.768	for many if not most American families.
116.427	But so what?
118.117	Getting into debt to buy
118.117	an expensive education
120.689	is not all bad if you could pay it off
123.475	with the increased income
123.475	that you earned from it.
127.266	But that's where the rubber
127.266	meets the road.
131.652	Even a college grad
131.652	earned 10 percent more in 2001
137.272	than she did in 2013.
139.984	So ...
141.779	tuition costs up,
143.462	public funding down,
145.009	family incomes diminished,
147.47	personal incomes weak.
150.241	Is it any wonder that more
150.241	than a quarter of those who must
154.67	cannot make their student loan payments?
158.852	The worst of times
158.852	can be the best of times,
161.853	because certain truths flash up
161.853	in ways that you can't ignore.
166.446	I want to speak of three of them today.
169.571	1.2 trillion dollars of debts for diplomas
173.469	make it abundantly obvious
175.958	that higher education
175.958	is a consumer product you can buy.
180.283	All of us talk about education
180.283	just as the economists do now,
185.125	as an investment that you make
185.125	to improve the human stock
189.63	by training them for work.
191.812	As an investment you make
191.812	to sort and classify people
196.559	so that employers
196.559	can hire them more easily.
200.396	The U.S. News &amp; World Report
200.396	ranks colleges
203.818	just as the consumer report
203.818	rates washing machines.
207.095	The language is peppered with barbarisms.
210.882	"Teachers are called ""service providers,"""
214.287	"students are called ""consumers."""
217.509	Sociology and Shakespeare
217.509	and soccer and science,
221.414	"all of these are ""content."""
225.318	Student debt is profitable.
226.723	Only not on you.
229.961	Your debt fattens the profit
229.961	of the student loan industry.
234.04	The two 800-pound gorillas of which --
236.501	Sallie Mae and Navient --
238.588	posted last year a combined profit
238.588	of 1.2 billion dollars.
244.568	And just like home mortgages,
247.164	student loans can be bundled
247.164	and packaged and sliced and diced,
250.374	and sold on Wall Street.
252.369	And colleges and universities
253.989	that invest in these securitized loans
258.17	profit twice.
259.735	Once from your tuition,
261.18	and then again from the interest on debt.
265.108	With all that money to be made,
267.498	are we surprised that some
267.498	in the higher education business
273.109	have begun to engage in false advertising,
275.205	in bait and switch ...
278.585	in exploiting the very ignorance
278.585	that they pretend to educate?
284.144	Third:
285.678	diplomas are a brand.
287.741	Many years ago my teacher wrote,
290.116	"""When students are treated as consumers,"
292.681	they're made prisoners
292.681	"of addiction and envy."""
299.794	Just as consumers can be sold and resold
299.794	upgraded versions of an iPhone,
304.359	so also people can be sold
304.359	more and more education.
308.807	College is the new high school,
310.697	we already say that.
313.408	But why stop there?
314.831	People can be upsold
314.831	on certifications and recertifications,
318.332	master's degrees, doctoral degrees.
323.436	Higher education is also marketed
323.436	as a status object.
328.634	Buy a degree,
329.809	much like you do a Lexus
329.809	of a Louis Vuitton bag,
333.02	to distinguish yourself from others.
334.838	So you can be the object
334.838	of envy of others.
338.669	Diplomas are a brand.
341.034	But these truths are often times
341.034	hidden by a very noisy sales pitch.
348.535	There is not a day that goes by
350.195	without some policy guy
350.195	on television telling us,
355.256	"""A college degree is absolutely essential"
357.304	to get on that up escalator
357.304	"to a middle-class life."""
360.89	And the usual evidence offered
360.89	is the college premium:
364.592	a college grad who makes on average
370.425	Let's look at that number more carefully,
372.497	because on the face of it,
373.847	it seems to belie the stories we all hear
377.215	about college grads
377.215	working as baristas and cashiers.
382.545	Of 100 people who enroll
382.545	in any form of post-secondary education,
390.792	for a number of reasons,
390.792	including financial.
394.275	Of the 55 that do graduate,
396.212	two will remain unemployed,
398.284	and another 18 are underemployed.
402.058	So, college grads earn more
402.058	than high school grads,
405.757	but does it pay for the exorbitant tuition
408.774	and the lost wages while at college?
411.661	Now even economists admit
414.281	going to college pays off
414.281	for only those who complete it.
420.095	But that's only because high school wages
420.095	have been cut to the bone,
424.151	for decades now.
427.369	For decades,
429.282	workers with a high school degree
431.663	have been denied a fair share
431.663	of what they have produced.
436.48	And had they received as they should have,
439.409	then going to college would have been
439.409	a bad investment for many.
443.386	College premium?
445.941	I think it's a high school discount.
448.688	Two out of three people who enroll
448.688	are not going to find an adequate job.
453.756	And the future, for them,
453.756	doesn't look particularly promising --
456.891	in fact, it's downright bleak.
458.637	And it is they who are going to suffer
462.541	the most punishing forms of student debt.
466.002	And it is they,
467.177	curiously and sadly,
468.582	who are marketed most loudly
468.582	about this college premium thing.
473.986	That's not just cynical marketing,
476.407	that's cruel.
479.277	So what do we do?
481.279	What if students and parents treated
481.279	higher education as a consumer product?
488.199	Everybody else seems to.
490.686	Then, like any other consumer product,
492.972	you would demand to know
492.972	what you're paying for.
495.495	When you buy medicines,
496.734	you get a list of side effects.
498.673	When you buy a higher educational product,
500.809	you should have a warning label
502.467	that allows consumers to choose,
504.683	make informed choices.
506.838	When you buy a car,
508.054	it tells you how many
508.054	miles per gallon to expect.
511.188	Who knows what to expect
512.658	from a degree say, in Canadian Studies.
516.806	There is such a thing, by the way.
520.989	What if there was an app for that?
526.402	One that linked up the cost of a major
526.402	to the expected income.
532.208	Let's call it Income-Based Tuition or IBT.
534.598	One of you make this.
536.144	(Laughter)
537.707	Discover your reality.
539.463	(Laughter)
541.796	There are three advantages,
543.249	three benefits to Income-Based Tuition.
547.232	Any user can figure out
549.145	how much money he or she will make
549.145	from a given college and major.
553.105	Such informed users
554.471	are unlikely to fall victim
554.471	to the huckster's ploy,
558.44	to the sales pitch.
559.874	But also to choose wisely.
561.604	Why would anybody pay more for college
564.03	than let's say, 15 percent
564.03	of the additional income they earn?
569.04	There's a second benefit
569.04	to Income-Based Tuition.
571.78	By tying the cost to the income,
574.764	college administrators would be forced
574.764	to manage costs better,
579.209	to find innovative ways to do so.
581.573	For instance,
582.751	all of you students here pay roughly
582.751	the same tuition for every major.
587.478	That is manifestly unfair,
587.478	and should change.
592.295	An engineering student uses more resources
596.24	and facilities and labs and faculty
598.673	than a philosophy student.
601.581	But the philosophy student,
601.581	as a consequence,
603.709	is subsidizing the engineering student.
606.3	Who then, by the way,
606.3	goes on and earns more money.
609.015	Why should two people
609.015	buy the same product,
612.746	pay the same,
613.945	but one person receive
613.945	half or a third of the service.
618.448	In fact, college grads, some majors,
622.543	pay 25 percent of their income
622.543	servicing their student debt,
626.187	while others pay five percent.
629.51	That kind if inequity would end
629.51	when majors are priced more correctly.
635.042	Now of course, all this data --
637.225	and one of you is going to do this, right?
639.323	All this data has to be well designed,
641.194	maybe audited by public accounting firms
643.316	to avoid statistical lies.
645.292	We know about statistics, right?
648.766	But be that as it may,
650.013	the third and biggest benefit
650.013	of Income-Based Tuition,
654.418	is it would free Americans from the fear
654.418	and the fact of financial ruin
659.871	because they bought a defective product.
662.813	Perhaps, in time,
665.156	young and old Americans may rediscover,
667.428	as the gentleman said earlier,
669.649	their curiosity, their love of learning --
671.712	begin to study what they love,
673.173	love what they study,
674.376	follow their passion ...
676.577	getting stimulated by their intelligence,
679.07	follow paths of inquiry
679.07	that they really want to.
682.848	After all, it was Eric and Kevin,
687.322	two years ago,
689.498	just exactly these kinds of young men,
692.954	who prompted me and worked with me,
695	and still do,
696.585	in the study of indebted
696.585	students in America.
701.272	Thank you for your attention.
702.827	(Applause)
