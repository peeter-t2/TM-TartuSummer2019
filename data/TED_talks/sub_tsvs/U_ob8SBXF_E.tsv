150.33	Thank you very much.
151.33	Good morning everybody.
152.33	We are They Might Be Giants.
154.33	(Applause)
158.33	I am wearing the Al Gore in-ear monitors
160.33	he wore on the Larry King show
164.33	and I'm hearing that transmission and not mine.
167.33	But I guess that's in keeping,
169.33	so now we'll just move to the PowerPoint presentation,
171.33	ladies and gentlemen.
173.33	This is a brand new song.
175.33	In the spirit of TED, we're bringing you something
177.33	that has not been released.
181.33	John, do you want to introduce the song?
182.33	This is a song about a creature called a hummingbird moth
185.33	which imitates another creature
187.33	which imitates yet another creature.
191.33	It's completely fucked up
192.33	and can only be explained in song.
198.33	♫ Everyone is crying at the dread hypnotic flying ♫
203.33	♫ of the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫
207.33	♫ You can't walk, you can't ramble ♫
210.33	♫ 'cause you're gonna have to scramble ♫
213.33	♫ from the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫
217.33	♫ Catbird is a cat ♫
220.33	♫ but he's got bugness in his veins. ♫
223.33	♫ Manhouse lives within himself ♫
225.33	♫ with thoughtful human brains. ♫
228.33	♫ Neither one is equal 
228.33	♫
230.33	♫ to the challenge of the freak we'll call ♫
233.33	♫ the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫
240.33	♫ Now the moth ♫
242.33	♫ defeats the mouse and man. ♫
244.33	♫ It's messing with the plan. ♫
247.33	♫ It can't be believed ♫
250.33	♫ 'cause it's just a hummingbird moth ♫
254.33	♫ who's acting like the bird ♫
257.33	♫ that thinks it's a bee. ♫
261.33	♫ Got a brand new shipment ♫
263.33	♫ of electrical equipment ♫
266.33	♫ it's addressed to the bottom of the sea. ♫
271.33	♫ Send a tangerine-colored ♫
273.33	♫ nuclear submarine ♫
276.33	♫ with a sticker that says STP. ♫
281.33	♫ Windshield wiper washer fluid ♫
283.33	♫ spraying in the air ... ♫
286.33	♫ headlights under head lice ♫
288.33	♫ under hats lie everywhere. ♫
291.33	♫ Subatomic waves ♫
293.33	♫ to the underwater caves ♫
295.33	♫ of the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫
318.33	♫ Now the moth defeats the mouse and man. ♫
322.33	♫ It's messing with the plan. ♫
325.33	♫ It can't be believed ♫
328.33	♫ 'cause it's just a hummingbird moth ♫
332.33	♫ who's acting like a bird ♫
335.33	♫ that thinks it's a bee. ♫
338.33	♫ Is it us or is this messed up? ♫
343.33	♫ Everyone's deforming ♫
345.33	♫ in the presence of the swarming ♫
348.33	♫ of the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫
353.33	♫ Protozoa, snakes and horses ♫
355.33	♫ have enlisted in the forces ♫
358.33	♫ of the bee of bird of the moth. ♫
364.33	♫ Catbug is a cat ♫
365.33	♫ but he's got bugness in his veins. ♫
368.33	♫ Manhouse lives within himself ♫
371.33	♫ with thoughtful human brains. ♫
373.33	♫ Neither one is equal ♫
375.33	♫ to the challenge of the freak we'll call ♫
378.33	♫ the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫
402.33	(Applause)
403.33	Thanks a lot.
405.33	Thank you very much.
408.33	So we are past our 1,000th show.
413.33	Probably somewhere around 1,500.
414.33	It's hard to know.
416.33	We've only done two shows in 2007 so far,
419.33	but our first show
420.33	was actually the coldest performance we've ever had.
424.33	It was 19 degrees in St. Louis about a month ago
428.33	and I'm happy to report
430.33	that this performance you are seeing today
432.33	is the earliest we have ever performed.
435.33	So thank you.
440.33	We are cultural test pilots, ladies and gentlemen.
443.33	How early can a rock performance begin?
450.33	Not all the facts are in about performing
452.33	at 8.30 in the morning.
457.33	I can tell you the 19 degree thing
460.33	was fantastic.
469.33	All right.
470.33	So we don't know that much
472.33	about the history of violinists
474.33	but we do know that when we entered
475.33	the state of New Jersey
476.33	there is an uptick in violence.
480.33	"This song is called ""Asbury Park."""
482.33	It's based on a real life experience.
488.33	♫ I ♫
490.33	♫ I got ♫

527.33	♫ Not me! ♫
529.33	♫ Not me! ♫
530.33	♫ Not me! ♫
532.33	Thank you.

541.33	We want to get in as many songs as possible
544.33	during our brief time here
546.33	so this is the one to play.

793.33	♫ We're taking calls -- from the dead. ♫
795.33	♫ We're taking calls -- from the dead. ♫
798.33	♫ We're taking phone calls from the dead. ♫

806.33	♫ They have some questions ♫
807.33	♫ And things to share ♫
808.33	♫ From underneath the cold, cold ground. ♫
813.33	We're soliciting phone calls from dead people
817.33	as a special TED presentation.
818.33	We're taking calls live on stage
821.33	here at TED in Monterey.
824.33	And I think we have a caller coming in here.
829.33	Hello there.
831.33	You're live.
833.33	Hello. Who's there, please?
836.33	Am I on the air?
838.33	Hi there.
839.33	You're on with They Might Be Giants.
841.33	This is Eleanor Roosevelt.
842.33	Hello, Eleanor, please ...
843.33	I want to talk to ...
844.33	Please turn off your radio, Eleanor.
847.33	I wanna talk to Randi.
848.33	I've got a question for Randi.
850.33	What's your question, please?
853.33	I want to talk to the Amazing Randi.
856.33	Do you have a laminated badge, Eleanor?
861.33	I want my million dollars.
864.33	Eleanor, I'm sorry,
865.33	do you have a laminated badge?
866.33	No, I don't have a badge.
869.33	Well, I think we're going to stop
870.33	that part of the show.
874.33	Here's a song we like to think of
876.33	as the future anthem of TED.
877.33	It's actually a children's song
879.33	but like so many projects for children
881.33	it's really just a Trojan horse
884.33	for adult work.
886.33	This song is called
888.33	"""The Alphabet ..."
893.33	"Of Nations!"""
