13.103	How do we build a society
16.253	without fossil fuels?
18.944	This is a very complex challenge,
21.92	and I believe developing countries
21.92	could take the lead in this transition.
27.12	And I'm aware that this
27.12	is a contentious statement,
30.44	but the reality is that so much
30.44	is at stake in our countries
35.76	if we let fossil fuels stay
35.76	at the center of our development.
41.24	We can do it differently.
44.2	And it's time, it really is time,
47.48	to debunk the myth
50.2	that a country has to choose
50.2	between development on the one hand
55.28	and environmental protection,
55.28	renewables, quality of life, on the other.
61.8	I come from Costa Rica,
61.8	a developing country.
64.68	We are nearly five million people,
68.2	and we live right in the middle
68.2	of the Americas,
70.8	so it's very easy
70.8	to remember where we live.
75.08	Nearly 100 percent of our electricity
82.4	comes from renewable sources,
84.88	five of them.
86.12	(Applause)
90.8	Hydropower, geothermal,
94.68	wind, solar, biomass.
99	Did you know that last year,
101.16	for 299 days,
104.64	we did not use any fossil fuels
107.88	in order to generate all our electricity?
112.24	It's a fantastic achievement,
116.36	and yet, it hides a paradox,
123.08	which is that nearly 70 percent
126.16	of all our energy consumption is oil.
131.88	Why?
133.8	Because of our transportation system,
136.56	which is totally dependent
136.56	on fossil fuels,
139.84	like it is in most countries.
142.479	So if we think of the energy
142.479	transition as a marathon,
146.04	the question is, how do we get
146.04	to the finish line,
149.96	how do we decarbonize
149.96	the rest of the economy?
153.88	And it's fair to say
153.88	that if we don't succeed,
156.8	it's difficult to see who will.
158.6	So that is why I want
158.6	to talk to you about Costa Rica,
162.16	because I believe we are a great candidate
164.88	in pioneering a vision
164.88	for development without fossil fuels.
171.2	If you know one thing about our country,
174.48	it's that we don't have an army.
177.44	So I'm going to take you back to 1948.
181.4	That year, the country
181.4	was coming out of civil war.
186.36	Thousands of Costa Ricans had died,
189.96	and families were bitterly split.
193.24	And yet, a surprising idea
193.24	won the hearts and minds:
198.28	we would reboot the country,
200.2	and that Second Republic
200.2	would have no army.
203.28	So we abolished it.
205.36	And the president at the time,
208.04	Jos√© Figueres,
210.24	found a powerful way
210.24	by smashing the walls of an army base.
217.2	The following year, 1949,
220.4	we made that decision permanent
220.4	in the new constitution,
224.6	and that is why I can tell you that story
224.6	nearly 70 years later.
229.52	And I'm grateful.
231.56	I'm grateful they made that decision
231.56	before I was born,
235.28	because it allowed me
235.28	and millions of others
237.56	to live in a very stable country.
241.2	And you might be thinking
241.2	that it was good luck,
244.16	but it wasn't.
245.68	There was a pattern of deliberate choices.
250.08	In the '40s, Costa Ricans were given
250.08	free education and free health care.
256.16	We called that social guarantees.
258.76	By abolishing the army,
260.4	we were able to turn military spending
260.4	into social spending,
265.36	and that was a driver of stability.
268.12	In the '50s --
269.399	(Applause)
274.6	In the '50s, we started
274.6	investing in hydropower,
278	and that kept us away from the trap
280.68	of using fossil fuels
280.68	for electricity generation,
283.76	which is what the world
283.76	is struggling with today.
287.16	In the '70s we invested in national parks,
290.72	and that kept us away
293.64	from the deeply flawed logic
293.64	of growth, growth, growth at any cost
298.32	that you see others embracing,
298.32	especially in the developing world.
302.8	In the '90s, we pioneered payments
302.8	for ecosystem services,
306.92	and that helped us reverse deforestation
308.88	and boosted ecotourism,
308.88	which today is a key engine of growth.
313	So investing in environmental protection
315.96	did not hurt our economy.
318.2	Quite the opposite.
319.48	And it doesn't mean we are perfect,
321.52	and it doesn't mean
321.52	we don't have contradictions.
323.88	That's not the point.
325.72	The point is that,
325.72	by making our own choices,
329.24	we were able to develop resilience
329.24	in dealing with development problems.
336.08	Also, if you take a country like ours,
339.68	the GDP per capita
339.68	is around 11,000 dollars,
343.6	depending on how you measure it.
346.08	But according to
346.08	the Social Progress Index,
348.16	we are an absolute outlier
350.08	when it comes to turning GDP
350.08	into social progress.
354	Abolishing the army,
355.56	investing in nature and people,
357.4	did something very powerful, too.
361.12	It shaped the narrative,
364	the narrative of a small country
364	with big ideas,
366.64	and it was very empowering
366.64	to grow up with that narrative.
371.52	So the question is,
373.72	what is the next big idea
373.72	for this generation?
378.32	And I believe what comes next
380.72	is for this generation
380.72	to let go of fossil fuels for good,
387.64	just as we did with the army.
390.4	Fossil fuels create climate change.
392.72	We know that,
394.12	and we know how vulnerable we are
394.12	to the impacts of climate change.
398.64	So as a developing country,
398.64	it is in our best interest
402.32	to build development without fossil fuels
404.32	that harm people in the first place.
408.88	Because
411	why would we continue importing oil
415.8	for transportation
417.56	if we can use electricity instead?
420.72	Remember,
422.56	this is the country
424.48	where electricity
424.48	comes from water in our rivers,
430.56	heat from volcanoes,
433.08	wind turbines, solar panels,
436.44	biowaste.
438.56	Abolishing fossil fuels means
438.56	disrupting our transportation system
444.88	so that we can power our cars,
444.88	buses and trains with electricity
450.24	instead of dirty energy.
452.4	And transportation, let me tell you,
454.84	has become an existential issue
454.84	for us Costa Ricans,
458.92	because the model we have
458.92	is not working for us.
461.36	It's hurting people,
463.48	it's hurting companies,
465.24	and it's hurting our health.
467.24	Because when policies
467.24	and infrastructure fail,
472	this is what happens on a daily basis.
476.8	Two hours in the morning,
478.4	two hours in the evening.
480.24	I don't understand why
480.24	we have to accept this as normal.
484.8	It's offensive
487.04	to have to waste our time like this
487.04	every single day.
491.92	And this highway is actually quite good
493.84	compared to what you see
493.84	in other countries
495.92	where traffic is exploding.
498	"You know, Costa Ricans call this ""presa."""
501.28	"Presa means ""imprisoned."""
504.36	And people are turning violent
507.36	in a country that is otherwise
507.36	happy in pura vida.
512.04	It's happening.
513.88	So a lot is at stake.
516.56	The good news
518.44	is that when we talk
518.44	about clean transportation
521.48	and different mobility,
522.76	we're not talking about
522.76	some distant utopia out there.
527.799	We're talking about electric mobility
527.799	that is happening today.
533.039	By 2022, electric cars
533.039	and conventional cars
538.52	are expected to cost the same,
541.52	and cities are already trying
541.52	electric buses.
545.8	And these really cool creatures
548.76	are saving money,
551	and they reduce pollution.
553.48	So if we want to get rid
553.48	of oil-based transportation, we can,
557.48	because we have options now
557.48	that we didn't have before.
560.12	It's really exciting.
562.76	But of course,
565.28	some get very uncomfortable
565.28	with this idea,
569.76	and they will come and they will tell you
572.96	that the world is stuck with oil,
572.96	and so is Costa Rica, so get real.
577.8	That's what they tell you.
579.08	And you know what the answer
579.08	to that argument is?
581.44	That in 1948, we didn't say
581.44	the world is stuck with armies,
585.04	so let's keep our army, too.
587	No, we made a very brave choice,
590.64	and that choice made the whole difference.
593.6	So it's time for this generation
593.6	to be brave again
598	and abolish fossil fuels for good.
599.8	And I'll give you three reasons
599.8	why we have to do this.
603.24	First,
605.12	our model of transportation
605.12	and urbanization is broken,
608.88	so this is the best moment
608.88	to redefine our urban and mobility future.
614.52	We don't want cities
614.52	that are built for cars.
617.36	We want cities for people
619.72	where we can walk and we can use bikes.
623.6	And we want public transportation,
625.76	lots of it,
627.28	public transportation
627.28	that is clean and dignifying.
631.2	Because if we continue
631.2	adding fleets of conventional cars,
636.76	our cities will become unbearable.
640	Second, we have to change,
641.76	but incremental change
641.76	is not going to be sufficient.
646.72	We need transformational change.
649.6	And there are some
649.6	incremental projects in my country,
652.48	and I am the first one to celebrate them.
655.8	But let's not kid ourselves.
658.2	We're not talking about ending up
658.2	with really beautiful electric cars here
662.12	and a few electric buses there
664.76	while we keep investing
664.76	in the same kind of infrastructure,
668.16	more cars, more roads, more oil.
670.68	We're talking about
670.68	breaking free from oil,
675	and you cannot get there
675	through incrementalism.
680.36	Third, and you know this one,
685.08	the world is hungry for inspiration.
690.12	It craves stories of success
693.24	in dealing with complex issues,
695.04	especially in developing countries.
699.4	So I believe Costa Rica
699.4	can be an inspiration to others,
703.72	as we did last year when we disclosed
706.48	that for so many days
706.48	we were not using any fossil fuels
710.48	in order to generate all our electricity.
715.36	The news went viral around the world.
719.64	Also, and this makes me extremely proud,
722.76	a Costa Rican woman, Christiana Figueres,
727.48	played a decisive role in the negotiations
727.48	of the Paris climate agreement.
734.6	So we have to protect that legacy
734.6	and be an example.
739.4	So what comes next?
742.24	The people.
744.28	How do we get people to own this?
747.76	How do we get people
749.88	to believe that it's possible
752.32	to build a society without fossil fuels?
756.04	A lot of work from
756.04	the ground up is needed.
761.12	That is why, in 2014,
761.12	we created Costa Rica Limpia.
765.72	"""Limpia"" means ""clean,"""
768.44	because we want to empower
768.44	and we want to inspire citizens.
772.76	If citizens don't get engaged,
777.08	clean transportation decisions
777.08	will be bogged down by endless,
781.76	and I mean endless, technical discussions,
784.76	and by avalanches of lobbying
784.76	by various established interests.
792.72	Wanting to be a green country
792.72	powered by renewables
796.6	is already part of our story.
799.2	We should not let anybody
799.2	take that away from us.
804.08	Last year, we brought people
804.08	from our seven provinces
808.56	to talk about climate change
808.56	in terms that matter to them,
812.72	and we also brought this year
815.64	another group of Costa Ricans
817.72	to talk about renewable energy.
819.84	And you know what?
821.12	These people disagree on almost everything
823.4	except on renewable energy
826.08	and clean transportation and clean air.
828.2	It brings people together.
830.2	And the key to real participation
833.08	is to help people not to feel small.
835.32	People feel powerless,
836.64	and they are tired of not being heard.
841	So what we do is concrete things,
843.4	and we translate technical issues
843.4	into citizen language
847.92	to show that citizens have a role to play
847.92	and can play it together.
852.48	For the first time, we're tracking
852.48	the promises that were made
855.72	on clean transportation,
857.24	and politicos know
857.24	that they have to deliver it,
859.88	but the tipping point will come
859.88	when we form coalitions --
863.96	citizens, companies,
865.84	champions of public transportation --
868.04	that will make electric mobility
868.04	the new normal,
870.84	especially in a developing country.
874.56	By the time the next election comes,
878.28	I believe every candidate
878.28	will have to disclose where they stand
881.72	on the abolition of fossil fuels.
883.64	Because this question
883.64	has to enter our mainstream politics.
888.52	And I'm telling you,
888.52	this is not a question of climate policy
892	or environmental agenda.
894.76	It's about the country that we want
898.16	and the cities that we have
900.28	and the cities that we want
901.96	and who makes that choice.
904.16	Because at the end of the day,
904.16	what we have to show
907.36	is that development with renewable energy
910.52	is good for the people,
913.44	for Costa Ricans that are alive today
915.88	and especially for those
915.88	who haven't been born.
921.56	This is our National Museum today.
924.64	It's bright and peaceful,
926.36	and when you stand up in front of it,
929.08	it's really hard to believe
929.08	these were military barracks
932.4	at the end of the '40s.
934.6	We started a new life
934.6	without an army in this place,
938.44	and here is where our abolition
942.32	of fossil fuels will be announced one day.
945.24	And we will make history again.
947.56	Thank you.
948.8	(Applause)
