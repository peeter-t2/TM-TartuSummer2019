12.68	For over a decade,
14.68	I have studied young people
14.68	that have been pushed out of school,
19.76	"so called ""dropouts."""
22.32	As they end up failed
22.32	by the education system,
25.8	they're on the streets
25.8	where they're vulnerable to violence,
29.36	police harassment,
30.84	police brutality
32.32	and incarceration.
34.6	I follow these young people
34.6	for years at a time,
38.8	across institutional settings,
41.24	to try to understand what some of us call
41.24	"the ""school-to-prison pipeline."""
48.72	When you look at a picture like this,
50.72	of young people who are in my study ...
55.44	you might see trouble.
56.88	I mean one of the boys
56.88	has a bottle of liquor in his hand,
61.08	he's 14 years old
63.24	and it's a school day.
65.44	Other people, when they see this picture,
67.96	might see gangs,
70	thugs, delinquents --
72.12	criminals.
73.68	But I see it different.
76	I see these young people
76	through a perspective
79.52	that looks at the assets
79.52	that they bring to the education system.
84.32	So will you join me in changing
84.32	the way we label young people
89.36	"from ""at-risk"" to ""at-promise?"""
94.48	(Applause)
101.8	How do I know that these young people
103.64	have the potential
103.64	and the promise to change?
107.12	I know this because I am one of them.
110.68	You see, I grew up
110.68	in dire poverty in the inner city,
115.04	without a father --
116.28	he abandoned me before I was even born.
119.28	We were on welfare,
121.12	sometimes homeless,
122.44	many times hungry.
124.72	By the time I was 15 years old,
127.04	I had been incarcerated in juvy
127.04	three times for three felonies.
132.24	My best friend had already been killed.
135.76	And soon after,
137.28	while I'm standing next to my uncle,
139.84	he gets shot.
141.56	And as I'm waiting
141.56	for the ambulance to arrive
144.08	for over an hour ...
148	he bleeds to death on the street.
152.6	I had lost faith and hope in the world,
156.36	and I had given up on the system
156.36	because the system had failed me.
160.52	I had nothing to offer
162.64	and no one had anything to offer me.
167.16	I was fatalistic.
168.76	I didn't even think
168.76	I could make it to my 18th birthday.
172.44	The reason I'm here today
174.68	is because a teacher
174.68	that cared reached out
179.2	and managed to tap into my soul.
183	This teacher,
184.4	Ms. Russ ...
187.92	she was the kind of teacher
187.92	that was always in your business.
192.24	(Laughter)
194	She was the kind of teacher that was like,
196.48	"""Victor, I'm here for you"
196.48	"whenever you're ready."""
199.64	(Laughter)
201.88	I wasn't ready.
203.56	But she understood one basic principle
203.56	about young people like me.
207.84	We're like oysters.
209.76	We're only going to open up
209.76	when we're ready,
212.52	and if you're not there when we're ready,
215.96	we're going to clam back up.
218.4	Ms. Russ was there for me.
220.12	She was culturally relevant,
222.16	she respected my community,
222.16	my people, my family.
226.32	I told her a story about my Uncle Ruben.
230.24	He would take me to work with him
230.24	because I was broke,
232.92	and he knew I needed some money.
234.8	He collected glass bottles for a living.
238.64	Four in the morning on a school day,
240.4	we'd throw the glass bottles
240.4	in the back of his van,
243.76	and the bottles would break.
245.76	And my hands and arms would start to bleed
247.84	and my tennis shoes and pants
247.84	would get all bloody.
252.32	And I was terrified and in pain,
252.32	and I would stop working.
256.88	And my uncle, he would look me in the eyes
256.88	and he would say to me,
260.2	"""Mijo,"
261.56	"estamos buscando vida."""
265.04	"""We're searching for a better life,"
267.6	we're trying to make
267.6	"something out of nothing."""
272.88	Ms. Russ listened to my story,
275.72	welcomed it into the classroom and said,
278.24	"""Victor, this is your power."
280.92	This is your potential.
282.84	Your family, your culture, your community
282.84	have taught you a hard-work ethic
288.16	and you will use it to empower
288.16	yourself in the academic world
293.52	so you can come back
293.52	"and empower your community."""
298.52	With Ms. Russ's help,
300.44	I ended up returning to school.
303.48	I even finished my credits on time
307.48	and graduated with my class.
310.16	(Applause)
317.76	But Ms. Russ said to me
317.76	right before graduation,
320.44	"""Victor, I'm so proud of you."
323.72	I knew you could do it.
325.72	"Now it's time to go to college."""
328.96	(Laughter)
331.32	College, me?
332.56	Man, what is this teacher smoking
332.56	thinking I'm going to college?
336.48	I applied with the mentors
336.48	and support she provided,
340.92	got a letter of acceptance,
343.04	and one of the paragraphs read,
345.28	"""You've been admitted"
345.28	"under probationary status."""
349.4	"I said, ""Probation?"
349.4	I'm already on probation,
351.92	"that don't matter?"""
353.16	(Laughter)
354.44	It was academic probation,
354.44	not criminal probation.
359.32	But what do teachers like Ms. Russ
359.32	do to succeed with young people
363.16	like the ones I study?
365.08	I propose three strategies.
367.28	The first:
368.52	let's get rid of our
368.52	deficit perspective in education.
372.72	"""These people"
372.72	come from a culture of violence,
375	a culture of poverty.
376.28	These people are at-risk;
376.28	these people are truant.
378.88	These people are empty containers
378.88	for us to fill with knowledge.
385.04	They have the problems,
386.72	"we have the solutions."""
390.2	Number two.
391.84	Let's value the stories that young people
391.84	bring to the schoolhouse.
397.56	Their stories of overcoming
397.56	insurmountable odds are so powerful.
403.08	And I know you know some of these stories.
408.84	These very same stories and experiences
412.12	already have grit, character
412.12	and resilience in them.
417.64	So let's help young people
417.64	refine those stories.
420.84	Let's help them be proud of who they are,
422.84	because our education system
422.84	welcomes their families, their cultures,
426.8	their communities
428.04	and the skill set
428.04	they've learned to survive.
431.68	And of course the third strategy
431.68	being the most important:
435.84	resources.
437.08	We have to provide
437.08	adequate resources to young people.
442.04	Grit alone isn't going to cut it.
446.08	You can sit there
446.08	and tell me all you want,
448.28	"""Hey man, pick yourself up"
448.28	"by the bootstraps."""
451.44	But if I was born
451.44	without any straps on my boots --
454.52	(Laughter)
455.76	How am I supposed to pick myself up?
457.52	(Applause)
465.52	Job training,
466.76	mentoring,
468	counseling ...
469.72	Teaching young people
469.72	to learn from their mistakes
472.48	instead of criminalizing them,
474.2	and dragging them out
474.2	of their classrooms like animals.
479.4	How about this?
480.64	I propose that we implement restorative
480.64	justice in every high school in America.
486.4	(Applause)
493.2	So we went out to test these ideas
493.2	in the community of Watts in LA
499.08	with 40 young people
499.08	that had been pushed out of school.
502.36	William was one of them.
504.6	William was the kind of kid
504.6	that had been given every label.
508.92	He had dropped out, he was a gang member,
512.16	a criminal.
514.2	And when we met him he was very resistant.
516.8	But I remember what Ms. Russ used to say.
519.24	"""Hey, I'm here for you"
519.24	"whenever you're ready."""
522.56	(Laughter)
524.039	So over time --
526.48	over time he began to open up.
528.72	And I remember the day
528.72	that he made the switch.
531.96	We were in a large group
533.64	and a young lady in our program was crying
536.76	because she told us her powerful story
540.52	of her dad being killed
543.72	and then his body being shown
543.72	in the newspaper the next day.
551.96	And as she's crying,
551.96	I don't know what to do,
554.2	so I give her her space,
555.96	and William had enough.
558.64	He slammed his hands
558.64	on the desk and he said,
561.64	"""Hey, everybody! Group hug! Group hug!"""
567.64	(Applause)
575.16	This young lady's tears and pain
575.16	turned into joy and laughter
581.2	knowing that her community had her back,
585.8	and William had now learned
585.8	that he did have a purpose in life:
590.6	to help to heal the souls
590.6	of people in his own community.
596.52	He told us his story.
598.2	We refined his story
600	to go from being the story of a victim
600	to being the story of a survivor
604.84	that has overcome adversity.
607.24	We placed high value on it.
609.68	William went on to finish high school,
614.36	get his security guard certificate
614.36	to become a security guard,
619.12	and is now working
619.12	at a local school district.
623	(Applause)
631.76	Ms. Russ's mantra --
633.36	her mantra was always,
635.64	"""when you teach to the heart,"
635.64	"the mind will follow."""
642.6	The great writer Khalil Gibran says,
647.2	"""Out of suffering"
647.2	have emerged the greatest souls.
652.44	The massive characters
652.44	"are seared with scars."""
658.04	I believe that in this education
658.04	revolution that we're talking about
663.72	we need to invite the souls
663.72	of the young people that we work with,
668.68	and once they're able to refine --
670.96	identify their grit,
670.96	resilience and character
674.04	that they've already developed --
677.08	their academic performance will improve.
683.36	Let's believe in young people.
685.72	Let's provide them
685.72	the right kinds of resources.
689.04	I'll tell you what my teacher did for me.
691.72	She believed in me so much
695.12	that she tricked me
695.12	into believing in myself.
699.24	Thank you.
700.48	(Applause)
