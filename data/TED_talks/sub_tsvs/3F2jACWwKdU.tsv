15.781	We most certainly do talk to terrorists, no question about it.
20.616	We are at war with a new form of terrorism.
26.502	It's sort of the good old, traditional form of terrorism,
30.004	but it's sort of been packaged for the 21st century.
33.466	One of the big things about countering terrorism
37.914	is, how do you perceive it?
41.246	Because perception leads to your response to it.
44.742	So if you have a traditional perception of terrorism,
48.97	it would be that it's one of criminality, one of war.
52.918	So how are you going to respond to it?
54.531	Naturally, it would follow that you meet kind with kind.
58.165	You fight it. If you have a more modernist approach,
61.996	and your perception of terrorism is almost cause-and-effect,
66.252	then naturally from that, the responses that come out of it
70.215	are much more asymmetrical.
73.863	We live in a modern, global world.
77.97	Terrorists have actually adapted to it.
81.452	It's something we have to, too, and that means the people
85.201	who are working on counterterrorism responses
88.341	have to start, in effect, putting on
91.165	their Google-tinted glasses, or whatever.
95.419	For my part, what I wanted us to do was just to look at
100.212	terrorism as though it was a global brand,
103.716	say, Coca-Cola.
105.345	Both are fairly bad for your health. (Laughter)
111.362	If you look at it as a brand in those ways,
115.392	what you'll come to realize is, it's a pretty flawed product.
118.656	As we've said, it's pretty bad for your health,
121.749	it's bad for those who it affects,
123.755	and it's not actually good if you're a suicide bomber either.
126.788	It doesn't actually do what it says on the tin.
130.404	You're not really going to get 72 virgins in heaven.
135.396	It's not going to happen, I don't think.
137.866	And you're not really going to, in the '80s, end capitalism
141.844	by supporting one of these groups. It's a load of nonsense.
144.765	But what you realize, it's got an Achilles' heel.
148.043	The brand has an Achilles' heel.
150.796	We've mentioned the health,
152.563	but it needs consumers to buy into it.
156.243	The consumers it needs are the terrorist constituency.
160.323	They're the people who buy into the brand, support them,
163.024	facilitate them, and they're the people
166.332	we've got to reach out to.
168.847	We've got to attack that brand in front of them.
171.707	There's two essential ways of doing that, if we carry on this brand theme.
175.96	One is reducing their market. What I mean is,
179.238	it's their brand against our brand. We've got to compete.
184.014	We've got to show we're a better product.
186.266	If I'm trying to show we're a better product,
189.423	I probably wouldn't do things like Guantanamo Bay.
194.354	We've talked there about curtailing the underlying need
198.019	for the product itself. You could be looking there at
201.667	poverty, injustice, all those sorts of things
205.252	which feed terrorism.
206.781	The other thing to do is to knock the product,
210.513	attack the brand myth, as we've said.
212.708	You know, there's nothing heroic about killing a young kid.
216.067	Perhaps we need to focus on that and get that message back across.
220.763	We've got to reveal the dangers in the product.
223.857	Our target audience, it's not just the producers of terrorism,
227.506	as I've said, the terrorists.
228.707	It's not just the marketeers of terrorism,
231.094	which is those who finance, those who facilitate it,
235.901	but it's the consumers of terrorism.
237.814	We've got to get in to those homelands.
241.048	That's where they recruit from. That's where they get their power and strength.
244.517	That's where their consumers come from.
246.869	And we have to get our messaging in there.
250.781	So the essentials are, we've got to have interaction
254.63	in those areas, with the terrorists, the facilitators, etc.
257.973	We've got to engage, we've got to educate,
261.108	and we've got to have dialogue.
263.911	Now, staying on this brand thing for just a few more seconds,
268.062	think about delivery mechanisms.
271.314	How are we going to do these attacks?
272.947	Well, reducing the market is really one for governments
275.956	and civil society. We've got to show we're better.
279.474	We've got to show our values.
283.316	We've got to practice what we preach.
285.618	But when it comes to knocking the brand,
287.831	if the terrorists are Coca-Cola and we're Pepsi,
292.303	I don't think, being Pepsi, anything we say about Coca-Cola,
296.317	anyone's going to believe us.
298.199	So we've got to find a different mechanism,
300.524	and one of the best mechanisms I've ever come across
302.916	is the victims of terrorism.
305.573	They are somebody who can actually stand there and say,
308.486	"""This product's crap. I had it and I was sick for days."
312.914	"It burnt my hand, whatever."" You believe them."
316.36	You can see their scars. You trust them.
319.003	But whether it's victims, whether it's governments,
324.268	NGOs, or even the Queen yesterday, in Northern Ireland,
329.973	we have to interact and engage with those different
334.075	layers of terrorism, and, in effect,
338.67	we do have to have a little dance with the devil.
342.717	This is my favorite part of my speech.
345.7	I wanted to blow you all up to try and make a point,
348.956	but — (Laughter) —
352.678	TED, for health and safety reasons, have told me
355.466	I've got to do a countdown, so
356.972	I feel like a bit of an Irish or Jewish terrorist,
360.27	sort of a health and safety terrorist, and I — (Laughter) —
365.684	I've got to count 3, 2, 1, and
368.993	it's a bit alarming, so thinking of what my motto would be,
372.32	"and it would be, ""Body parts, not heart attacks."""
375.078	So 3, 2, 1. (Explosion sound)
380.569	Very good. (Laughter)
385.516	Now, lady in 15J was a suicide bomber amongst us all.
393.325	We're all victims of terrorism.
395.45	There's 625 of us in this room. We're going to be scarred for life.
400.351	There was a father and a son who sat in that seat over there.
404.426	The son's dead. The father lives.
406.91	The father will probably kick himself for years to come
412.831	that he didn't take that seat instead of his kid.
417.07	He's going to take to alcohol, and he's probably
419.083	going to kill himself in three years. That's the stats.
423.443	There's a very young, attractive lady over here,
427.187	and she has something which I think's the worst form
430.215	of psychological, physical injury I've ever seen
433.011	out of a suicide bombing: It's human shrapnel.
436.707	What it means is, when she sat in a restaurant
438.86	in years to come, 10 years to come, 15 years to come,
441.865	or she's on the beach, every so often she's going to start
444.347	rubbing her skin, and out of there will come
447.32	a piece of that shrapnel.
449.554	And that is a hard thing for the head to take.
454.786	There's a lady over there as well who lost her legs
457.714	in this bombing.
461.226	She's going to find out that she gets a pitiful amount
465.31	of money off our government
469.417	for looking after what's happened to her.
472.709	She had a daughter who was going to go to one of the best
474.849	universities. She's going to give up university
477.55	to look after Mum.
481.279	We're all here, and all of those who watch it
483.811	are going to be traumatized by this event,
486.45	but all of you here who are victims are going to learn
489.598	some hard truths.
491.18	That is, our society, we sympathize, but after a while,
495.901	we start to ignore. We don't do enough as a society.
499.789	We do not look after our victims, and we do not enable them,
503.366	and what I'm going to try and show is that actually,
506.374	victims are the best weapon we have
509.158	against more terrorism.
512.334	How would the government at the turn of the millennium
516.55	approach today? Well, we all know.
518.775	What they'd have done then is an invasion.
521.379	If the suicide bomber was from Wales,
524.557	good luck to Wales, I'd say.
526.902	Knee-jerk legislation, emergency provision legislation --
530.654	which hits at the very basis of our society, as we all know --
534.353	it's a mistake.
537.526	We're going to drive prejudice throughout Edinburgh,
540.981	throughout the U.K., for Welsh people.
545.411	Today's approach, governments have learned from their mistakes.
551.056	They are looking at what I've started off on,
553.294	on these more asymmetrical approaches to it,
556.848	more modernist views, cause and effect.
559.55	But mistakes of the past are inevitable.
562.327	It's human nature.
563.827	The fear and the pressure to do something on them
567.563	is going to be immense. They are going to make mistakes.
569.843	They're not just going to be smart.
573.488	There was a famous Irish terrorist who once summed up
576.802	the point very beautifully. He said,
579.857	"""The thing is, about the British government, is, is that it's got"
581.969	"to be lucky all the time, and we only have to be lucky once."""
586.433	So what we need to do is we have to effect it.
589.673	We've got to start thinking about being more proactive.
592.429	We need to build an arsenal of noncombative weapons
597.117	in this war on terrorism.
598.738	But of course, it's ideas -- is not something that governments do very well.
607.186	I want to go back just to before the bang, to this idea of
611.365	brand, and I was talking about Coke and Pepsi, etc.
615.559	We see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war.
619.47	They'll see it as freedom fighters and truth
621.491	against injustice, imperialism, etc.
628.714	We do have to see this as a deadly battlefield.
632.705	It's not just [our] flesh and blood they want.
635.879	They actually want our cultural souls, and that's why
638.752	the brand analogy is a very interesting way of looking at this.
642.763	If we look at al Qaeda. Al Qaeda was essentially
647.343	a product on a shelf in a souk somewhere
651.883	which not many people had heard of.
654.022	9/11 launched it. It was its big marketing day,
658.186	and it was packaged for the 21st century. They knew what they were doing.
663.055	They were effectively [doing] something in this brand image
666.983	of creating a brand which can be franchised around
670.167	the world, where there's poverty, ignorance and injustice.
675.827	We, as I've said, have got to hit that market,
679.89	but we've got to use our heads rather than our might.
683.349	If we perceive it in this way as a brand, or other ways of thinking at it like this,
687.123	we will not resolve or counter terrorism.
691.562	What I'd like to do is just briefly go through a few examples
694.922	from my work on areas where we try and approach these things differently.
700.353	"The first one has been dubbed ""lawfare,"""
704.042	for want of a better word.
706.484	When we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists,
710.684	everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks
713.05	and crackpots. Now it's got a title. Everyone's doing it.
716.814	There's a bomb, people start suing.
718.427	But one of the first early cases on this was the Omagh Bombing.
722.118	A civil action was brought from 1998.
725.857	In Omagh, bomb went off, Real IRA,
729.265	middle of a peace process.
731.48	That meant that the culprits couldn't really be prosecuted
735.623	for lots of reasons, mostly to do with the peace process
738.871	and what was going on, the greater good.
741.088	It also meant, then, if you can imagine this,
743.583	that the people who bombed your children
745.886	and your husbands were walking around the supermarket
751.243	that you lived in.
752.927	Some of those victims said enough is enough.
756.689	We brought a private action, and thank God, 10 years later,
760.123	we actually won it. There is a slight appeal on
762.718	at the moment so I have to be a bit careful,
764.533	but I'm fairly confident.
766.65	Why was it effective?
768.269	It was effective not just because justice was seen to be done
770.906	where there was a huge void.
772.645	It was because the Real IRA and other terrorist groups,
777.271	their whole strength is from the fact that they are
779.35	an underdog. When we put the victims as the underdog
784.096	and flipped it, they didn't know what to do.
787.236	They were embarrassed. Their recruitment went down.
791.487	The bombs actually stopped -- fact -- because of this action.
795.775	We became, or those victims became, more importantly,
799.48	a ghost that haunted the terrorist organization.
803.456	There's other examples. We have a case called Almog
806.255	which is to do with a bank that was,
810.447	allegedly, from our point of view,
813.453	giving rewards to suicide bombers.
817.368	Just by bringing the very action,
820.376	that bank has stopped doing it, and indeed,
822.887	the powers that be around the world, which for real politic
825.291	reasons before, couldn't actually deal with this issue,
828.634	because there was lots of competing interests,
830.164	have actually closed down those loopholes in the banking system.
833.148	There's another case called the McDonald case,
835.863	where some victims of Semtex, of the Provisional IRA bombings,
840.185	which were supplied by Gaddafi, sued,
846.804	and that action has led to amazing things for new Libya.
851.741	New Libya has been compassionate towards those victims,
854.694	and started taking it -- so it started a whole new dialogue there.
858.326	But the problem is, we need more and more support
862.609	for these ideas and cases.
865.411	Civil affairs and civil society initiatives.
869.837	A good one is in Somalia. There's a war on piracy.
872.364	If anyone thinks you can have a war on piracy
874.17	like a war on terrorism and beat it, you're wrong.
876.796	What we're trying to do there is turn pirates to fisherman.
879.783	They used to be fisherman, of course,
882.007	but we stole their fish and dumped a load of toxic waste
885.203	in their water, so what we're trying to do is create
888.498	security and employment by bringing a coastguard
890.984	along with the fisheries industry, and I can guarantee you,
894.321	as that builds, al Shabaab and such likes will not have
897.185	the poverty and injustice any longer to prey on those people.
901.009	These initiatives cost less than a missile,
904.884	and certainly less than any soldier's life,
907.851	but more importantly, it takes the war to their homelands,
910.706	and not onto our shore,
913.004	and we're looking at the causes.
914.448	The last one I wanted to talk about was dialogue.
917.897	The advantages of dialogue are obvious.
920.703	It self-educates both sides, enables a better understanding,
925.005	reveals the strengths and weaknesses,
927.227	and yes, like some of the speakers before,
929.828	the shared vulnerability does lead to trust, and
933.717	it does then become, that process, part of normalization.
936.622	But it's not an easy road. After the bomb,
941.295	the victims are not into this.
944.424	There's practical problems.
946.318	It's politically risky for the protagonists
949.214	and for the interlocutors. On one occasion
951.949	I was doing it, every time I did a point that they didn't like,
954.39	they actually threw stones at me,
956.251	and when I did a point they liked,
958.238	they starting shooting in the air, equally not great. (Laughter)
962.833	Whatever the point, it gets to the heart of the problem,
966.035	you're doing it, you're talking to them.
968.151	Now, I just want to end with saying, if we follow reason,
971.894	we realize that I think we'd all say that we want to
977.256	have a perception of terrorism which is not just a pure
979.938	military perception of it.
983.706	We need to foster more
986.163	modern and asymmetrical responses to it.
988.948	This isn't about being soft on terrorism.
991.503	It's about fighting them on contemporary battlefields.
995.223	We must foster innovation, as I've said.
998.174	Governments are receptive. It won't come from those dusty corridors.
1002.046	The private sector has a role.
1004.259	The role we could do right now is going away
1006.832	and looking at how we can support victims around the world
1010.557	to bring initiatives.
1012.029	If I was to leave you with some big questions here which
1014.832	may change one's perception to it, and who knows what
1018.307	thoughts and responses will come out of it,
1020.686	but did myself and my terrorist group actually need
1024.641	to blow you up to make our point?
1027.877	We have to ask ourselves these questions, however unpalatable.
1032.259	Have we been ignoring an injustice or a humanitarian
1035.393	struggle somewhere in the world?
1038.158	What if, actually, engagement on poverty and injustice
1040.808	is exactly what the terrorists wanted us to do?
1043.223	What if the bombs are just simply wake-up calls for us?
1046.328	What happens if that bomb went off
1049.527	because we didn't have any thoughts and things in place
1052.834	to allow dialogue to deal with these things and interaction?
1057.513	What is definitely uncontroversial
1060.68	is that, as I've said, we've got to stop being reactive,
1062.487	and more proactive, and I just want to leave you
1066.104	with one idea, which is that
1069.512	it's a provocative question for you to think about,
1072.672	and the answer will require sympathy with the devil.
1076.793	It's a question that's been tackled by many great thinkers
1079.51	and writers: What if society actually needs crisis to change?
1084.427	What if society actually needs terrorism
1088.73	to change and adapt for the better?
1090.273	It's those Bulgakov themes, it's that picture of Jesus
1094.824	and the Devil hand in hand in Gethsemane
1098.028	walking into the moonlight.
1100.308	What it would mean is that humans,
1103.156	in order to survive in development,
1105.812	quite Darwinian spirit here,
1107.887	inherently must dance with the devil.
1112.217	A lot of people say that communism was defeated
1116.476	by the Rolling Stones. It's a good theory.
1120.47	Maybe the Rolling Stones has a place in this.
1123.306	Thank you.
1125.893	(Music) (Applause)
1134.763	Bruno Giussani: Thank you. (Applause)
