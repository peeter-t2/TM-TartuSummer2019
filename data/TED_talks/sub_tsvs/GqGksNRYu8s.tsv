12.76	Let's talk about trust.
16.24	We all know trust is fundamental,
19.76	but when it comes to trusting people,
22.4	something profound is happening.
25.8	Please raise your hand
27.08	if you have ever been
27.08	a host or a guest on Airbnb.
32.4	Wow. That's a lot of you.
35.64	Who owns Bitcoin?
38.64	Still a lot of you. OK.
39.92	And please raise your hand
39.92	if you've ever used Tinder
42.64	to help you find a mate.
44.28	(Laughter)
46.12	This one's really hard to count
46.12	because you're kind of going like this.
49.52	(Laughter)
51.36	These are all examples of how technology
54.16	is creating new mechanisms
56.28	that are enabling us to trust
56.28	unknown people, companies and ideas.
62.32	And yet at the same time,
64.36	trust in institutions --
65.92	banks, governments and even churches --
68.88	is collapsing.
70.28	So what's happening here,
72.52	and who do you trust?
74.8	Let's start in France with a platform --
74.8	with a company, I should say --
78.72	with a rather funny-sounding name,
80.88	BlaBlaCar.
82.16	It's a platform that matches
82.16	drivers and passengers
85.8	who want to share
85.8	long-distance journeys together.
89.84	The average ride taken is 320 kilometers.
94.08	So it's a good idea
94.08	to choose your fellow travelers wisely.
99.32	Social profiles and reviews
99.32	help people make a choice.
103.32	You can see if someone's a smoker,
103.32	you can see what kind of music they like,
108.36	you can see if they're going to bring
108.36	their dog along for the ride.
112.44	But it turns out
112.44	that the key social identifier
116.04	is how much you're going
116.04	to talk in the car.
118.68	(Laughter)
120.52	Bla, not a lot,
122.16	bla bla, you want a nice bit of chitchat,
124.48	and bla bla bla, you're not going
124.48	to stop talking the entire way
128.24	from London to Paris.
129.72	(Laughter)
132.04	It's remarkable, right,
132.04	that this idea works at all,
135.08	because it's counter to the lesson
135.08	most of us were taught as a child:
138.96	never get in a car with a stranger.
141.68	And yet, BlaBlaCar transports
141.68	more than four million people
146.84	every single month.
148.88	To put that in context,
148.88	that's more passengers
151.24	than the Eurostar
151.24	or JetBlue airlines carry.
155.36	BlaBlaCar is a beautiful illustration
155.36	of how technology is enabling
159.52	millions of people across the world
159.52	to take a trust leap.
163.56	A trust leap happens when we take the risk
163.56	to do something new or different
169.84	to the way that we've always done it.
172.44	Let's try to visualize this together.
175.36	OK. I want you to close your eyes.
179.32	There is a man staring at me
179.32	with his eyes wide open.
182.4	I'm on this big red circle. I can see.
184.88	So close your eyes.
186.32	(Laughter) (Applause)
189.2	I'll do it with you.
190.48	And I want you to imagine
190.48	there exists a gap
193.52	between you and something unknown.
196.76	That unknown can be
196.76	someone you've just met.
199.64	It can be a place you've never been to.
201.76	It can be something
201.76	you've never tried before.
205.16	You got it?
206.4	OK. You can open your eyes now.
208.52	For you to leap from a place of certainty,
211.88	to take a chance on that someone
211.88	or something unknown,
215.48	you need a force to pull you over the gap,
218.84	and that remarkable force is trust.
222.56	Trust is an elusive concept,
226.2	and yet we depend on it
226.2	for our lives to function.
229.6	I trust my children
231.88	when they say they're going
231.88	to turn the lights out at night.
234.76	I trusted the pilot
234.76	who flew me here to keep me safe.
238	It's a word we use a lot,
240.84	without always thinking
240.84	about what it really means
243.28	and how it works in different
243.28	contexts of our lives.
246.68	There are, in fact,
246.68	hundreds of definitions of trust,
250.32	and most can be reduced
250.32	to some kind of risk assessment
254.92	of how likely it is
254.92	that things will go right.
258.12	But I don't like this definition of trust,
260.72	because it makes trust
260.72	sound rational and predictable,
265.04	and it doesn't really get
265.04	to the human essence
267.64	of what it enables us to do
269.6	and how it empowers us
271.6	to connect with other people.
273.72	So I define trust a little differently.
275.8	I define trust as a confident
275.8	relationship to the unknown.
281.92	Now, when you view trust
281.92	through this lens,
284.04	it starts to explain
284.04	why it has the unique capacity
287.72	to enable us to cope with uncertainty,
290.84	to place our faith in strangers,
293.88	to keep moving forward.
296.4	Human beings are remarkable
299.2	at taking trust leaps.
301.4	Do you remember the first time
301.4	you put your credit card details
304.4	into a website?
305.64	That's a trust leap.
307	I distinctly remember telling my dad
309.96	that I wanted to buy a navy blue
309.96	secondhand Peugeot on eBay,
315.24	and he rightfully pointed out
316.92	that the seller's name
316.92	"was ""Invisible Wizard"""
319.32	and that this probably
319.32	was not such a good idea.
322.44	(Laughter)
324.16	So my work, my research
324.16	focuses on how technology
327.6	is transforming
327.6	the social glue of society,
330.28	trust between people,
331.96	and it's a fascinating area to study,
334.24	because there's still
334.24	so much we do not know.
337.64	For instance, do men and women
337.64	trust differently in digital environments?
342.76	Does the way we build trust
342.76	face-to-face translate online?
347.68	Does trust transfer?
349.64	So if you trust finding a mate on Tinder,
352.36	are you more likely
352.36	to trust finding a ride on BlaBlaCar?
356.44	But from studying hundreds
356.44	of networks and marketplaces,
359.72	there is a common pattern
359.72	that people follow,
362.56	"and I call it ""climbing the trust stack."""
365.24	Let me use BlaBlaCar
365.24	as an example to bring it to life.
369.08	On the first level,
370.4	you have to trust the idea.
372.6	So you have to trust
373.84	the idea of ride-sharing
373.84	is safe and worth trying.
377.64	The second level is about having
377.64	confidence in the platform,
382.36	that BlaBlaCar will help you
382.36	if something goes wrong.
386.52	And the third level is about
386.52	using little bits of information
390.2	to decide whether
390.2	the other person is trustworthy.
394.2	Now, the first time
394.2	we climb the trust stack,
396.84	it feels weird, even risky,
400.12	but we get to a point
400.12	where these ideas seem totally normal.
405.12	Our behaviors transform,
407.44	often relatively quickly.
409.44	In other words, trust enables
409.44	change and innovation.
415.28	So an idea that intrigued me,
415.28	and I'd like you to consider,
418.72	is whether we can better understand
421.28	major waves of disruption and change
421.28	in individuals in society
425.48	through the lens of trust.
427.56	Well, it turns out
427.56	that trust has only evolved
430.88	in three significant chapters
430.88	throughout the course of human history:
435.56	local, institutional
437.8	and what we're now entering, distributed.
440.68	So for a long time,
443.04	until the mid-1800s,
444.32	trust was built
444.32	around tight-knit relationships.
448.28	So say I lived in a village
450.32	with the first five rows of this audience,
452.92	and we all knew one another,
454.88	and say I wanted to borrow money.
457.8	The man who had his eyes wide open,
457.8	he might lend it to me,
460.8	and if I didn't pay him back,
462.92	you'd all know I was dodgy.
464.6	I would get a bad reputation,
466.28	and you would refuse
466.28	to do business with me in the future.
469.36	Trust was mostly local
469.36	and accountability-based.
473.6	In the mid-19th century,
474.96	society went through
474.96	a tremendous amount of change.
478.4	People moved to fast-growing cities
478.4	such as London and San Francisco,
482.2	and a local banker here
482.2	was replaced by large corporations
487.08	that didn't know us as individuals.
490	We started to place our trust
492	into black box systems of authority,
495.6	things like legal contracts
495.6	and regulation and insurance,
499.92	and less trust directly in other people.
503.96	Trust became institutional
503.96	and commission-based.
507.84	It's widely talked about how trust
507.84	in institutions and many corporate brands
512.68	has been steadily declining
512.68	and continues to do so.
516.44	I am constantly stunned
516.44	by major breaches of trust:
522.08	the News Corp phone hacking,
524.6	the Volkswagen emissions scandal,
527.44	the widespread abuse
527.44	in the Catholic Church,
530.799	the fact that only one measly banker
534.039	went to jail after the great
534.039	financial crisis,
537.36	or more recently the Panama Papers
539.44	that revealed how the rich
539.44	can exploit offshore tax regimes.
544.6	And the thing that really surprises me
547.08	is why do leaders find it so hard
551.12	to apologize, I mean sincerely apologize,
554.32	when our trust is broken?
557.36	It would be easy to conclude
557.36	that institutional trust isn't working
561.52	because we are fed up
563.04	with the sheer audacity
563.04	of dishonest elites,
565.96	but what's happening now
567.96	runs deeper than the rampant questioning
567.96	of the size and structure of institutions.
573.6	We're starting to realize
575.64	that institutional trust
577.44	wasn't designed for the digital age.
580.44	Conventions of how trust is built,
584.12	managed, lost and repaired --
586.48	in brands, leaders and entire systems --
589	is being turned upside down.
591.76	Now, this is exciting,
593.88	but it's frightening,
595.44	because it forces many of us
595.44	to have to rethink
598.16	how trust is built and destroyed
598.16	with our customers, with our employees,
602.88	even our loved ones.
605.8	The other day, I was talking to the CEO
605.8	of a leading international hotel brand,
612	and as is often the case,
612	we got onto the topic of Airbnb.
615.84	And he admitted to me
615.84	that he was perplexed by their success.
620.96	He was perplexed at how a company
623.12	that depends on the willingness
623.12	of strangers to trust one another
627.32	could work so well across 191 countries.
631.92	So I said to him
631.92	that I had a confession to make,
635.08	and he looked at me a bit strangely,
637.08	and I said --
638.48	and I'm sure many of you
638.48	do this as well --
640.52	I don't always bother to hang my towels up
643.04	when I'm finished in the hotel,
646	but I would never do this
646	as a guest on Airbnb.
649.56	And the reason why I would never do this
649.56	as a guest on Airbnb
652.92	is because guests know
652.92	that they'll be rated by hosts,
656.6	and that those ratings
656.6	are likely to impact their ability
660.36	to transact in the future.
662.68	It's a simple illustration of how
662.68	online trust will change our behaviors
666.92	in the real world,
668.24	make us more accountable
670.76	in ways we cannot yet even imagine.
674.88	I am not saying we do not need hotels
677.96	or traditional forms of authority.
680.32	But what we cannot deny
682.44	is that the way trust
682.44	flows through society is changing,
686.72	and it's creating this big shift
689.04	away from the 20th century
690.92	that was defined by institutional trust
693.76	towards the 21st century
696.28	that will be fueled by distributed trust.
699.48	Trust is no longer top-down.
703.68	It's being unbundled and inverted.
705.8	It's no longer opaque and linear.
709.16	A new recipe for trust is emerging
712.16	that once again
712.16	is distributed amongst people
716.08	and is accountability-based.
718.24	And this shift is only going to accelerate
721.68	with the emergence of the blockchain,
724.44	the innovative ledger technology
724.44	underpinning Bitcoin.
728.8	Now let's be honest,
731.76	getting our heads around
731.76	the way blockchain works
735.24	is mind-blowing.
737.72	And one of the reasons why
737.72	is it involves processing
741	some pretty complicated concepts
743.68	with terrible names.
745.2	I mean, cryptographic algorithms
745.2	and hash functions,
749.72	and people called miners,
749.72	who verify transactions --
752.8	all that was created
752.8	by this mysterious person
756.4	or persons called Satoshi Nakamoto.
759.16	Now, that is a massive trust leap
759.16	that hasn't happened yet.
764.84	(Applause)
767.92	But let's try to imagine this.
769.4	"So ""The Economist"""
769.4	eloquently described the blockchain
773.12	as the great chain
773.12	of being sure about things.
776.8	The easiest way I can describe it
776.8	is imagine the blocks as spreadsheets,
781.88	and they are filled with assets.
784.88	So that could be a property title.
787.32	It could be a stock trade.
789.36	It could be a creative asset,
789.36	such as the rights to a song.
792.96	Every time something moves
796	from one place on the register
796	to somewhere else,
799.84	that asset transfer is time-stamped
802.96	and publicly recorded on the blockchain.
806.4	It's that simple. Right.
808.72	So the real implication of the blockchain
811.84	is that it removes the need
811.84	for any kind of third party,
816	such as a lawyer,
817.36	or a trusted intermediary,
817.36	or maybe not a government intermediary
820.84	to facilitate the exchange.
822.68	So if we go back to the trust stack,
824.96	you still have to trust the idea,
827.72	you have to trust the platform,
830.04	but you don't have to trust
830.04	the other person
833	in the traditional sense.
834.96	The implications are huge.
837.48	In the same way the internet blew open
837.48	the doors to an age of information
841.2	available to everyone,
842.64	the blockchain will revolutionize
842.64	trust on a global scale.
848.24	Now, I've waited to the end
848.24	intentionally to mention Uber,
852.2	because I recognize
852.2	that it is a contentious
855.68	and widely overused example,
858.32	but in the context of a new era of trust,
858.32	it's a great case study.
861.92	Now, we will see cases of abuse
861.92	of distributed trust.
866.68	We've already seen this,
866.68	and it can go horribly wrong.
870.36	I am not surprised that we are seeing
870.36	protests from taxi associations
875.56	all around the world
876.92	trying to get governments to ban Uber
876.92	based on claims that it is unsafe.
882.32	I happened to be in London
882.32	the day that these protests took place,
886.72	and I happened to notice a tweet
888.72	from Matt Hancock, who is
888.72	a British minister for business.
892.36	And he wrote,
893.6	"""Does anyone have details of this"
893.6	#Uber app everyone's talking about?
897.6	(Laughter)
899.88	"I'd never heard of it until today."""
903.56	Now, the taxi associations,
907.8	they legitimized the first layer
907.8	of the trust stack.
910.56	They legitimized the idea
910.56	that they were trying to eliminate,
913.92	and sign-ups increased
913.92	by 850 percent in 24 hours.
919.08	Now, this is a really strong illustration
922.36	of how once a trust shift has happened
922.36	around a behavior or an entire sector,
928.2	you cannot reverse the story.
931.12	Every day, five million people
931.12	will take a trust leap
935	and ride with Uber.
936.56	In China, on Didi,
936.56	the ride-sharing platform,
942.72	That's 127 rides per second,
946.36	showing that this is
946.36	a cross-cultural phenomenon.
949.2	And the fascinating thing is
949.2	that both drivers and passengers report
953.4	that seeing a name
955.92	and seeing someone's photo
955.92	and their rating
958.92	makes them feel safer,
961.2	and as you may have experienced,
962.8	even behave a little more nicely
962.8	in the taxi cab.
967.36	Uber and Didi are early
967.36	but powerful examples
971.08	of how technology
971.08	is creating trust between people
975.08	in ways and on a scale
975.08	never possible before.
979.12	Today, many of us are comfortable
979.12	getting into cars driven by strangers.
985.2	We meet up with someone
985.2	we swiped right to be matched with.
989.52	We share our homes
989.52	with people we do not know.
993.48	This is just the beginning,
996.44	because the real disruption happening
999.04	isn't technological.
1001	It's the trust shift it creates,
1003.88	and for my part, I want to help people
1003.88	understand this new era of trust
1009	so that we can get it right
1010.68	and we can embrace
1010.68	the opportunities to redesign systems
1014.6	that are more transparent,
1014.6	inclusive and accountable.
1018.72	Thank you very much.
1020	(Applause)
1022.6	Thank you.
1023.84	(Applause)
