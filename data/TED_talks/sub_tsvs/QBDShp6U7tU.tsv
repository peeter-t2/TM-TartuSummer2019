13.057	Einstein said that
14.497	"""I never think about the future —"
14.497	"it comes soon enough."""
17.954	And he was right, of course.
19.655	So today, I'm here to ask you to think of
22.199	how the future is happening now.
25.059	Over the past 200 years, the world has experienced
27.822	two major waves of innovation.
29.752	First, the Industrial Revolution
31.981	brought us machines and factories, railways,
34.502	electricity, air travel,
36.832	and our lives have never been the same.
39.152	Then the Internet revolution
41.578	brought us computing power, data networks,
44.811	unprecedented access
47.146	to information and communication,
49.499	and our lives have never been the same.
52.774	Now we are experiencing
54.387	another metamorphic change:
56.151	the industrial Internet.
58.338	It brings together intelligent machines,
61.313	advanced analytics,
62.853	and the creativity of people at work.
65.219	It's the marriage of minds and machines.
68.419	And our lives will never be the same.
70.975	In my current role, I see up close
73.968	how technology is beginning to transform
76.801	industrial sectors that play a huge role
79.332	in our economy and in our lives:
81.725	energy, aviation, transportation, health care.
86.412	For an economist, this is highly unusual,
88.703	and it's extremely exciting,
90.242	because this is a transformation
92.131	as powerful as the Industrial Revolution and more,
96.153	and before the Industrial Revolution,
97.612	there was no economic growth to speak of.
100.562	So what is this industrial Internet?
103.917	Industrial machines are being equipped
105.78	with a growing number of electronic sensors
108.04	that allow them to see, hear, feel
111.489	a lot more than ever before,
113.195	generating prodigious amounts of data.
116.266	Increasingly sophisticated analytics
118.233	then sift through the data,
120.074	providing insights that allow us
122.83	to operate the machines in entirely new ways,
125.864	a lot more efficiently.
127.77	And not just individual machines,
129.759	but fleets of locomotives, airplanes,
132.544	entire systems like power grids, hospitals.
135.716	It is asset optimization and system optimization.
139.942	Of course, electronic sensors
141.952	have been around for some time,
143.657	but something has changed:
145.569	a sharp decline in the cost of sensors
148.42	and, thanks to advances in cloud computing,
150.897	a rapid decrease in the cost of storing
153.913	and processing data.
156.28	So we are moving to a world
157.99	where the machines we work with
159.783	are not just intelligent; they are brilliant.
164.024	They are self-aware, they are predictive,
166.782	reactive and social.
170.141	It's jet engines, locomotives, gas turbines,
174.099	medical devices, communicating seamlessly
176.88	with each other and with us.
179.205	It's a world where information itself
181.209	becomes intelligent and comes to us
183.396	automatically when we need it
185.325	without having to look for it.
188.523	We are beginning to deploy
190.05	throughout the industrial system
192.505	embedded virtualization,
194.55	multi-core processor technology,
196.752	advanced cloud-based communications,
200.192	a new software-defined machine infrastructure
202.934	which allows machine functionality
205.678	to become virtualized in software,
208.252	decoupling machine software from hardware,
211.414	and allowing us to remotely and automatically
215.021	monitor, manage and upgrade industrial assets.
220.345	Why does any of this matter at all?
223.479	Well first of all, it's already allowing us
225.95	to shift towards preventive,
228.151	condition-based maintenance,
230.029	which means fixing machines
231.991	just before they break,
234.279	without wasting time
236.295	servicing them on a fixed schedule.
238.623	And this, in turn, is pushing us towards
242.26	zero unplanned downtime,
244.115	which means there will be no more power outages,
246.98	no more flight delays.
249.02	So let me give you a few examples
250.664	of how these brilliant machines work,
252.543	and some of the examples may seem trivial,
254.841	some are clearly more profound,
256.837	but all of them are going to
256.837	have a very powerful impact.
260.962	Let's start with aviation.
262.916	Today, 10 percent of all flights
265.184	cancellations and delays
267.302	are due to unscheduled maintenance events.
270.003	Something goes wrong unexpectedly.
272.035	This results in eight billion dollars in costs
275.231	for the airline industry globally every year,
277.643	not to mention the impact on all of us:
279.945	stress, inconvenience,
282.03	missed meetings as we sit helplessly
284.925	in an airport terminal.
286.834	So how can the industrial Internet help here?
290.252	We've developed a preventive maintenance system
292.887	which can be installed on any aircraft.
294.877	It's self-learning and able to predict issues
298.128	that a human operator would miss.
301.084	The aircraft, while in flight,
303.438	will communicate with technicians on the ground.
305.788	By the time it lands, they will already know
307.748	if anything needs to be serviced.
310.234	Just in the U.S., a system like this can prevent
313.85	over 60,000 delays and cancellations every year,
317.557	helping seven million passengers
319.519	get to their destinations on time.
322.055	Or take healthcare.
323.708	Today, nurses spend an average
325.439	of 21 minutes per shift
328.082	looking for medical equipment.
329.775	That seems trivial, but it's less time spent
334.158	caring for patients.
336.867	St. Luke's Medical Center in Houston, Texas,
339.741	which has deployed industrial Internet technology
342.668	to electronically monitor and connect
344.733	patients, staff and medical equipment,
347.932	has reduced bed turnaround times
350.242	by nearly one hour.
351.977	If you need surgery, one hour matters.
354.787	It means more patients can be treated,
357.114	more lives can be saved.
359.104	Another medical center, in Washington state,
362.068	is piloting an application that allows
363.956	medical images from city scanners and MRIs
367.049	to be analyzed in the cloud,
369.164	developing better analytics
371.801	at a lower cost.
374.362	Imagine a patient
375.986	who has suffered a severe trauma,
377.42	and needs the attention of several specialists:
380.175	a neurologist, a cardiologist,
381.984	an orthopedic surgeon.
383.595	If all of them can have instantaneous
383.595	and simultaneous access
386.921	to scans and images as they are taken,
389.707	they will be able to deliver better healthcare faster.
394.405	So all of this translates into better health outcomes,
397.483	but it can also deliver substantial economic benefits.
400.923	Just a one-percent reduction in existing inefficiencies
404.409	could yield savings of over 60 billion dollars
407.915	to the healthcare industry worldwide,
410.712	and that is just a drop in the sea
413.071	compared to what we need to do to make healthcare
415.807	affordable on a sustainable basis.
418.228	Similar advances are happening in energy,
420.486	including renewable energy.
422.966	Wind farms equipped with new
422.966	remote monitorings and diagnostics
427.659	that allow wind turbines to talk to each other
430.254	and adjust the pitch of their
430.254	blades in a coordinated way,
434.103	depending on how the wind is blowing,
436.222	can now produce electricity at a cost
438.198	of less than five cents per kilowatt/hour.
441.376	Ten years ago, that cost was 30 cents,
443.393	six times as much.
445.345	The list goes on, and it will grow fast,
448.249	because industrial data are
448.249	now growing exponentially.
450.95	By 2020, they will account for over 50 percent
453.802	of all digital information.
456.03	But this is not just about data, so let me switch gears
459.209	and tell you how this is impacting already
462.05	the jobs we do every day,
463.493	because this new wave of innovation
465.214	is bringing about new tools and applications
468.33	that will allow us to collaborate
470.846	in a smarter and faster way,
472.416	making our jobs not just more efficient
475.549	but more rewarding.
477.338	Imagine a field engineer arriving at the wind farm
480.242	with a handheld device telling her
481.928	which turbines need servicing.
484.226	She already has all the spare parts,
485.704	because the problems were diagnosed in advanced.
488.246	And if she faces an unexpected issue,
490.72	the same handheld device will allow her to
493.323	communicate with colleagues at the service center,
495.831	let them see what she sees,
497.931	transmit data that they can run through diagnostics,
500.686	and they can stream videos that will guide her,
502.983	step by step, through whatever complex procedure
505.351	is needed to get the machines back up and running.
507.813	And their interaction gets documented
509.829	and stored in a searchable database.
514.246	Let's stop and think about this for a minute,
516.001	because this is a very important point.
517.722	This new wave of innovation is fundamentally
519.948	changing the way we work.
522.427	And I know that many of you will be concerned 
522.427	about the impact that innovation might have on jobs.
527.627	Unemployment is already high,
529.124	and there is always a fear 
529.124	that innovation will destroy jobs.
532.36	And innovation is disruptive.
534.491	But let me stress two things here.
536.944	First, we've already lived through
538.875	mechanization of agriculture,
538.875	automation of industry,
541.638	and employment has gone up,
543.663	because innovation is fundamentally about growth.
545.956	It makes products more affordable.
547.849	It creates new demand, new jobs.
550.509	Second, there is a concern that in the future,
553.091	there will only be room for engineers,
555.247	data scientists, and other highly-specialized workers.
558.267	And believe me, as an economist, I am also scared.
561.836	But think about it:
563.555	Just as a child can easily figure out
566.174	how to operate an iPad,
567.93	so a new generation of mobile and intuitive
570.055	industrial applications will make life easier
572.779	for workers of all skill levels.
575.198	The worker of the future will be more like Iron Man
578.4	"than the Charlie Chaplin of ""Modern Times."""
581.526	And to be sure, new high-skilled jobs will be created:
584.57	mechanical digital engineers who understand
586.446	both the machines and the data;
588.578	managers who understand their industry
590.861	and the analytics and can reorganize the business
593.722	to take full advantage of the technology.
596.844	But now let's take a step back.
599.16	Let's look at the big picture.
601.204	There are people who argue that today's innovation
603.627	is all about social media and silly games,
605.976	with nowhere near the transformational power
607.866	of the Industrial Revolution.
609.945	They say that all the growth-enhancing innovations
612.7	are behind us.
614.126	And every time I hear this, I can't help thinking that
617.44	even back in the Stone Age,
619.408	there must have been a group of cavemen
621.697	sitting around a fire one day
623.576	looking very grumpy,
625.102	and looking disapprovingly
625.102	at another group of cavemen
627.828	rolling a stone wheel up and down a hill,
629.997	and saying to each other,
631.806	"""Yeah, this wheel thing,"
634.087	cool toy, sure, but compared to fire,
636.878	it will have no impact.
638.994	"The big discoveries are all behind us."""
641.318	(Laughter)
643.205	This technological revolution
644.753	is as inspiring and transformational
647.281	as anything we have ever seen.
649.294	Human creativity and innovation
649.294	have always propelled us forward.
652.684	They've created jobs.
654.131	They've raised living standards.
655.52	They've made our lives
657.323	healthier and more rewarding.
659.383	And the new wave of innovation
660.626	which is beginning to sweep through industry
662.976	is no different.
664.598	In the U.S. alone, the industrial Internet
666.614	could raise average income by 25 to 40 percent
670.554	over the next 15 years,
672.246	boosting growth to rates we
672.246	haven't seen in a long time,
674.915	and adding between 10 and 15
674.915	trillion dollars to global GDP.
678.859	That is the size of the entire U.S. economy today.
683.112	But this is not a foregone conclusion.
685.623	We are just at the beginning of this transformation,
687.618	and there will be barriers to break,
689.474	obstacles to overcome.
691.16	We will need to invest in the new technologies.
693.701	We will need to adapt organizations
693.701	and managerial practices.
697.41	We will need a robust cybersecurity approach
700.304	that protects sensitive information
700.304	and intellectual property
704.047	and safeguards critical infrastructure
704.047	from cyberattacks.
707.287	And the education system will need to evolve
709.524	to ensure students are equipped with the right skills.
712.732	It's not going to be easy,
714.467	but it is going to be worth it.
717.114	The economic challenges facing us are hard,
720.662	but when I walk the factory floor,
722.758	and I see how humans and brilliant machines
725.346	are becoming interconnected,
727.064	and I see the difference this makes
729.138	in a hospital, in an airport,
731.704	in a power generation plant, I'm not just optimistic,
734.385	I'm enthusiastic.
735.993	This new technological revolution is upon us.
739.447	So think about the future —
739.447	it will be here soon enough.
742.641	Thank you.
745.326	(Applause)
