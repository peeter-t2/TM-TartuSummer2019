14.222	OK, first, some introductions.
17.919	My mom, Jennie, took this picture.
21.158	That's my dad, Frank, in the middle.
24.139	And on his left, my sisters:
26.766	Mary Catherine, Judith Ann,
26.766	Theresa Marie.
30.815	John Patrick's sitting on his lap
30.815	and Kevin Michael's on his right.
35.739	And in the pale-blue windbreaker,
38.236	Susan Diane. Me.
41.491	I loved growing up in a big family.
45.159	And one of my favorite things
45.159	was picking names.
49.924	But by the time child
49.924	number seven came along,
53.393	we had nearly run out of middle names.
57.075	It was a long deliberation
58.941	before we finally settled
58.941	on Jennifer Bridget.
64.353	Every parent in this audience
67.108	knows the joy and excitement
69.756	of picking a new baby's name.
72.913	And I was excited and thrilled
74.859	to help my mom in that special
74.859	ceremonial moment.
79.824	But it's not like that everywhere.
83.163	I travel a lot and I see a lot.
86.273	But it took me by surprise to learn
89.39	in an area of Ethiopia,
91.593	parents delay picking the names
91.593	for their new babies
95.298	by a month or more.
97.908	Why delay?
100.278	Why not take advantage
100.278	of this special ceremonial time?
104.423	Well, they delay because they're afraid.
108.007	They're afraid their baby will die.
111.08	And this loss might be a little more
111.08	bearable without a name.
117.248	A face without a name might help them feel
121.177	just a little less attached.
125.019	So here we are in one part of the world --
127.52	a time of joy, excitement,
127.52	dreaming of the future of that child --
132.893	while in another world,
135.179	parents are filled with dread,
138.123	not daring to dream
138.123	of a future for their child
141.722	beyond a few precious weeks.
144.789	How can that be?
147.189	How can it be that 2.6 million babies
152.698	die around the world
154.516	before they're even one month old?
157.926	2.6 million.
161.034	That's the population of Vancouver.
164.512	And the shocking thing is:
167.043	Why?
168.365	In too many cases, we simply don't know.
173.145	Now, I remember recently seeing
173.145	an updated pie chart.
177.295	And the pie chart was labeled,
179.487	"""Causes of death in children"
179.487	"under five worldwide."""
183.838	And there was a pretty big section
183.838	of that pie chart, about 40 percent --
192.077	"Now, ""neonatal"" is not a cause of death."
194.92	Neonatal is simply an adjective,
197.711	an adjective that means that the child
197.711	is less than one month old.
203.656	"For me, ""neonatal"" said:"
203.656	"""We have no idea."""
209.1	Now, I'm a scientist. I'm a doctor.
211.294	I want to fix things.
213.58	But you can't fix
213.58	what you can't define.
218.227	So our first step in restoring
218.227	the dreams of those parents
223.019	is to answer the question:
225.22	Why are babies dying?
228.359	So today, I want to talk
228.359	about a new approach,
232.118	an approach that I feel
234.079	will not only help us
234.079	know why babies are dying,
239.367	but is beginning to completely transform
242.768	the whole field of global health.
246.235	"It's called ""Precision Public Health."""
250.615	For me, precision medicine comes
250.615	from a very special place.
256.894	I trained as a cancer doctor,
256.894	an oncologist.
260.079	I got into it because I wanted
260.079	to help people feel better.
264.491	But too often my treatments
264.491	made them feel worse.
269.277	I still remember young women
269.277	being driven to my clinic
274.55	by their moms --
276.611	adults, who had to be helped
276.611	into my exam room by their mothers.
282.791	They were so weak
283.975	from the treatment I had given them.
287.283	But at the time, in those front lines
287.283	in the war on cancer,
291.507	we had few tools.
294.03	And the tools we did have
294.03	couldn't differentiate
297.746	between the cancer cells
297.746	that we wanted to hit hard
301.67	and those healthy cells
301.67	that we wanted to preserve.
306.663	And so the side effects that you're
306.663	all very familiar with --
309.642	hair loss, being sick to your stomach,
312.5	having a suppressed immune system,
312.5	so infection was a constant threat --
317.179	were always surrounding us.
320.985	And then I moved
320.985	to the biotechnology industry.
324.269	And I got to work on a new approach
324.269	for breast cancer patients
328.373	that could do a better job
328.373	of telling the healthy cells
333.398	from the unhealthy or cancer cells.
336.566	It's a drug called Herceptin.
339.343	And what Herceptin allowed us to do
342.603	is to precisely target
342.603	HER2-positive breast cancer,
349.036	at the time, the scariest
349.036	form of breast cancer.
352.091	And that precision let us
352.091	hit hard the cancer cells,
356.727	while sparing and being more
356.727	gentle on the normal cells.
362.441	A huge breakthrough.
364.181	It felt like a miracle,
367.091	so much so that today,
370.064	we're harnessing all those tools --
373.156	big data, consumer monitoring,
373.156	gene sequencing and more --
378.704	to tackle a broad variety of diseases.
383.044	That's allowing us to target individuals
388.137	with the right remedies at the right time.
392.731	Precision medicine
392.731	revolutionized cancer therapy.
397.655	Everything changed.
400.187	And I want everything to change again.
404.214	So I've been asking myself:
406.49	Why should we limit
408.332	this smarter, more precise,
408.332	better way to tackle diseases
413.165	to the rich world?
416.105	Now, don't misunderstand me --
417.641	I'm not talking about bringing
417.641	expensive medicines like Herceptin
420.991	to the developing world,
422.9	although I'd actually kind of like that.
425.707	What I am talking about
427.696	is moving from this precise
427.696	targeting for individuals
432.088	to tackle public health problems
434.755	in populations.
438.487	Now, OK, I know probably
438.487	"you're thinking, ""She's crazy."
443.094	"You can't do that. That's too ambitious."""
446.83	But here's the thing:
449.18	we're already doing this in a limited way,
452.502	and it's already starting
452.502	to make a big difference.
456.606	So here's what's happening.
458.952	Now, I told you I trained
458.952	as a cancer doctor.
461.566	But like many, many doctors
461.566	who trained in San Francisco in the '80s,
466.039	I also trained as an AIDS doctor.
469.077	It was a terrible time.
471.504	AIDS was a death sentence.
474.385	All my patients died.
477.329	Now, things are better,
479.257	but HIV/AIDS remains
479.257	a terrible global challenge.
484.473	Worldwide, about 17 million women
484.473	are living with HIV.
490.744	We know that when these women
490.744	become pregnant,
494.065	they can transfer the virus to their baby.
498.551	We also know in the absence of therapy,
500.827	half those babies will not survive
500.827	until the age of two.
505.446	But we know that antiretroviral therapy
505.446	can virtually guarantee
510.607	that she will not transmit
510.607	the virus to the baby.
513.86	So what do we do?
515.708	Well, a one-size-fits-all approach,
515.708	kind of like that blast of chemo,
520.294	would mean we test and treat
520.294	every pregnant woman in the world.
523.952	That would do the job.
525.889	But it's just not practical.
529.223	So instead, we target those areas
529.223	where HIV rates are the highest.
535.444	We know in certain countries
535.444	in sub-Saharan Africa
539.845	we can test and treat pregnant women
539.845	where rates are highest.
544.794	This precision approach
544.794	to a public health problem
547.976	has cut by nearly half
550.401	HIV transmission from mothers to baby
553.18	in the last five years.
555.485	(Applause)
560.945	Screening pregnant women
560.945	in certain areas in the developing world
566.031	is a powerful example
569.159	of how precision public health
569.159	can change things on a big scale.
576.452	So ...
578.213	How do we do that?
579.414	We can do that because we know.
581.896	We know who to target,
584.238	what to target,
585.949	where to target and how to target.
588.685	And that, for me, are the important 
588.685	elements of precision public health:
593.78	who, what, where and how.
597.814	But let's go back
597.814	to the 2.6 million babies
601.739	who die before they're one month old.
603.78	Here's the problem: we just don't know.
606.753	It may seem unbelievable,
609.241	but the way we figure out
609.241	the causes of infant mortality
614.128	in those countries
614.128	with the highest infant mortality
617.163	is a conversation with mom.
619.948	A health worker asks a mom
619.948	who has just lost her child,
624.35	"""Was the baby vomiting?"
624.35	"Did they have a fever?"""
628.043	And that conversation may take place
630.016	as long as three months
630.016	after the baby has died.
634.951	Now, put yourself
634.951	in the shoes of that mom.
639.239	It's a heartbreaking,
639.239	excruciating conversation.
643.833	And even worse -- it's not that helpful,
647.635	because we might know
647.635	there was a fever or vomiting,
650.612	but we don't know why.
653.171	So in the absence of knowing
653.171	that knowledge,
656.677	we cannot prevent that mom, that family,
659.683	or other families in that community
661.805	from suffering the same tragedy.
664.804	But what if we applied
664.804	a precision public health approach?
669.064	Let's say, for example,
670.482	we find out in certain areas of Africa
673.44	that babies are dying
673.44	because of a bacterial infection
677.21	transferred from the mother to the baby,
679.781	known as Group B streptococcus.
682.999	In the absence of treatment,
682.999	mom has a seven times higher chance
688.535	that her next baby will die.
692.124	Once we define the problem,
692.124	we can prevent that death
696.049	with something as cheap
696.049	and safe as penicillin.
701.894	We can do that because then we'll know.
705.034	And that's the point:
706.59	once we know, we can bring
706.59	the right interventions
710.05	to the right population
710.05	in the right places
713.613	to save lives.
716.973	With this approach,
716.973	and with these interventions
720.749	and others like them,
722.798	I have no doubt
724.533	that a precision public health approach
727.104	can help our world achieve
727.104	our 15-year goal.
731.423	And that would translate
731.423	into a million babies' lives saved
735.776	every single year.
738.253	One million babies every single year.
743.706	And why would we stop there?
746.319	A much more powerful approach
746.319	to public health --
749.64	imagine what might be possible.
752.912	Why couldn't we more effectively
752.912	tackle malnutrition?
757.643	Why wouldn't we prevent
757.643	cervical cancer in women?
762.832	And why not eradicate malaria?
765.674	(Applause)
766.699	Yes, clap for that!
767.936	(Applause)
771.888	So, you know, I live
771.888	in two different worlds,
774.755	one world populated by scientists,
778.59	and another world populated
778.59	by public health professionals.
783.319	The promise of precision public health
785.771	is to bring these two worlds together.
788.876	But you know, we all live in two worlds:
793.254	the rich world and the poor world.
797.76	And what I'm most excited about
797.76	about precision public health
801.634	is bridging these two worlds.
805.051	Every day in the rich world,
808.095	we're bringing incredible
808.095	talent and tools --
811.374	everything at our disposal --
813.357	to precisely target diseases
813.357	in ways I never imagined
818.294	would be possible.
820.152	Surely, we can tap into
820.152	that kind of talent and tools
825.192	to stop babies dying in the poor world.
829.201	If we did,
831.274	then every parent would have
831.274	the confidence
835.355	to name their child
835.355	the moment that child is born,
840.746	daring to dream that that child's life
840.746	will be measured in decades,
846.498	not days.
848.33	Thank you.
849.505	(Applause)
