25	You know, one of the intense pleasures of travel
28	and one of the delights of ethnographic research
30	is the opportunity to live amongst those
32	who have not forgotten the old ways,
34	who still feel their past in the wind,
37	touch it in stones polished by rain,
40	taste it in the bitter leaves of plants.
42	Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way,
46	or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning,
50	or that in the Himalaya,
53	the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma,
57	is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology,
60	and that is the idea that the world in which we live
63	does not exist in some absolute sense,
65	but is just one model of reality,
66	the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices
70	that our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations ago.
75	And of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives.
79	We're all born. We all bring our children into the world.
81	We go through initiation rites.
83	We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death,
85	so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing, we all dance,
89	we all have art.
91	But what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song,
94	the rhythm of the dance in every culture.
96	And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo,
99	or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti,
103	or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya,
109	the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes,
112	or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara --
117	this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with
119	a month ago --
120	or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma,
123	Everest, the goddess mother of the world.
125	All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being,
128	other ways of thinking,
129	other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth.
131	And this is an idea, if you think about it,
133	can only fill you with hope.
135	Now, together the myriad cultures of the world
138	make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life
142	that envelops the planet,
144	and is as important to the well-being of the planet
146	as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere.
149	And you might think of this cultural web of life
152	as being an ethnosphere,
153	and you might define the ethnosphere
155	as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths,
158	ideas, inspirations, intuitions brought into being
161	by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness.
165	The ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy.
168	It's the symbol of all that we are
170	and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species.
175	And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded,
178	so too is the ethnosphere
180	-- and, if anything, at a far greater rate.
182	No biologists, for example, would dare suggest
184	that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are
187	on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true,
189	and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario
191	in the realm of biological diversity --
194	scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario
197	in the realm of cultural diversity.
199	And the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss.
202	When each of you in this room were born,
205	there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet.
208	Now, a language is not just a body of vocabulary
211	or a set of grammatical rules.
213	A language is a flash of the human spirit.
215	It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture
218	comes into the material world.
219	Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind,
222	a watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
226	And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit here today in Monterey,
230	fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children.
234	They're no longer being taught to babies,
237	which means, effectively, unless something changes,
239	they're already dead.
240	What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence,
244	to be the last of your people to speak your language,
246	to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors
249	or anticipate the promise of the children?
252	And yet, that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody
255	somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks,
257	because every two weeks, some elder dies
259	and carries with him into the grave the last syllables
261	of an ancient tongue.
263	"And I know there's some of you who say, ""Well, wouldn't it be better,"
265	wouldn't the world be a better place
266	"if we all just spoke one language?"" And I say, ""Great,"
269	let's make that language Yoruba. Let's make it Cantonese.
272	"Let's make it Kogi."""
273	And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like
275	to be unable to speak your own language.
278	And so, what I'd like to do with you today
281	is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere,
285	a brief journey through the ethnosphere,
287	to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost.
292	Now, there are many of us who sort of forget
299	"that when I say ""different ways of being,"""
301	I really do mean different ways of being.
304	Take, for example, this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon,
309	the people of the anaconda
310	who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river
312	from the east in the belly of sacred snakes.
315	Now, this is a people who cognitively
318	do not distinguish the color blue from the color green
320	because the canopy of the heavens
322	is equated to the canopy of the forest
323	upon which the people depend.
325	They have a curious language and marriage rule
328	"which is called ""linguistic exogamy:"""
330	you must marry someone who speaks a different language.
333	And this is all rooted in the mythological past,
335	yet the curious thing is in these long houses,
337	where there are six or seven languages spoken
339	because of intermarriage,
341	you never hear anyone practicing a language.
344	They simply listen and then begin to speak.
347	Or, one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with,
349	the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador,
353	an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958.
356	In 1957, five missionaries attempted contact
360	and made a critical mistake.
361	They dropped from the air
362	8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves
364	in what we would say to be friendly gestures,
366	forgetting that these people of the rainforest
368	had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives.
371	They picked up these photographs from the forest floor,
373	tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure,
376	found nothing, and concluded that these were calling cards
378	from the devil, so they speared the five missionaries to death.
382	But the Waorani didn't just spear outsiders.
384	They speared each other.
388	We traced genealogies back eight generations,
391	and we found two instances of natural death
393	and when we pressured the people a little bit about it,
395	they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old
397	that he died getting old, so we speared him anyway. (Laughter)
401	But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge
404	of the forest that was astonishing.
405	Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces
408	and tell you what species left it behind.
411	In the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment
413	when I was asked by my professor at Harvard
415	if I was interested in going down to Haiti,
418	infiltrating the secret societies
420	which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength
422	and Tonton Macoutes,
423	and securing the poison used to make zombies.
426	In order to make sense out of sensation, of course,
429	I had to understand something about this remarkable faith
432	of Vodoun. And Voodoo is not a black magic cult.
435	On the contrary, it's a complex metaphysical worldview.
438	It's interesting.
439	If I asked you to name the great religions of the world,
440	what would you say?
441	Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever.
444	There's always one continent left out,
446	the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa
448	had no religious beliefs. Well, of course, they did
450	and Voodoo is simply the distillation
453	of these very profound religious ideas
454	that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era.
457	But, what makes Voodoo so interesting
459	is that it's this living relationship
461	between the living and the dead.
462	So, the living give birth to the spirits.
463	The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water,
466	responding to the rhythm of the dance
468	to momentarily displace the soul of the living,
470	so that for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god.
474	That's why the Voodooists like to say
476	"that ""You white people go to church and speak about God."
479	"We dance in the temple and become God."""
481	And because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit --
484	how can you be harmed?
485	So you see these astonishing demonstrations:
488	Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance
490	handling burning embers with impunity,
493	a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind
496	to affect the body that bears it
497	when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation.
501	Now, of all the peoples that I've ever been with,
503	the most extraordinary are the Kogi
505	of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia.
508	Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization
511	which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia,
514	in the wake of the conquest,
515	these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif
518	that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain.
520	In a bloodstained continent,
522	these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish.
525	To this day, they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood
528	but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary.
531	The young acolytes are taken away from their families
533	at the age of three and four,
535	sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness
537	in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years:
541	two nine-year periods
542	deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation
545	they spend in their natural mother's womb;
547	now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother.
550	And for this entire time,
552	they are inculturated into the values of their society,
555	values that maintain the proposition that their prayers
557	and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic --
560	or we might say the ecological -- balance.
563	And at the end of this amazing initiation,
564	one day they're suddenly taken out
566	and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18,
569	they see a sunrise. And in that crystal moment of awareness
573	of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes
576	of the stunningly beautiful landscape,
578	suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract
580	is affirmed in stunning glory. And the priest steps back
583	"and says, ""You see? It's really as I've told you."
585	"It is that beautiful. It is yours to protect."""
588	"They call themselves the ""elder brothers"""
590	and they say we, who are the younger brothers,
593	are the ones responsible for destroying the world.
597	Now, this level of intuition becomes very important.
599	Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape,
601	we either invoke Rousseau
603	"and the old canard of the ""noble savage,"""
606	which is an idea racist in its simplicity,
608	or alternatively, we invoke Thoreau
611	and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are.
613	Well, indigenous people are neither sentimental
615	nor weakened by nostalgia.
617	There's not a lot of room for either
619	in the malarial swamps of the Asmat
621	or in the chilling winds of Tibet, but they have, nevertheless,
624	through time and ritual, forged a traditional mystique of the Earth
628	that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it,
631	but on a far subtler intuition:
633	the idea that the Earth itself can only exist
637	because it is breathed into being by human consciousness.
639	Now, what does that mean?
641	It means that a young kid from the Andes
643	who's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit
645	that will direct his or her destiny
647	will be a profoundly different human being
650	and have a different relationship to that resource
653	or that place than a young kid from Montana
655	raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock
658	ready to be mined.
659	Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant.
663	What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship
666	between the individual and the natural world.
668	I was raised in the forests of British Columbia
670	to believe those forests existed to be cut.
672	That made me a different human being
674	than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth
676	who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw
678	and the Crooked Beak of Heaven
679	and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world,
682	spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation.
686	Now, if you begin to look at the idea
688	that these cultures could create different realities,
690	you could begin to understand
691	some of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here.
696	It's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April.
698	This is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about,
701	the most powerful psychoactive preparation
704	of the shaman's repertoire.
706	What makes ayahuasca fascinating
708	is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation,
712	but the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources:
716	on the one hand, this woody liana
718	which has in it a series of beta-carbolines,
720	harmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic --
723	to take the vine alone
725	is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke
727	drift across your consciousness --
729	but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family
732	called Psychotria viridis.
734	This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines,
737	very close to brain serotonin, dimethyltryptamine,
741	5-methoxydimethyltryptamine.
742	If you've ever seen the Yanomami
744	blowing that snuff up their noses,
746	that substance they make from a different set of species
749	also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine.
753	To have that powder blown up your nose
755	is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel
759	lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity. (Laughter)
766	It doesn't create the distortion of reality;
768	it creates the dissolution of reality.
769	In fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes --
772	who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era
774	with his discovery of the magic mushrooms
776	in Mexico in the 1930s --
778	I used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines
780	as hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects
783	there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination. (Laughter)
787	But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally
790	because they're denatured by an enzyme
792	found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase.
795	They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction
798	with some other chemical that denatures the MAO.
801	Now, the fascinating things
802	are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana
806	are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary
810	to potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question.
813	How, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants,
817	do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants
821	that when combined in this way,
822	created a kind of biochemical version
824	of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts?
826	"Well, we use that great euphemism, ""trial and error,"""
829	which is exposed to be meaningless.
831	"But you ask the Indians, and they say, ""The plants talk to us."""
834	Well, what does that mean?
835	This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayahuasca,
839	all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest,
843	all of which are referable to our eye as one species.
847	And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy
849	"and they say, ""I thought you knew something about plants."
852	"I mean, don't you know anything?"" And I said, ""No."""
854	Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties
857	in the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key.
860	Now, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard,
862	but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens. (Laughter)
866	Now --
867	(Applause) --
870	the problem -- the problem is that even those of us
872	sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people
874	view them as quaint and colorful
875	but somehow reduced to the margins of history
877	as the real world, meaning our world, moves on.
880	Well, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now,
882	is not going to be remembered for its wars
885	or its technological innovations,
886	but rather as the era in which we stood by
889	and either actively endorsed or passively accepted
891	the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity
894	on the planet. Now, the problem isn't change.
897	All cultures through all time
899	have constantly been engaged in a dance
902	with new possibilities of life.
904	And the problem is not technology itself.
907	The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux
909	when they gave up the bow and arrow
910	any more than an American stopped being an American
912	when he gave up the horse and buggy.
914	It's not change or technology
915	that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power,
919	the crude face of domination.
921	Wherever you look around the world,
923	you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away;
926	these are dynamic living peoples
928	being driven out of existence by identifiable forces
931	that are beyond their capacity to adapt to:
933	whether it's the egregious deforestation
936	in the homeland of the Penan --
938	a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak --
941	a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago,
945	and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution
948	on the banks of the rivers,
950	where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt
954	that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away
956	to the South China Sea,
957	where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon
959	ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest --
963	or, in the case of the Yanomami,
964	it's the disease entities that have come in,
966	in the wake of the discovery of gold.
968	Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet,
970	where I'm doing a lot of research recently,
973	you'll see it's a crude face of political domination.
976	You know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people
978	is universally condemned, but ethnocide,
981	the destruction of people's way of life, is not only not condemned,
984	it's universally, in many quarters, celebrated
987	as part of a development strategy.
989	And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet
992	until you move through it at the ground level.
994	I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China
998	overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa
1001	with a young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lhasa
1005	that I understood the face behind the statistics
1008	you hear about:
1009	6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes,
1013	1.2 million people killed by the cadres
1016	during the Cultural Revolution.
1018	This young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama.
1020	That meant he was instantly killed
1022	at the time of the Chinese invasion.
1024	His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora
1026	that took the people to Nepal.
1029	His mother was incarcerated
1031	for the crime of being wealthy.
1034	He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two
1036	to hide beneath her skirt tails
1038	because she couldn't bear to be without him.
1040	The sister who had done that brave deed
1042	was put into an education camp.
1043	One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband
1046	of Mao, and for that transgression,
1048	she was given seven years of hard labor.
1051	The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear,
1054	but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold.
1058	And in the end, then, it really comes down to a choice:
1061	do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony
1064	or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity?
1067	Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said, before she died,
1070	that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards
1073	this blandly amorphous generic world view
1075	not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination
1080	reduced to a more narrow modality of thought,
1084	but that we would wake from a dream one day
1085	having forgotten there were even other possibilities.
1089	And it's humbling to remember that our species has, perhaps,
1092	been around for [150,000] years.
1094	The Neolithic Revolution -- which gave us agriculture,
1097	at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed;
1099	the poetry of the shaman was displaced
1101	by the prose of the priesthood;
1102	we created hierarchy specialization surplus --
1105	is only 10,000 years ago.
1107	The modern industrial world as we know it
1109	is barely 300 years old.
1111	Now, that shallow history doesn't suggest to me
1113	that we have all the answers for all of the challenges
1116	that will confront us in the ensuing millennia.
1118	When these myriad cultures of the world
1120	are asked the meaning of being human,
1123	they respond with 10,000 different voices.
1125	And it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility
1131	of being what we are: a fully conscious species,
1134	fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens
1137	find a way to flourish. And there are great moments of optimism.
1143	This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island
1146	when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people,
1149	and this man, Olayuk, told me a marvelous story of his grandfather.
1153	The Canadian government has not always been kind
1155	to the Inuit people, and during the 1950s,
1157	to establish our sovereignty, we forced them into settlements.
1160	This old man's grandfather refused to go.
1164	The family, fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons,
1168	all of his tools.
1170	Now, you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold;
1172	they took advantage of it.
1173	The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish
1176	wrapped in caribou hide.
1177	So, this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night
1182	or the blizzard that was blowing.
1184	He simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers
1188	and defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze,
1191	he shaped it into the form of a blade.
1194	He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife
1196	and as it finally froze solid, he butchered a dog with it.
1199	He skinned the dog and improvised a harness,
1202	took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled,
1206	harnessed up an adjacent dog,
1207	and disappeared over the ice floes, shit knife in belt.
1211	Talk about getting by with nothing. (Laughter)
1215	And this, in many ways --
1216	(Applause) --
1218	is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people
1220	and of all indigenous people around the world.
1223	The Canadian government in April of 1999
1225	gave back to total control of the Inuit
1228	an area of land larger than California and Texas put together.
1231	It's our new homeland. It's called Nunavut.
1234	It's an independent territory. They control all mineral resources.
1237	An amazing example of how a nation-state
1239	can seek restitution with its people.
1244	And finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious
1247	at least to all of all us who've traveled
1248	in these remote reaches of the planet,
1252	to realize that they're not remote at all.
1253	They're homelands of somebody.
1255	They represent branches of the human imagination
1257	that go back to the dawn of time. And for all of us,
1261	the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children,
1264	become part of the naked geography of hope.
1267	So, what we're trying to do at the National Geographic, finally,
1271	is, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything.
1275	We think that polemics --
1276	(Applause) --
1278	we think that polemics are not persuasive,
1280	but we think that storytelling can change the world,
1283	and so we are probably the best storytelling institution
1286	in the world. We get 35 million hits on our website every month.
1293	Our magazines are read by millions.
1295	And what we're doing is a series of journeys
1298	to the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience
1300	to places of such cultural wonder
1303	that they cannot help but come away dazzled
1305	by what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore,
1307	embrace gradually, one by one,
1310	the central revelation of anthropology:
1312	that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way,
1316	that we can find a way to live
1317	in a truly multicultural, pluralistic world
1320	where all of the wisdom of all peoples
1322	can contribute to our collective well-being.
1325	Thank you very much.
1326	(Applause)
