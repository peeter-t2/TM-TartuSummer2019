12.874	So many of you have probably seen
12.874	"the movie ""The Martian."""
16.961	But for those of you who did not,
16.961	it's a movie about an astronaut
20.802	who is stranded on Mars,
20.802	and his efforts to stay alive
25.369	until the Earth can send a rescue mission
25.369	to bring him back to Earth.
31.025	Gladly, they do re-establish communication
34.188	with the character,
34.188	astronaut Watney, at some point
36.75	so that he's not as alone
36.75	on Mars until he can be rescued.
42.546	So while you're watching the movie,
42.546	or even if you haven't,
45.332	when you think about Mars,
46.904	you're probably thinking about
46.904	how far away it is and how distant.
51.728	And, what might not
51.728	have occurred to you is,
54.331	what are the logistics really like
54.331	of working on another planet --
58.252	of living on two planets
60.522	when there are people on the Earth
60.522	and there are rovers or people on Mars?
66.38	So think about when you have friends,
66.38	families and co-workers
70.562	in California, on the West Coast
70.562	or in other parts of the world.
74.045	When you're trying
74.045	to communicate with them,
76.122	one of the things
76.122	you probably first think about is:
78.584	wait, what time is it in California?
80.704	Will I wake them up? Is it OK to call?
83.703	So even if you're interacting
83.703	with colleagues who are in Europe,
87.078	you're immediately thinking about:
89.144	What does it take to coordinate
89.144	communication when people are far away?
96.793	So we don't have people on Mars
96.793	right now, but we do have rovers.
102.401	And actually right now, on Curiosity,
102.401	it is 6:10 in the morning.
107.53	So, 6:10 in the morning on Mars.
110.696	We have four rovers on Mars.
112.721	The United States has put four rovers
112.721	on Mars since the mid-1990s,
116.752	and I have been privileged enough
116.752	to work on three of them.
120.715	So, I am a spacecraft engineer,
120.715	a spacecraft operations engineer,
125.26	at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
125.26	in Los Angeles, California.
130.676	And these rovers
130.676	are our robotic emissaries.
134.861	So, they are our eyes and our ears,
134.861	and they see the planet for us
141.163	until we can send people.
143.02	So we learn how to operate
143.02	on other planets through these rovers.
148.337	So before we send people, we send robots.
153.146	So the reason there's a time difference
153.146	on Mars right now,
157.121	from the time that we're at
158.447	is because the Martian day
158.447	is longer than the Earth day.
162.774	Our Earth day is 24 hours,
165.595	because that's how long it takes
165.595	the Earth to rotate,
168.993	how long it takes to go around once.
171.018	So our day is 24 hours.
173.306	It takes Mars 24 hours and approximately
180.15	So that means that the Martian day
180.15	is 40 minutes longer than the Earth day.
187.027	So teams of people who are operating
187.027	the rovers on Mars, like this one,
192.206	what we are doing is we are living
192.206	on Earth, but working on Mars.
197.642	So we have to think as if we are actually
197.642	on Mars with the rover.
203.474	Our job, the job of this team,
203.474	of which I'm a part of,
207.077	is to send commands to the rover
207.077	to tell it what to do the next day.
213.03	To tell it to drive or drill
213.03	or tell her whatever she's supposed to do.
217.373	So while she's sleeping --
217.373	and the rover does sleep at night
221.863	because she needs
221.863	to recharge her batteries
224.257	and she needs to weather
224.257	the cold Martian night.
228.177	And so she sleeps.
229.563	So while she sleeps, we work
229.563	on her program for the next day.
234.677	So I work the Martian night shift.
237.683	(Laughter)
239.298	So in order to come to work on the Earth
239.298	at the same time every day on Mars --
245.95	like, let's say I need to be
245.95	at work at 5:00 p.m.,
248.378	this team needs to be at work
248.378	at 5:00 p.m. Mars time every day,
253.971	then we have to come to work
253.971	on the Earth 40 minutes later every day,
261.962	in order to stay in sync with Mars.
264.165	That's like moving a time zone every day.
267.141	So one day you come in at 8:00,
267.141	the next day 40 minutes later at 8:40,
272.62	the next day 40 minutes later at 9:20,
275.913	the next day at 10:00.
277.526	So you keep moving 40 minutes every day,
281.128	until soon you're coming to work
281.128	in the middle of the night --
284.141	the middle of the Earth night.
285.982	Right? So you can imagine
285.982	how confusing that is.
289.624	Hence, the Mars watch.
291.8	(Laughter)
292.825	This weights in this watch
292.825	have been mechanically adjusted
296.367	so that it runs more slowly.
298.919	Right? And we didn't start out --
300.832	I got this watch in 2004
303.082	when Spirit and Opportunity,
303.082	the rovers back then.
306.41	We didn't start out thinking
308.04	that we were going to need Mars watches.
310.495	Right? We thought, OK,
310.495	we'll just have the time on our computers
314.95	and on the mission control screens,
314.95	and that would be enough.
318.622	Yeah, not so much.
320.027	Because we weren't just
320.027	working on Mars time,
322.9	we were actually living on Mars time.
326.083	And we got just instantaneously confused
326.083	about what time it was.
330.39	So you really needed something
330.39	on your wrist to tell you:
334.207	What time is it on the Earth?
334.207	What time is it on Mars?
337.927	And it wasn't just the time on Mars
337.927	that was confusing;
343.845	we also needed to be able
343.845	to talk to each other about it.
349.157	"So a ""sol"" is a Martian day --"
349.157	again, 24 hours and 40 minutes.
354.808	So when we're talking about something
354.808	that's happening on the Earth,
358.027	we will say, today.
360.048	"So, for Mars, we say, ""tosol."""
362.904	(Laughter)
365.812	"Yesterday became ""yestersol"" for Mars."
370.657	Again, we didn't start out thinking,
370.657	"""Oh, let's invent a language."""
375.188	It was just very confusing.
376.502	I remember somebody
376.502	walked up to me and said,
378.707	"""I would like to do this activity"
378.707	"on the vehicle tomorrow, on the rover."""
382.164	"And I said, ""Tomorrow, tomorrow,"
382.164	"or Mars, tomorrow?"""
387.807	We started this terminology because
387.807	we needed a way to talk to each other.
392.883	(Laughter)
394.035	"Tomorrow became ""nextersol"" or ""solorrow."""
399.036	Because people have different preferences
399.036	for the words they use.
402.675	"Some of you might say ""soda"""
402.675	"and some of you might say ""pop."""
406.649	So we have people who say
406.649	"""nextersol"" or ""solorrow."""
410.382	And then something that I noticed after
410.382	a few years of working on these missions,
415.13	was that the people who work
415.13	"on the rovers, we say ""tosol."""
420.246	The people who work on the
420.246	landed missions that don't rove around,
423.804	"they say ""tosoul."""
425.778	So I could actually tell what mission
425.778	you worked on from your Martian accent.
430.521	(Laughter)
433.795	So we have the watches and the language,
433.795	and you're detecting a theme here, right?
437.679	So that we don't get confused.
440.239	But even the Earth daylight
440.239	could confuse us.
444.489	If you think that right now,
444.489	you've come to work
446.852	and it's the middle of the Martian night
448.971	and there's light streaming in
448.971	from the windows
452.293	that's going to be confusing as well.
454.901	So you can see from
454.901	this image of the control room
457.43	that all of the blinds are down.
459.723	So that there's no light to distract us.
462.75	The blinds went down all over the building
462.75	about a week before landing,
467.126	and they didn't go up
467.126	until we went off Mars time.
470.847	So this also works
470.847	for the house, for at home.
474.052	I've been on Mars time three times,
474.052	and my husband is like,
476.849	OK, we're getting ready for Mars time.
478.688	And so he'll put foil all over the windows
478.688	and dark curtains and shades
484.914	because it also affects your families.
488.085	And so here I was living in kind of
488.085	this darkened environment, but so was he.
493.525	And he'd gotten used to it.
494.845	But then I would get these plaintive
494.845	emails from him when he was at work.
499.077	Should I come home? Are you awake?
502.393	What time is it on Mars?
505.547	And I decided, OK,
505.547	so he needs a Mars watch.
508.069	(Laughter)
509.628	But of course, it's 2016,
509.628	so there's an app for that.
514.086	(Laughter)
515.388	So now instead of the watches,
515.388	we can also use our phones.
520.42	But the impact on families
520.42	was just across the board;
524.584	it wasn't just those of us
524.584	who were working on the rovers
528.27	but our families as well.
530.508	This is David Oh,
530.508	one of our flight directors,
533.011	and he's at the beach in Los Angeles
533.011	with his family at 1:00 in the morning.
537.509	(Laughter)
538.956	So because we landed in August
541.96	and his kids didn't have to go back
541.96	to school until September,
546.43	they actually went on to Mars time
546.43	with him for one month.
551.202	They got up 40 minutes later every day.
555.995	And they were on dad's work schedule.
558.202	So they lived on Mars time for a month
558.202	and had these great adventures,
562.201	like going bowling
562.201	in the middle of the night
564.322	or going to the beach.
565.969	And one of the things
565.969	that we all discovered
569.352	is you can get anywhere in Los Angeles
573.364	at 3:00 in the morning
573.364	when there's no traffic.
576.941	(Laughter)
578.439	So we would get off work,
579.655	and we didn't want to go home
579.655	and bother our families,
582.794	and we were hungry, so instead of
582.794	going locally to eat something,
586.008	"we'd go, ""Wait, there's this great"
586.008	all-night deli in Long Beach,
589.596	"and we can get there in 10 minutes!"""
591.862	So we would drive down --
591.862	it was like the 60s, no traffic.
594.607	We would drive down there,
594.607	and the restaurant owners would go,
598.386	"""Who are you people?"
601.241	And why are you at my restaurant
601.241	"at 3:00 in the morning?"""
605.778	So they came to realize
605.778	that there were these packs of Martians,
611.481	roaming the LA freeways,
611.481	in the middle of the night --
617.108	in the middle of the Earth night.
619.155	And we did actually
619.155	start calling ourselves Martians.
624.401	So those of us who were on Mars time
624.401	would refer to ourselves as Martians,
630.031	and everyone else as Earthlings.
632.908	(Laughter)
634.232	And that's because when you're moving
634.232	a time-zone every day,
639.951	you start to really feel separated
639.951	from everyone else.
645.788	You're literally in your own world.
650.524	So I have this button on that says,
650.524	"""I survived Mars time. Sol 0-90."""
657.473	And there's a picture of it
657.473	up on the screen.
660.242	So the reason we got these buttons
660.242	is because we work on Mars time
665.895	in order to be as efficient as possible
665.895	with the rover on Mars,
670.968	to make the best use of our time.
673.282	But we don't stay on Mars time
673.282	for more than three to four months.
677.192	Eventually, we'll move to a modified Mars
677.192	time, which is what we're working now.
682.199	And that's because it's hard on
682.199	your bodies, it's hard on your families.
686.88	In fact, there were sleep researchers
686.88	who actually were studying us
691.786	because it was so unusual for humans
691.786	to try to extend their day.
697.147	And they had about 30 of us
698.461	that they would do
698.461	sleep deprivation experiments on.
702.111	So I would come in and take the test
702.111	and I fell asleep in each one.
705.698	And that was because, again,
705.698	this eventually becomes hard on your body.
712.364	Even though it was a blast.
715.703	It was a huge bonding experience
715.703	with the other members on the team,
720.241	but it is difficult to sustain.
724.063	So these rover missions are our first
724.063	steps out into the solar system.
730.272	We are learning how to live
730.272	on more than one planet.
735.369	We are changing our perspective
735.369	to become multi-planetary.
740.763	So the next time you see
740.763	a Star Wars movie,
743.582	and there are people going
743.582	from the Dagobah system to Tatooine,
747.281	think about what it really means to have
747.281	people spread out so far.
752.795	What it means in terms
752.795	of the distances between them,
755.881	how they will start to feel
755.881	separate from each other
759.725	and just the logistics of the time.
763.757	We have not sent people
763.757	to Mars yet, but we hope to.
768.333	And between companies like SpaceX and NASA
772.196	and all of the international
772.196	space agencies of the world,
775.709	we hope to do that
775.709	in the next few decades.
779.5	So soon we will have people on Mars,
779.5	and we truly will be multi-planetary.
785.82	And the young boy or the young girl
788.256	who will be going to Mars could be
788.256	in this audience or listening today.
796.021	I have wanted to work at JPL
796.021	on these missions since I was 14 years old
801.647	and I am privileged to be a part of it.
803.893	And this is a remarkable time
803.893	in the space program,
807.971	and we are all in this journey together.
811.169	So the next time you think
811.169	you don't have enough time in your day,
816.404	just remember, it's all a matter
816.404	of your Earthly perspective.
821.206	Thank you.
822.381	(Applause)
