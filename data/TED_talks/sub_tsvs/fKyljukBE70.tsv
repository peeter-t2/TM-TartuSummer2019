15.26	I was offered a position
15.26	as associate professor of medicine
18.998	and chief of scientific visualization
21.83	at Yale University
23.831	in the department of medicine.
25.464	And my job was to write
25.464	many of the algorithms and code
28.26	for NASA to do virtual surgery
30.26	in preparation for the astronauts
30.26	going into deep-space flight,
33.26	so they could be kept in robotic pods.
35.26	One of the fascinating things
35.26	about what we were working on
38.19	is that we were seeing,
38.19	using new scanning technologies,
41.232	things that had never been seen before.
43.237	Not only in disease management,
44.835	but also things that allowed us
44.835	to see things about the body
48.26	that just made you marvel.
51.26	I remember one of the first times
51.26	we were looking at collagen.
54.26	And your entire body, everything --
56.26	your hair, skin, bone, nails --
58.26	everything is made of collagen.
60.26	And it's a kind of rope-like structure
60.26	that twirls and swirls like this.
65.212	And the only place that collagen
65.212	changes its structure
69.441	is in the cornea of your eye.
71.241	In your eye,
71.241	it becomes a grid formation,
74.64	and therefore, it becomes
74.64	transparent, as opposed to opaque.
77.971	So perfectly organized a structure,
80.26	it was hard not to attribute
80.26	divinity to it.
82.798	Because we kept on seeing this
82.798	in different parts of the body.
87.92	One of the opportunities I had
90.26	was one person was working
90.26	on a really interesting
92.665	micromagnetic resonance
92.665	imaging machine with the NIH.
95.26	And what we were going to do
97.26	was scan a new project
99.26	on the development of the fetus
99.26	from conception to birth
102.114	using these new technologies.
103.812	So I wrote the algorithms and code,
105.793	and he built the hardware --
105.793	Paul Lauterbur --
108.26	then went onto win the Nobel
108.26	Prize for inventing the MRI.
111.817	I got the data.
113.26	And I'm going to show you
113.26	a sample of the piece,
115.944	"""From Conception to Birth."""

357.101	Alexander Tsiaras: Thank you.
359.525	But as you can see,
360.826	when you actually start
360.826	working on this data,
363.027	it's pretty spectacular.
364.26	And as we kept on scanning more and more,
366.899	working on this project,
369.118	looking at these two simple cells
371.213	that have this unbelievable machinery
371.213	that will become the magic of you.
375.26	And as we kept on working on this data,
377.26	looking at small clusters of the body,
380.26	these little pieces of tissue
383.26	that were the trophoblasts
383.26	coming off of the blastocyst,
386.216	all of a sudden burrowing itself
386.216	into the side of the uterus,
389.202	"saying, ""I'm here to stay."""
390.56	Having conversation and communications
392.46	with the estrogens, the progesterones,
394.36	"saying, ""I'm here to stay, plant me,"""
397.04	building this incredible trilinear fetus
400.35	that becomes, within 44 days,
400.35	something that you can recognize,
403.46	and then at nine weeks
403.46	is really kind of a little human being.
407.26	The marvel of this information:
409.26	How do we actually have
409.26	this biological mechanism
412.652	inside our body
413.976	to actually see this information?
415.889	I'm going to show you
415.889	something pretty unique.
418.2	Here's a human heart at 25 days.
420.217	It's just basically two strands.
421.834	And like this magnificent origami,
423.56	cells are developing at one million cells
423.56	per second at four weeks,
428.26	as it's just folding on itself.
430.26	Within five weeks, you start to see
430.26	the early atrium and the early ventricles.
434.065	Six weeks, these folds are now beginning
436.309	with the papilla
436.309	on the inside of the heart
438.49	actually being able to pull down
438.49	each one of those valves in your heart
441.96	until you get a mature heart --
444.26	and then basically the development
444.26	of the entire human body.
447.173	The magic of the mechanisms
447.173	inside each genetic structure
451.26	saying exactly where
451.26	that nerve cell should go --
454.26	the complexity of these,
456.29	the mathematical models
456.29	of how these things are indeed done
459.211	are beyond human comprehension.
461.106	Even though I am a mathematician,
463.053	I look at this with marvel
464.992	of how do these instruction sets
464.992	not make these mistakes
469.26	as they build what is us?
471.26	It's a mystery, it's magic, it's divinity.
473.284	Then you start to take
473.284	a look at adult life.
476.26	Take a look at this
476.26	little tuft of capillaries.
478.523	It's just a tiny
478.523	sub-substructure, microscopic.
481.26	But basically by the time you're
481.26	nine months and you're given birth,
485.931	you have almost 60,000 miles
485.931	of vessels inside your body.
490.577	And only one mile is visible.
495.26	that are basically bringing
495.26	nutrients and taking waste away.
498.26	The complexity of building
498.26	that within a single system
500.945	is, again, beyond any comprehension
500.945	or any existing mathematics today.
504.854	And then instructions set,
506.26	from the brain to every other
506.26	part of the body --
509.069	look at the complexity of the folding.
510.947	Where does this intelligence
512.36	of knowing that a fold can
512.36	actually hold more information,
515.199	so as you actually watch
515.199	the baby's brain grow.
517.815	And this is one of the things we're doing.
519.983	We're launching two new studies
521.56	of scanning babies' brains
521.56	from the moment they're born.
524.357	Every six months
524.357	until they're six years old,
526.572	we're going to be doing
526.572	about 250 children,
529.26	watching exactly how the gyri
529.26	and the sulci of the brains fold
532.987	to see how this magnificent development
535.048	actually turns into memories
535.048	and the marvel that is us.
537.66	And it's not just our own existence,
539.46	but how does the woman's body understand
542.326	to have genetic structure
542.326	that not only builds her own,
545.031	but then has the understanding
546.56	that allows her to become
548.26	a walking immunological,
548.26	cardiovascular system
551.26	that basically is a mobile system
553.26	that can actually nurture,
555.119	treat this child with a kind of marvel
557.26	that is beyond, again,
557.26	our comprehension --
561.089	the magic that is existence, that is us?
564.298	Thank you.
565.46	(Applause)
