13.131	My first love was for the night sky.
16.432	Love is complicated.
17.998	You're looking at a fly-through of the 
17.998	Hubble Space Telescope Ultra-Deep Field,
22.527	one of the most distant images
22.527	of our universe ever observed.
26.639	Everything you see here is a galaxy,
29.153	comprised of billions of stars each.
32.16	And the farthest galaxy is 
32.16	a trillion, trillion kilometers away.
37.881	As an astrophysicist, I have
37.881	the awesome privilege of studying
40.805	some of the most exotic objects 
40.805	in our universe.
44.252	The objects that have captivated me 
44.252	from first crush throughout my career
48.064	are supermassive, 
48.064	hyperactive black holes.
53.813	Weighing one to 10 billion times 
53.813	the mass of our own sun,
57.931	these galactic black holes 
57.931	are devouring material,
60.825	at a rate of upwards of 
60.825	1,000 times more
64.145	"than your ""average"" "
64.145	supermassive black hole.
67.512	(Laughter)
69.64	These two characteristics,
71.334	with a few others, make them quasars.
74.548	At the same time, the objects I study
77.465	are producing some of the most
77.465	powerful particle streams
80.242	ever observed.
81.937	These narrow streams, called jets,
84.777	are moving at 99.99 percent 
84.777	of the speed of light,
89.385	and are pointed directly at the Earth.
93.368	These jetted, Earth-pointed, hyperactive
93.368	and supermassive black holes
99.257	are called blazars, or blazing quasars.
103.801	What makes blazars so special
103.801	is that they're some of the universe's
107.282	most efficient particle accelerators,
109.802	transporting incredible amounts
109.802	of energy throughout a galaxy.
114.72	Here, I'm showing an
114.72	artist's conception of a blazar.
117.469	The dinner plate by which 
117.469	material falls onto the black hole
120.669	is called the accretion disc,
122.256	shown here in blue.
124.082	Some of that material is slingshotted
124.082	around the black hole
127.061	and accelerated to insanely high speeds
129.085	in the jet, shown here in white.
131.912	Although the blazar system is rare,
134.599	the process by which nature
134.599	pulls in material via a disk,
137.606	and then flings some of it out via a jet,
137.606	is more common.
141.647	We'll eventually zoom out of 
141.647	the blazar system
144.091	to show its approximate relationship
144.091	to the larger galactic context.
153.89	Beyond the cosmic accounting
153.89	of what goes in to what goes out,
158.295	one of the hot topics in 
158.295	blazar astrophysics right now
161.342	is where the highest-energy 
161.342	jet emission comes from.
165.053	In this image, I'm interested
165.053	in where this white blob forms
168.974	and if, as a result, there's any 
168.974	relationship between the jet
172.617	and the accretion disc material.
175.483	Clear answers to this question
177.286	were almost completely
177.286	inaccessible until 2008,
180.401	when NASA launched a new telescope
180.401	that better detects gamma ray light --
184.675	that is, light with energies
184.675	a million times higher
187.387	than your standard x-ray scan.
190.934	I simultaneously compare variations
190.934	between the gamma ray light data
194.824	and the visible light data from
194.824	day to day and year to year,
198.493	to better localize these gamma ray blobs.
201.767	My research shows that in some instances,
204.453	these blobs form much closer
204.453	to the black hole
207.513	than we initially thought.
209.873	As we more confidently localize
211.764	where these gamma ray 
211.764	blobs are forming,
214.06	we can better understand how jets
214.06	are being accelerated,
217.583	and ultimately reveal 
217.583	the dynamic processes
220.191	by which some of the most fascinating
220.191	objects in our universe are formed.
225.892	This all started as a love story.
229.501	And it still is.
231.414	This love transformed me from 
231.414	a curious, stargazing young girl
235.624	to a professional astrophysicist,
237.445	hot on the heels of celestial discovery.
240.782	Who knew that chasing after the universe
243.202	would ground me so deeply
243.202	to my mission here on Earth.
247	Then again, when do we ever know
247	where love's first flutter
250.468	will truly take us.
251.942	Thank you.
253.171	(Applause)
