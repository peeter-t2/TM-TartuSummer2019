13	I read poetry all the time
15.462	and write about it frequently
17.022	and take poems apart
18.63	to see how they work
20.273	because I'm a word person.
21.98	I understand the world best, most fully,
24.757	in words rather than, say, pictures or numbers,
27.65	and when I have a new experience or a new feeling,
30.218	I'm a little frustrated
31.368	until I can try to put it into words.
34.563	I think I've always been that way.
36.874	I devoured science fiction as a child. I still do.
39.72	And I found poems by Andrew Marvell
42	and Matthew Arnold and Emily Dickinson
43.718	and William Butler Yeats
45.122	because they were quoted in science fiction,
47.402	and I loved their sounds
48.563	and I went on to read about ottava rima
51.97	and medial caesuras and enjambment
54.979	and all that other technical stuff
56.81	that you care about if you already care about poems,
60.93	because poems already made me happier
64.176	and sadder and more alive.
66.259	And I became a poetry critic
68.088	because I wanted to know how and why.
72.828	Now, poetry isn't one thing that serves one purpose
77.62	any more than music or computer programming
80.724	serve one purpose.
82.586	"The greek word poem, it just means ""a made thing,"""
86.554	and poetry is a set of techniques,
88.567	ways of making patterns
90.518	that put emotions into words.
92.607	The more techniques you know,
94.617	the more things you can make,
97.069	and the more patterns you can recognize
100.289	in things you might already like or love.
104.454	That said, poetry does seem to be
107.491	especially good at certain things.
110.425	For example, we are all going to die.
116.93	Poetry can help us live with that.
119.653	Poems are made of words, nothing but words.
122.226	The particulars in poems are like
124.618	the particularities, the personalities,
126.114	that distinguish people from one another.
129.391	Poems are easy to share, easy to pass on,
132.162	and when you read a poem, you can imagine
133.982	someone's speaking to you or for you,
137.99	maybe even someone far away
139.905	or someone made up or someone deceased.
144.337	That's why we can go to poems when we want to
148.782	remember something or someone,
151.22	to celebrate or to look beyond death
154.332	or to say goodbye,
156.192	and that's one reason poems can seem important,
160.012	even to people who aren't me,
162.035	who don't so much live in a world of words.
166.74	The poet Frank O'Hara said,
168.836	"""If you don't need poetry, bully for you,"""
172.09	but he also said when he didn't
172.09	want to be alive anymore,
175.722	the thought that he wouldn't write any more poems
178.232	had stopped him.
180.1	Poetry helps me want to be alive,
182.137	and I want to show you why by showing you how,
185.256	how a couple of poems react to the fact that
188.334	we're alive in one place at one time in one culture,
191.27	and in another we won't be alive at all.
196.646	So here's one of the first poems I memorized.
200.71	It could address a child or an adult.
205.2	"""From far, from eve and morning"
208.551	From yon twelve-winded sky,
211.377	The stuff of life to knit me
213.477	Blew hither; here am I.
215.647	Now — for a breath I tarry
217.913	Nor yet disperse apart —
220.033	Take my hand quick and tell me,
222.109	What have you in your heart.
224.212	Speak now, and I will answer;
226.669	How shall I help you, say;
229.249	Ere to the wind's twelve quarters
231.413	"I take my endless way."""
234.508	[A. E. Housman]
236.677	Now, this poem has appealed
238.121	to science fiction writers.
239.524	It's furnished at least three science fiction titles,
242.693	I think because it says poems can brings us news
245.421	from the future or the past
247.414	or across the world,
250.221	because their patterns can seem to tell you
252.926	what's in somebody's heart.
254.677	It says poems can bring people together temporarily,
257.549	which I think is true,
259.629	and it sticks in my head not just because it rhymes
263.166	but for how it rhymes,
264.604	cleanly and simply on the two and four,
266.991	"""say"" and ""way,"""
268.228	with anticipatory hints on the one and three,
271.035	"""answer"" and ""quarters,"""
272.66	as if the poem itself were coming together.
276.535	It plays up the fact that we die
278.547	by exaggerating the speed of our lives.
280.85	A few years on Earth become
283.128	one speech, one breath.
285.367	It's a poem about loneliness --
287.526	"the ""I"" in the poem feels no connection will last —"
290.629	and it might look like a plea for help
292.541	"'til you get to the word ""help,"""
295.051	"where this ""I"" facing you, taking your hand,"
297.593	is more like a teacher or a genie,
299.574	or at least that's what he wants to believe.
302.298	It would not be the first time a poet had
305.413	written the poem that he wanted to hear.
310.275	Now, this next poem really changed
313.018	what I liked and what I read
315.014	and what I felt I could read as an adult.
317.373	It might not make any sense to you
319.012	if you haven't seen it before.
322.942	"""The Garden"""
325.15	"""Oleander: coral"
327.541	from lipstick ads in the 50's.
330.101	Fruit of the tree of such knowledge
333.069	To smack
333.069	(thin air)
335.013	meaning kiss or hit.
337.111	It appears
338.23	in the guise of outworn usages
340.249	because we are bad?
343.12	Big masculine threat,
344.957	"insinuating and slangy."""
347.507	[Rae Armantrout]
349.705	Now, I found this poem in an anthology
352.453	of almost equally confusing poems in 1989.
355.275	I just heard that there were these scandalous writers
357.293	called Language poets who didn't make any sense,
359.92	and I wanted to go and see
359.92	for myself what they were like,
362.188	and some of them didn't do much for me,
363.878	but this writer, Rae Armantrout,
365.43	did an awful lot, and I kept reading her
368.037	until I felt I knew what was going on,
371.228	as I do with this poem.
372.493	It's about the Garden of Eden and the Fall
375.614	and the Biblical story of the Fall,
379.17	in which sex as we know it
381.322	and death and guilt
382.6	come into the world at the same time.
384.609	It's also about how appearances deceive,
386.818	how our culture can sweep us along
389.242	into doing and saying things we didn't intend
391.61	or don't like, and Armantrout's style
394.08	is trying to help us stop or slow down.
397.518	"""Smack"" can mean ""kiss"" as in air kisses,"
401.952	as in lip-smacking,
402.917	"but that can lead to ""smack"" as in ""hit"""
405.279	as in domestic abuse,
407.394	because sexual attraction can seem threatening.
411.202	The red that means fertility
413.468	can also mean poison.
415.17	Oleander is poisonous.
416.263	"And outworn usages like ""smack"" for ""kiss"""
419.95	"or ""hit"" can help us see"
422.607	how our unacknowledged assumptions
424.925	can make us believe we are bad,
426.92	either because sex is sinful
428.962	or because we tolerate so much sexism.
431.802	We let guys tell women what to do.
434.898	The poem reacts to old lipstick ads,
437.511	and its edginess about statement,
439.572	its reversals and halts, have everything to do
441.894	with resisting the language of ads
444.115	that want to tell us so easily what to want,
447.323	what to do, what to think.
448.723	That resistance is a lot of the point of the poem,
451.267	which shows me, Armantrout shows me
453.435	what it's like to hear grave threats
455.401	and mortal dishonesty in the language
457.949	of everyday life, and once she's done that,
460.516	I think she can show other people, women and men,
464.976	what it's like to feel that way
466.451	and say to other people, women and men
469.157	who feel so alienated or so threatened
472.07	that they're not alone.
474.011	Now, how do I know that I'm right
477.479	about this somewhat confusing poem?
479.457	Well in this case, I emailed
479.457	the poet a draft of my talk
482.198	"and she said, ""Yeah, yeah, that's about it."""
485.034	Yeah. (Laughter) (Applause)
488.949	But usually, you can't know. You never know.
491.875	You can't be sure, and that's okay.
494.429	All we can do we is listen to poems
496.03	and look at poems and guess
497.689	and see if they can bring us what we need,
500.171	and if you're wrong about some part of a poem,
503.14	nothing bad will happen.
507.071	Now, this next poem is older than Armantrout's,
509.854	but a little younger than A. E. Housman's.
513.618	"""The Brave Man"""
515.486	"""The sun, that brave man,"
518.17	Comes through boughs that lie in wait,
520.89	That brave man.
523.315	Green and gloomy eyes
524.9	In dark forms of the grass
526.728	Run away.
528.245	The good stars,
529.97	Pale helms and spiky spurs,
532.657	Run away.
534.047	Fears of my bed,
535.402	Fears of life and fears of death,
537.88	Run away.
539.36	That brave man comes up
541.656	From below and walks without meditation,
544.576	"That brave man."""
546.353	[Wallace Stevens]
549.343	Now, the sun in this poem,
551.696	in Wallace Stevens' poem, seems so grave
554.185	because the person in the poem is so afraid.
557.656	The sun comes up in the morning through branches,
560.143	dispels the dew, the eyes, on the grass,
563.082	and defeats stars envisioned as armies.
566.487	"""Brave"" has its old sense of showy"
568.456	as well as its modern sense, courage.
570.7	This sun is not afraid to show his face.
574.04	But the person in the poem is afraid.
577.392	He might have been up all night.
578.931	That is the reveal Stevens
578.931	saves for that fourth stanza,
582.913	where run away has become a refrain.
585.691	This person might want to run away too,
587.883	but fortified by the sun's example,
590.173	he might just rise.
592.898	"Stevens saves that sonically odd word ""meditation"""
597.176	for the end.
598.85	Unlike the sun, human beings think.
601.751	We meditate on past and future, life and death,
605.848	above and below.
608.394	And it can make us afraid.
612.178	Poems, the patterns in poems,
614.248	show us not just what somebody thought
616.19	or what someone did or what happened
617.862	but what it was like to be a person like that,
622.658	to be so anxious, so lonely, so inquisitive,
626.348	so goofy, so preposterous, so brave.
632.234	That's why poems can seem at once so durable,
635.88	so personal, and so ephemeral,
637.921	like something inside and outside you at once.
641.048	The Scottish poet Denise Riley compares poetry
644.383	to a needle, a sliver of outside I cradle inside,
648.501	and the American poet Terrance Hayes
650.909	"wrote six poems called ""Wind in a Box."""
653.992	"One of them asks, ""Tell me,"
655.428	"what am I going to do when I'm dead?"""
658.062	And the answer is that he'll stay with us
660.792	or won't stay with us inside us as wind,
663.668	as air, as words.
666.89	It is easier than ever to find poems
669.548	that might stay inside you, that might stay with you,
673.14	from long, long ago, or from right this minute,
675.598	from far away or from right close to where you live,
678.172	almost no matter where you live.
681.498	Poems can help you say, help
681.498	you show how you're feeling,
684.967	but they can also introduce you
687.407	to feelings, ways of being in the world,
689.69	people, very much unlike you,
692.067	maybe even people from long, long ago.
696.648	Some poems even tell you
698.735	that that is what they can do.
703.286	That's what John Keats is doing
705.956	in his most mysterious, perhaps, poem.
710.324	It's mysterious because it's probably unfinished,
714.236	he probably left it unfinished,
716.565	and because it might be meant
718.162	for a character in a play,
720.788	but it might just be Keats' thinking
722.465	about what his own writing,
724.1	his handwriting, could do,
726.3	and in it I hear, at least I hear, mortality,
730.19	and I hear the power of older poetic techniques,
733.719	and I have the feeling, you might have the feeling,
736.25	of meeting even for an instant, almost becoming,
739.236	someone else from long ago,
740.758	someone quite memorable.
743.473	"""This living hand, now warm and capable"
746.649	Of earnest grasping, would, if it were cold
750.359	And in the icy silence of the tomb,
752.75	So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights
756.326	That thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood
760.26	So in my veins red life might stream again,
763.911	And thou be conscience-calm’d -- see here it is --
768.81	"I hold it towards you."""
773.11	Thanks.
775.417	(Applause)
