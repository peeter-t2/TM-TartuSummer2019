13.309	I'll never forget the sound
15.525	of laughing with my friends.
19	I'll never forget the sound
20.82	of my mother's voice
20.82	right before I fell asleep.
26.426	And I'll never forget
26.426	the comforting sound of water
30.713	trickling down a stream.
34.593	Imagine my fear, pure fear,
38.622	when, at the age of 10,
40.992	I was told I was going to lose my hearing.
45.386	And over the next five years,
47.474	it progressed until I was classified
47.474	as profoundly deaf.
54.35	But I believe that losing my hearing
57.709	was one of the greatest gifts
57.709	I've ever received.
62.278	You see, I get to experience
62.278	the world in a unique way.
66.901	And I believe that
66.901	these unique experiences
70.953	that people with disabilities have
73.364	is what's going to help us
73.364	make and design a better world
78.408	for everyone -- both for people
78.408	with and without disabilities.
85.393	I used to be a disability rights lawyer,
87.443	and I spent a lot of my time
87.443	focused on enforcing the law,
91.117	ensuring that accommodations were made.
93.998	And then I had to quickly
93.998	learn international policy,
98.384	because I was asked to work
98.384	on the UN Convention
102.29	that protects people with disabilities.
105.49	As the leader of the NGO there,
108.415	I spent most of my energy
108.415	trying to convince people
113.097	about the capabilities
113.097	of people with disabilities.
117.775	But somewhere along the way,
120.916	and after many career transitions
123.111	that my parents weren't so happy about --
125.182	(Laughter)
126.792	I stumbled upon a solution
129.923	that I believe may be
129.923	an even more powerful tool
135.307	to solve some of the world's
135.307	greatest problems,
138.641	disability or not.
142.207	And that tool is called design thinking.
147.853	Design thinking is a process
147.853	for innovation and problem solving.
153.773	There are five steps.
155.573	The first is defining the problem
158.821	and understanding its constraints.
161.451	The second is observing people
161.451	in real-life situations
166.521	and empathizing with them.
168.845	Third, throwing out hundreds of ideas --
168.845	the more the better,
172.839	the wilder the better.
175.186	Fourth, prototyping:
175.186	gathering whatever you can,
179.744	whatever you can find,
181.22	to mimic your solution, to test it
183.843	and to refine it.
185.968	And finally, implementation:
188.433	ensuring that the solution
188.433	you came up with is sustainable.
195.007	Warren Berger says that design thinking
195.007	teaches us to look sideways,
201.599	to reframe, to refine, to experiment
205.623	and, probably most importantly,
207.994	ask those stupid questions.
211.601	Design thinkers believe
211.601	that everyone is creative.
216.71	They believe in bringing people
216.71	from multiple disciplines together,
221.452	because they want to share
221.452	multiple perspectives
224.691	and bring them together
224.691	and ultimately merge them
227.131	to form something new.
231.919	Design thinking is such a successful
231.919	and versatile tool
235.634	that it has been applied
235.634	in almost every industry.
240.586	I saw the potential that it had
240.586	for the issues I faced,
244.985	so I decided to go back to school
248.241	and get my master's in social design.
251.832	This looks at how to use design
251.832	to create positive change in the world.
258.209	While I was there,
259.654	I fell in love with woodworking.
262.217	But what I quickly realized
264.938	was that I was missing out on something.
268.058	As you're working with a tool,
271.021	right before it's about
271.021	to kick back at you --
273.474	which means the piece or the tool
273.474	jumps back at you --
276.757	it makes a sound.
278.992	And I couldn't hear this sound.
281.313	So I decided,
283.873	why not try and solve it?
286.363	My solution was a pair of safety glasses
289.871	that were engineered
289.871	to visually alert the user
293.687	to pitch changes in the tool,
296.303	before the human ear could pick it up.
300.802	Why hadn't tool designers
300.802	thought of this before?
304.692	(Laughter)
306.619	Two reasons: one, I was a beginner.
310.856	I wasn't weighed down by expertise
310.856	or conventional wisdom.
316.284	The second is: I was Deaf.
320.07	My unique experience of the world
320.07	helped inform my solution.
325.886	And as I went on, I kept running into
325.886	more and more solutions
329.863	that were originally made
329.863	for people with disabilities,
333.459	and that ended up being picked up,
336.789	embraced and loved by the mainstream,
339.735	disability or not.
341.448	This is an OXO potato peeler.
343.886	It was originally designed
343.886	for people with arthritis,
347.532	but it was so comfortable,
347.532	everybody loved it.
351.792	Text messaging: that was originally
351.792	designed for people who are Deaf.
356.817	And as you know,
356.817	everybody loves that, too.
359.091	(Laughter)
361.033	I started thinking:
363.492	What if we changed our mindset?
367.578	What if we started designing
367.578	for disability first --
372.73	not the norm?
374.721	As you see, when we design
374.721	for disability first,
378.535	we often stumble upon
378.535	solutions that are not only inclusive,
384.09	but also are often better
384.09	than when we design for the norm.
390.398	And this excites me,
391.977	because this means that the energy
391.977	it takes to accommodate someone
398.325	with a disability
399.95	can be leveraged, molded and played with
404.837	as a force for creativity and innovation.
409.712	This moves us from the mindset
409.712	of trying to change the hearts
415.269	and the deficiency mindset of tolerance,
418.416	to becoming an alchemist,
421.158	the type of magician that this world
421.158	so desperately needs
425.152	to solve some of its greatest problems.
428.86	Now, I also believe
430.918	that people with disabilities
430.918	have great potential to be designers
435.461	within this design-thinking process.
438.36	Without knowing it, from a very early age,
441.367	I've been a design thinker,
441.367	fine-tuning my skills.
445.621	Design thinkers are, by nature,
445.621	problem solvers.
451.58	So imagine listening to a conversation
455.909	and only understanding
461.64	You can't ask them to repeat
461.64	every single word.
464.911	They would just get frustrated with you.
467.5	So without even realizing it,
470.264	my solution was to take
470.264	the muffled sound I heard,
475.2	that was the beat,
476.376	and turn it into a rhythm
476.376	and place it with the lips I read.
481.908	Years later, someone commented
481.908	that my writing had a rhythm to it.
488.105	Well, this is because I experience
488.105	conversations as rhythms.
494.369	I also became really,
494.369	really good at failing.
499.468	(Laughter)
500.726	Quite literally.
502.801	My first semester in Spanish, I got a D.
506.569	But what I learned
506.569	was that when I picked myself up
510.407	and changed a few things around,
512.731	eventually, I succeeded.
517.187	Similarly, design thinking
517.187	encourages people to fail
521.831	and fail often,
523.491	because eventually, you will succeed.
527.404	Very few great innovations in this world
531.308	have come from someone succeeding
531.308	on the first try.
536.906	I also experienced this lesson in sports.
541.46	I'll never forget my coach
541.46	saying to my mom,
545.389	"""If she just didn't have her hearing loss,"
548.647	"she would be on the national team."""
552.061	But what my coach, and what I
552.061	didn't even know at the time,
557.019	was that my hearing loss
557.019	actually helped me excel at sports.
562.704	You see, when you lose your hearing,
562.704	not only do you adapt your behavior,
568.441	but you also adapt your physical senses.
572.785	One example of this
574.459	is that my visual
574.459	attention span increased.
579.543	Imagine a soccer player,
579.543	coming down the left flank.
584.025	Imagine being goalkeeper, like I was,
586.852	and the ball is coming
586.852	down the left flank.
589.024	A person with normal hearing
589.024	would have the visual perspective of this.
594.872	I had the benefit of a spectrum this wide.
598.887	So I picked up the players over here,
601.348	that were moving about
601.348	and coming down the field.
603.886	And I picked them up quicker,
603.886	so that if the ball was passed,
607.584	I could reposition myself
607.584	and be ready for that shot.
612.955	So as you can see,
614.496	I've been a design thinker
614.496	for nearly all my life.
618.788	My observation skills have been honed
618.788	so that I pick up on things
623.37	that others would never pick up on.
627.233	My constant need to adapt
627.233	has made me a great ideator
631.221	and problem solver.
633.392	And I've often had to do this
633.392	within limitations and constraints.
638.164	This is something that designers
638.164	also have to deal with frequently.
644.638	My work most recently took me to Haiti.
648.049	Design thinkers often seek out
648.049	extreme situations,
652.262	because that often informs
652.262	some of their best designs.
656.541	And Haiti -- it was like a perfect storm.
660.415	I lived and worked
660.415	with 300 Deaf individuals
665.656	that were relocated
665.656	after the 2010 earthquake.
669.805	But five and a half years later,
673.566	there still was no electricity;
675.722	there still was no safe drinking water;
678.232	there were still no job opportunities;
681.12	there was still rampant crime,
681.12	and it went unpunished.
685.069	International aid organizations
685.069	came one by one.
689.199	But they came
690.375	with pre-determined solutions.
693.095	They didn't come ready
693.095	to observe and to adapt
698.215	based on the community's needs.
702.75	One organization gave them
702.75	goats and chickens.
707.484	But they didn't realize
708.817	that there was so much hunger
708.817	in that community,
712.76	that when the Deaf went to sleep
712.76	at night and couldn't hear,
716.61	people broke into their yards
716.61	and their homes
719.898	and stole these chickens and goats,
722.803	and eventually they were all gone.
726.896	Now, if that organization
726.896	had taken the time
731.449	to observe Deaf people,
731.449	to observe the community,
737.029	they would have realized their problem
739.273	and perhaps they would have
739.273	come up with a solution,
743.693	something like a solar light,
746.795	lighting up a secure pen
746.795	to put them in at night
751	to ensure their safety.
754.018	You don't have to be a design thinker
758.013	to insert the ideas
758.013	I've shared with you today.
763.387	You are creative.
766.793	You are a designer --
769.319	everyone is.
772.152	Let people like me help you.
776.27	Let people with disabilities
776.27	help you look sideways,
780.879	and in the process,
782.465	solve some of the greatest problems.
785.605	That's it. Thank you.
786.976	(Applause)
