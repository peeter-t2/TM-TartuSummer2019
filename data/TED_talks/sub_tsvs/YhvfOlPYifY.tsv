16.148	I, like many of you,
18.053	am one of the two billion people
18.053	on Earth who live in cities.
24.735	And there are days --
24.735	I don't know about the rest of you --
27.674	but there are days when I palpably feel
31.26	how much I rely on other people
33.761	for pretty much everything in my life.
36.609	And some days, that can even
36.609	be a little scary.
39.954	But what I'm here
39.954	to talk to you about today
42.062	is how that same interdependence
44.868	is actually an extremely
44.868	powerful social infrastructure
49.381	that we can actually harness
51.389	to help heal some
51.389	of our deepest civic issues,
55.824	if we apply open-source collaboration.
60.248	A couple of years ago,
61.616	I read an article by New York Times
61.616	writer Michael Pollan,
65.138	in which he argued that growing
65.138	even some of our own food
69.261	is one of the best things
69.261	that we can do for the environment.
73.296	Now at the time that I was reading this,
75.225	it was the middle of the winter
76.89	and I definitely did not have room
76.89	for a lot of dirt
80.221	in my New York City apartment.
82.374	So I was basically just willing to settle
84.364	for just reading the next Wired magazine
86.334	and finding out how the experts
86.334	were going to figure out
88.978	how to solve all these problems
88.978	for us in the future.
92.078	But that was actually exactly the point
94.351	that Michael Pollan
94.351	was making in this article --
96.661	it's precisely when we hand over
98.894	the responsibility
98.894	for all these things to specialists
102.16	that we cause the kind of messes
102.16	that we see with the food system.
107.26	So, I happen to know
107.26	a little bit from my own work
110.618	about how NASA has been using hydroponics
114.897	to explore growing food in space.
118.144	And that you can actually
118.144	get optimal nutritional yield
122.583	by running a kind of high-quality
122.583	liquid soil over plants' root systems.
129.191	Now to a vegetable plant,
130.8	my apartment has got to be
130.8	about as foreign as outer space.
135.31	But I can offer some natural light
137.795	and year-round climate control.
140.49	Fast-forward two years later:
142.21	we now have window farms,
143.958	which are vertical, hydroponic platforms
146.035	for food-growing indoors.
148.884	And the way it works
148.884	is that there's a pump at the bottom,
151.663	which periodically sends this liquid
151.663	nutrient solution up to the top,
155.24	which then trickles down
155.24	through plants' root systems
157.908	that are suspended in clay pellets --
160.073	so there's no dirt involved.
162.567	Now light and temperature vary
162.567	with each window's microclimate,
167.298	so a window farm requires a farmer,
171.08	and she must decide
172.601	what kind of crops she is going
172.601	to put in her window farm,
176.36	and whether she is going
176.36	to feed her food organically.
180.293	Back at the time,
181.468	a window farm was no more
181.468	than a technically complex idea
184.673	that was going to require
184.673	a lot of testing.
187.26	And I really wanted it
187.26	to be an open project,
190.034	because hydroponics
191.26	is one of the fastest
191.26	growing areas of patenting
194	in the United States right now,
195.686	and could possibly become
195.686	another area like Monsanto,
199.381	where we have a lot of corporate
199.381	intellectual property
202.445	in the way of people's food.
205.372	So I decided that,
205.372	instead of creating a product,
209.019	what I was going to do
210.21	was open this up
210.21	to a whole bunch of codevelopers.
214.619	The first few systems that we created,
214.619	they kind of worked.
217.405	We were actually able to grow
217.405	about a salad a week
219.763	in a typical New York City
219.763	apartment window.
222.177	And we were able to grow cherry tomatoes
224.23	and cucumbers, all kinds of stuff.
226.234	But the first few systems
227.737	were these leaky, loud power-guzzlers
231.292	that Martha Stewart
231.292	would definitely never have approved.
234.074	(Laughter)
235.946	So to bring on more codevelopers,
238.355	what we did was we created
238.355	a social media site
241.281	on which we published the designs,
243.25	we explained how they worked,
245.268	and we even went so far
247.671	as to point out everything
247.671	that was wrong with these systems.
250.939	And then we invited people
250.939	all over the world
253.331	to build them and experiment with us.
256.62	So actually now on this website,
258.807	we have 18,000 people.
261.528	And we have window farms
261.528	all over the world.
265.701	What we're doing
265.701	is what NASA or a large corporation
269.497	would call R&amp;D,
269.497	or research and development.
273.012	But what we call it is R&amp;D-I-Y,
275.949	"or ""research and develop it yourself."""
278.612	(Laughter)
280.108	So, for example, Jackson came along
282.687	and suggested that we use air pumps
282.687	instead of water pumps.
285.862	It took building a whole bunch
285.862	of systems to get it right,
288.601	but once we did, we were able to cut
288.601	our carbon footprint nearly in half.
293.134	Tony in Chicago has been taking on
293.134	growing experiments,
296.142	like lots of other window farmers,
297.82	and he's been able to get
297.82	his strawberries to fruit
300.807	for nine months of the year
300.807	in low-light conditions
303.59	by simply changing out
303.59	the organic nutrients.
307.541	And window farmers in Finland
307.541	have been customizing their window farms
311.939	for the dark days of the Finnish winters
314.303	by outfitting them with LED grow lights
316.404	that they're now making
316.404	open source and part of the project.
319.721	So window farms have been evolving
322.114	through a rapid versioning process
322.114	similar to software.
325.899	And with every open source project,
328.593	the real benefit is the interplay
330.331	between the specific concerns
330.331	of people customizing their systems
334.794	for their own particular concerns,
336.637	and the universal concerns.
338.709	So my core team and I
340.666	are able to concentrate
340.666	on the improvements
343.24	that really benefit everyone.
345.508	And we're able to look out
345.508	for the needs of newcomers.
348.751	So for do-it-yourselfers,
350.505	we provide free,
350.505	very well-tested instructions
354.651	so that anyone, anywhere around the world,
356.76	can build one of these systems for free.
358.933	And there's a patent pending
358.933	on these systems as well
361.679	that's held by the community.
363.47	And to fund the project,
365.398	we partner to create products
367.724	that we then sell
367.724	to schools and to individuals
370.625	who don't have time
370.625	to build their own systems.
373.996	Now within our community,
373.996	a certain culture has appeared.
377.485	In our culture,
377.485	it is better to be a tester
380.222	who supports someone else's idea
382.515	than it is to be just the idea guy.
385.709	What we get out of this project
385.709	is support for our own work,
389.861	as well as an experience
389.861	of actually contributing
393.806	to the environmental movement
395.956	in a way other than just
395.956	screwing in new light bulbs.
399.415	But I think that Eleen expresses best
402.086	what we really get out of this,
403.587	which is the actual joy of collaboration.
406.946	So she expresses here what it's like
409.26	to see someone halfway across the world
411.761	having taken your idea, built upon it
414.087	and then acknowledging
414.087	you for contributing.
416.8	If we really want to see
416.8	the kind of wide consumer behavior change
420.731	that we're all talking about
420.731	as environmentalists and food people,
424.41	maybe we just need
424.41	"to ditch the term ""consumer"""
426.819	and get behind the people
426.819	who are doing stuff.
430.639	Open source projects
430.639	tend to have a momentum of their own.
433.835	And what we're seeing is that R&amp;D-I-Y
435.899	has moved beyond
435.899	just window farms and LEDs
439.702	into solar panels and aquaponic systems.
443.893	And we're building upon innovations
443.893	of generations who went before us.
447.835	And we're looking ahead at generations
449.673	who really need us
449.673	to retool our lives now.
453.675	So we ask that you join us
455.464	in rediscovering the value
455.464	of citizens united,
459.814	and to declare
459.814	that we are all still pioneers.
464.53	(Applause)
