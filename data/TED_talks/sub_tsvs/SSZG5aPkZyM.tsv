14.46	I'd like to introduce you to my mom.
18.86	(Laughter)
20.74	I'm guessing that's not what you expected,
23.86	and it's not what I expected either,
25.86	and thank goodness I realized
25.86	that an Asian man was not my mom
30.34	before I hugged him,
32.46	because that would have been so awkward.
36.62	Recognizing people
36.62	isn't one of my strengths
39.7	due to a genetic visual impairment
39.7	that has no correction or cure.
44.579	As a result, I am legally blind,
47.54	"though I prefer ""partially sighted"""
47.54	because it's more optimistic.
51.26	(Laughter)
52.9	"And I'm entitled to the label ""disabled."""
58.42	I hate the word disabled
58.42	when it's used to describe people.
62.94	It detonates a mindset of less than
67.18	that utterly disregards capacity,
70.1	ability, potential,
72.74	instead prioritizing brokenness
76.62	and lack.
79.34	The perspective can be overt.
83.14	What can't he do for himself
83.14	that I'm going to have to do for him?
87.46	She'll probably need some accommodation
89.58	that no other employee
89.58	at this business needs.
93.42	Sometimes, the hidden bias
96.94	is so sweetly conveyed.
100.26	"""Wow, Susan,"
102.82	look at everything you've done
102.82	in your career and your life.
107.3	How did you do all of that
107.3	"and be visually impaired?"""
111.7	(Laughter)
116.3	I fail at being disabled.
119.14	(Laughter)
120.54	So in the spirit of incentivizing
120.54	the rampant failure
123.9	of people all over the world
126.22	and enticing the so-called normal
126.22	to just give it a rest already,
131.78	here are five tips
133.74	to fail at being disabled.
137.94	Tip one:
139.38	know your superpowers.
141.459	The best team I ever led in my career
144.26	was based on superpowers,
146.3	and we even gave ourselves
146.3	fancy-pantsy titles
148.98	"like ""the Pillar of Masterly Acumen."""
153.42	"""The Biscuit Butterer."""
155.3	(Laughter)
156.94	"""The Voice of Reason."""
159.18	Because we relied on our strengths,
161.98	our best strengths,
164.26	we achieved tremendous outcomes.
168.46	The trait that prevents me
168.46	from recognizing my mom
171.78	allows me to smoothly adapt,
174.66	to quickly absorb and accurately process
174.66	an exhausting volume of cues,
180.5	tease out what's important,
182.42	determine multiple processes or potentials
182.42	for any situation that I'm in,
187.5	and then select the one
187.5	that makes the most sense,
191.5	all in a matter of seconds.
194.06	I see what other people do not.
197.86	Some people think that's a superpower,
200.62	but my real superpowers
203.14	are ricocheting off of glass walls --
205.26	(Laughter)
206.78	and letting my friends
206.78	walk around with kale in their teeth.
209.94	(Laughter)
213.26	It's true. Don't have lunch with me,
217.14	or dinner.
219.58	Tip two: be supremely skilled,
223.58	supremely skilled at getting it wrong.
227.3	It is important to be
227.3	as equally confident in your superpowers
231.1	as you are in you FUBARs.
234.46	"That's ""effed up beyond all recognition"""
237.02	for you millennials.
238.26	(Laughter)
239.74	Here's a good example.
242.06	It is not a great idea to say,
245.98	"""Don't worry, everything in here"
245.98	"is too small for me to see"""
250.78	when you accidentally
250.78	walk into the men's room --
254.58	(Laughter)
260.5	at one of the world's
260.5	largest sporting arenas --
264.82	(Laughter)
267.58	or anywhere.
269.7	I really wish that one wasn't true.
273.54	I'm serious. It is better to just walk out
273.54	and let them think you're drunk.
278.02	(Laughter)
279.94	Tip three: know that everyone
279.94	is disabled in some way,
284.9	like when you have a cold
284.9	and you can't smell
287.22	and you realize that the milk
287.22	that you splashed in your coffee was sour
290.62	only after you've tasted it.
293.74	Very recently, a woman
293.74	walked up to me frantic.
297.14	She could not find
297.14	the bakery she was looking for.
300.7	As I motioned in the direction
300.7	I thought she should go,
303.34	"saying, ""There are no stores"
303.34	on this side of the street
306.3	"so your best bet is to cross --"""
308.34	"""Oh my goodness,"" she interrupted."
311.74	"""There it is."
313.58	"All I needed was another set of eyes."""
316.5	(Laughter)
321.86	I just let her have it.
324.74	I would have said that, you know,
327.94	being logical and paying attention
330.66	and staying calm
330.66	would have done the trick,
333.62	but who am I?
336.06	Tip four: point out
336.06	the disability in others.
340.9	This one is best reserved --
340.9	very important note --
343.34	this one is best reserved
343.34	for people you know well,
346.06	because random strangers
346.06	typically don't appreciate
350.54	teachable moments.
352.66	A few years ago, my parents and I
352.66	went to see the Rockettes,
356.34	Radio City's high-kicking dancers.
359.86	I leaned over to my dad.
362.58	"""The two Rockettes on the left"
362.58	"aren't kicking in a straight line."""
367.62	"""Yes, they are."""
369.62	"""No, they're not."""
371.94	"""Yes, they are, and how do you know?"
373.7	"You can't see."""
375.7	But I know what
375.7	a straight line looks like.
379.7	I had snapped a picture
379.7	during our back and forth
382.38	and presented him the evidence
382.38	that proved I was right.
386.66	He looked at the picture.
388.66	I leaned in further.
390.66	"""Who's disabled now?"""
394.34	Tip five: pursue audacious goals.
398.34	Flip expectation upside down
400.78	and shove limitation off a cliff
400.78	to meet its demise.
405.74	There is a college football linebacker
407.78	who blitzes, tackles, recovers fumbles
411.06	while having one hand.
413.3	There is a teacher
413.3	who successfully transfers knowledge
416.46	and inspires countless students
419.54	while living with Down syndrome.
422.1	And for me,
424.06	on my long list,
425.98	to cycle from Kathmandu, Nepal,
425.98	to Darjeeling, India
429.86	on the backseat
429.86	of a bicycle built for two.
433.62	It will be an exciting 620-mile adventure,
438.46	and I'm sure I will have
438.46	the blurry photos to show for it.
442.14	(Laughter)
443.98	Oh, before we go on,
443.98	I forgot to introduce you to my mom.
447.3	I need to do that.
450.18	And here she is,
451.58	as she would appear to me
453.66	if I were looking through a crowd
453.66	of people looking for her.
457.62	Or is that an Asian man?
460.66	Thank you.
461.9	(Applause)
