12.7	When someone mentions Cuba,
14.42	what do you think about?
17.02	Classic, classic cars?
19.1	Perhaps good cigars?
21.42	Maybe you think
21.42	of a famous baseball player.
23.54	What about when somebody
23.54	mentions North Korea?
25.9	You think about those missile tests,
28.02	maybe their notorious leader
29.94	or his good friend, Dennis Rodman.
32.46	(Laughter)
33.98	One thing that likely doesn't come to mind
36.34	is a vision of a country,
38.78	an open economy,
40.06	whose citizens have access to a wide range
40.06	of affordable consumer products.
47.06	I'm not here to argue how these countries
47.06	got to where they are today.
51.7	I simply want to use them
51.7	as an example of countries and citizens
55.42	who have been affected,
55.42	negatively affected,
58.66	by a trade policy that restricts imports
61.78	and protects local industries.
64.3	Recently we've heard a number of countries
67.22	talk about restricting imports
69.42	and protecting their local,
69.42	domestic industries.
72.46	Now, this may sound fine in a sound bite,
75.74	but what it really is is protectionism.
78.98	We heard a lot about this
78.98	during the 2016 presidential election.
83.42	We heard about it
83.42	during the Brexit debates
85.9	and most recently
85.9	during the French elections.
90.5	In fact, it's been
90.5	a really important topic
93.26	being talked about around the world,
95.42	and many aspiring political leaders
97.86	are running on platforms
97.86	positioning protectionism as a good thing.
102.62	Now, I could see why they think
102.62	protectionism is good,
105.42	because sometimes
105.42	it seems like trade is unfair.
110.94	Some have blamed trade
112.9	for some of the problems
112.9	we've been having here at home in the US.
116.06	For years we've been hearing
117.46	about the loss of high-paying
117.46	US manufacturing jobs.
121.38	Many think that manufacturing
121.38	is declining in the US
124.98	because companies are moving
124.98	their operations offshore
128.14	to markets with lower-cost labor
130.58	like China, Mexico and Vietnam.
134.54	They also think trade agreements
134.54	sometimes are unfair,
138.22	like NAFTA
139.94	and the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
141.78	because these trade agreements
141.78	allow companies
145.26	to reimport those cheaply
145.26	produced goods back into the US
149.54	and other countries
149.54	from where the jobs were taken.
152.7	So it kind of feels like the exporters win
155.82	and the importers lose.
158.78	Now, the reality is
160.02	output in the manufacturing
160.02	sector in the US
163.9	is actually growing,
165.66	but we are losing jobs.
167.26	We're losing lots of them.
169.22	In fact, from 2000 to 2010,
171.94	5.7 million manufacturing jobs were lost.
176.38	But they're not being lost
176.38	for the reasons you might think.
180.94	Mike Johnson in Toledo, Ohio
183.9	didn't lose his jobs at the factory
185.9	to Miguel Sanchez in Monterrey, Mexico.
188.38	No.
189.62	Mike lost his job to a machine.
196.74	have been eliminated
196.74	because we've made improvements
199.58	in our own productivity
199.58	through automation.
203.54	So that means that one out of 10
203.54	lost manufacturing jobs
208.26	was due to offshoring.
211.5	Now, this is not just a US phenomenon.
213.94	No.
215.18	In fact, automation is spreading
215.18	to every production line
218.54	in every country around the world.
221.54	But look, I get it:
223.18	if you just lost your job
224.7	and then you read in the newspaper
226.38	that your old company
226.38	just struck up a deal with China,
229.02	it's easy to think you were just replaced
231.5	in a one-for-one deal.
233.9	When I hear stories like this,
233.9	I think that what people picture
236.9	is that trade happens
236.9	between only two countries.
240.94	Manufacturers in one country
243.38	produce products and they export them
245.34	to consumers in other countries,
248.82	and it feels like
248.82	the manufacturing countries win
251.86	and the importing countries lose.
255.34	Well, reality's a little bit different.
259.22	I'm a supply chain professional,
260.82	and I live and work in Mexico.
264.34	And I work in the middle
265.62	of a highly connected network
265.62	of manufacturers
268.82	all collaborating from around the world
270.98	to produce many
270.98	of the products we use today.
274.42	What I see
275.66	from my front-row seat in Mexico City
278.26	actually looks more like this.
281.5	And this is a more accurate depiction
281.5	of what trade really looks like.
286.436	I've had the pleasure of being able to see
288.46	how many different products
288.46	are manufactured,
290.98	from golf clubs to laptop computers
293.82	to internet servers, automobiles
296.42	and even airplanes.
298.34	And believe me, none of it
298.34	happens in a straight line.
302.26	Let me give you an example.
305.34	A few months ago, I was touring
305.34	the manufacturing plant
309.62	of a multinational aerospace company
312.62	in Quer√©taro, Mexico,
314.74	and the VP of logistics points out
314.74	a completed tail assembly.
319.26	It turns out the tail assemblies
319.26	are assembled from panels
323.66	that are manufactured in France,
326.18	and they're assembled in Mexico
328.42	using components imported from the US.
331.86	When those tail assemblies are done,
333.9	they're exported via truck to Canada
336.38	to their primary assembly plant
338.58	where they come together
339.86	with thousands of other parts,
342.3	like the wings and the seats
344.7	and the little shades
344.7	over the little windows,
347.62	all coming in to become
347.62	a part of a new airplane.
351.3	Think about it.
353.14	These new airplanes,
354.62	before they even take their first flight,
357.22	they have more stamps in their passports
359.7	than Angelina Jolie.
362.58	Now, this approach to processing
362.58	goes on all around the world
366.1	to manufacture many of the products
368.62	we use every day,
371.18	from skin cream to airplanes.
374.34	When you go home tonight,
374.34	take a look in your house.
377.5	You might be surprised to find
377.5	a label that looks like this one:
381.9	"""Manufactured in the USA"
381.9	"from US and foreign parts."""
386.98	Economist Michael Porter
389.18	described what's going on here best.
391.66	Many decades ago, he said
391.66	that it's most beneficial for a country
396.42	to focus on producing the products
396.42	it can produce most efficiently
400.82	and trading for the rest.
403.82	So what he's talking about here
403.82	is shared production,
407.34	and efficiency is the name of the game.
410.54	You've probably seen an example of this
413.1	at home or at work.
415.62	Let's take a look at an example.
417.38	Think about how your house was built
420.34	or your kitchen renovated.
422.42	Typically, there's a general contractor
424.9	who is responsible
424.9	for coordinating the efforts
427.14	of all the different contractors:
428.78	an architect to draw the plans,
431.3	an earth-moving company
431.3	to dig the foundation,
434.26	a plumber, a carpenter and so on.
436.82	So why doesn't the general contractor
438.7	pick just one company
441.34	to do all the work,
442.58	like, say, the architect?
444.42	Because this is silly.
446.58	The general contractor selects experts
448.9	because it takes years
450.66	to learn and master
452.42	how to do each of the tasks it takes
452.42	to build a house or renovate a kitchen,
456.22	some of them requiring special training.
459.86	Think about it:
461.1	Would you want your architect
461.1	to install your toilet?
465.14	Of course not.
466.58	So let's apply this process
466.58	to the corporate world.
470.02	Companies today focus on manufacturing
472.62	what they produce best
472.62	and most efficiently,
475.98	and they trade for everything else.
478.5	So this means they rely
481.22	on a global, interconnected,
481.22	interdependent network of manufacturers
486.22	to produce these products.
487.5	In fact, that network is so interconnected
489.58	it's almost impossible
491.9	to dismantle and produce
491.9	products in just one country.
495.94	Let's take a look
495.94	at the interconnected web
498.26	we saw a few moments ago,
499.94	and let's focus on just one strand
502.26	between the US and Mexico.
506.46	The Wilson Institute says
506.46	that shared production represents
	in trade between the US and Mexico.
514.9	That's about 200 billion dollars,
517.58	or the same as the GDP for Portugal.
521.54	So let's just imagine
524.1	that the US decides to impose
527.22	a 20 percent border tax
527.22	on all imports from Mexico.
531.66	OK, fine.
532.9	But do you think Mexico is just
532.9	going to stand by and let that happen?
537.94	No. No way.
539.66	So in retaliation,
539.66	they impose a similar tax
542.74	on all goods being imported from the US,
546.46	and a little game of tit-for-tat ensues,
550.02	and 20 percent -- just imagine
550.02	that 20 percent duties
553.5	are added to every good,
553.5	product, product component
557.02	crossing back and forth across the border,
559.74	and you could be looking at more
559.74	than a 40 percent increase in duties,
563.1	or 80 billion dollars.
565.62	Now, don't kid yourself,
567.42	these costs are going to be passed along
569.74	to you and to me.
573.78	Now, let's think about what impact
573.78	that might have on some of the products,
579.06	or the prices of the products,
579.06	that we buy every day.
582.42	So if a 30 percent increase in duties
582.42	were actually passed along,
586.86	we would be looking at some
586.86	pretty important increases in prices.
591.46	A Lincoln MKZ would go
591.46	from 37,000 dollars to 48,000.
596.58	And the price of a Sharp 60-inch HDTV
600.62	would go from 898 dollars
600.62	to 1,167 dollars.
605.86	And the price of a 16-ounce jar
605.86	of CVS skin moisturizer
610.02	would go from 13 dollars to 17 dollars.
614.06	Now, remember, this is only looking
614.06	at one strand of the production chain
619.46	between the US and Mexico,
620.86	so multiply this out
620.86	across all of the strands.
624.42	The impact could be considerable.
626.1	Now, just think about this:
628.78	even if we were able
628.78	to dismantle this network
633.3	and produce products in just one country,
636.54	which by the way is easier said than done,
639.06	we would still only
639.06	be saving or protecting
642.5	one out of 10 lost manufacturing jobs.
645.42	That's right, because remember,
649.22	most of those jobs, 87 percent,
651.9	were lost due to improvements
651.9	in our own productivity.
655.34	And unfortunately,
655.34	those jobs, they're gone for good.
659.98	So the real question is,
662.34	does it make sense for us
662.34	to drive up prices
664.7	to the point where many of us can't afford
664.7	the basic goods we use every day
671.1	for the purpose of saving a job
673.34	that might be eliminated
673.34	in a couple of years anyway?
677.86	The reality is that shared production
679.9	allows us to manufacture
679.9	higher quality products
683.58	at lower costs.
684.82	It's that simple.
686.78	It allows us to get more
688.66	out of the limited resources
688.66	and expertise we have
691.1	and at the same time
691.1	benefit from lower prices.
695.38	It's really important to remember
697.46	that for shared production
697.46	to be effective,
700.3	it relies on efficient cross-border
700.3	movement of raw materials,
705.74	components and finished products.
708.78	So remember this:
710.94	the next time you're hearing somebody
710.94	try to sell you on the idea
715.02	that protectionism is a good deal,
718.26	it's just not.
719.86	Thank you.
721.1	(Applause)
