12.772	Two months ago, my kids and I
12.772	huddled around a cell phone
16.98	watching the live stream
16.98	of the Game Awards,
19.3	one of the video game
19.3	industry's biggest nights.
22.22	They announced the nominees
22.22	for the Game for Impact,
25.9	an award that's given
25.9	to a thought-provoking video game
28.98	with a profound prosocial
28.98	message or meaning.
32.78	They opened the envelope
34.5	and they read the title of our video game.
37.74	An award ...
39.14	for impact.
40.98	It was almost funny, actually,
42.7	because I always thought
42.7	that winning an award like that
45.38	would have this huge impact on my life,
48.06	but I found that the opposite is true.
51.66	The big nights,
53.1	the accomplishments --
55.22	they fade.
56.82	But the hardest nights of my life
56.82	have stuck with me,
60.26	impacting who I am
62.78	and what I do.
65.18	In 2010, my third son, Joel, was diagnosed
65.18	with a rare and aggressive brain tumor.
72.3	And before that year was finished,
74.26	doctors sat my husband and I down
76.82	and let us know
76.82	that his tumor had returned
80.1	despite the most aggressive chemotherapy
80.1	and radiation that they could offer him.
85.9	On that terrible night,
87.82	after learning that Joel
87.82	had perhaps four months to live,
91.94	I cuddled up with
91.94	my two older sons in bed --
94.82	they were five and three at the time --
97.38	and I never really knew
97.38	how much they understood,
100.5	so I started telling them a bedtime story.
104.22	I told them about this
104.22	very brave knight named Joel
108.1	and his adventure fighting
108.1	a terrible dragon called cancer.
113.54	Every night, I told them
113.54	more of the story,
116.62	but I never let the story end.
118.66	I was just building up a context
118.66	that they could understand
121.82	and hoping that our prayers
121.82	would be answered
124.1	and I would never
124.1	have to tell them that that knight,
126.62	who had fought so bravely,
128.94	was done fighting
130.5	and could rest now, forever.
134.26	Fortunately, I never did have to
134.26	finish that bedtime story.
138.78	My children outgrew it.
140.98	Joel responded better than anyone expected
140.98	to palliative treatment,
145.1	and so instead of months,
146.78	we spent years learning how to love
146.78	our dying child with all of our hearts.
153.9	Learning to recognize
153.9	that shameful feeling
156.46	of holding back just a little love
159.38	to try to spare ourselves
159.38	just a little pain
162.26	somewhere further down the road.
165.58	We pushed past that self-preservation
168.06	because Joel was worth loving
168.06	even if that love could crush us.
174.02	And that lesson of intense
174.02	vulnerability has changed me ...
179.26	more than any award ever could.
182.22	We started living like Joel could live,
185.58	and we began developing a video game
185.58	"called ""That Dragon, Cancer."""
191.74	It was the story of Joel.
194.58	It was the story of hope
194.58	in the shadow of death.
198.1	It was the story of faith
200.46	and doubt,
201.94	and the realization that a wrestle
201.94	with doubt is a part of faith --
207.94	maybe the biggest part of it.
210.38	It was a story that began as a miracle
213.86	and ended as a memorial.

247.1	[That Dragon, Cancer]
250.14	(Music)
255.38	"When you play ""That Dragon, Cancer,"""
257.3	you're transformed
257.3	into a witness of Joel's life,
261.3	exploring an emotional landscape,
263.5	clicking to discover more of what
263.5	we as a family felt and experienced.
269.06	It feels a little bit
269.06	like analyzing interactive poetry
273.62	because every game mechanic is a metaphor,
275.98	and so the more the player asks themselves
278.38	what we as designers
278.38	were trying to express and why,
282.34	the richer the experience becomes.
285.22	We took that vulnerability
285.22	that Joel taught us,
288.26	and we encoded the game with it.
291.34	Players expect their video games
291.34	to offer them branching narrative
294.94	so that every decision
294.94	that they make feels important
298.5	and can change the outcome of the game.
301.22	We subverted that principle
301.22	of game design,
304.02	collapsing the choices in on the player
307.42	so that they discover for themselves
309.22	that there is nothing that they can do
309.22	that will change the outcome for Joel.
314.1	And they feel that discovery
314.1	as deeply and desperately as we felt it
319.9	on nights when we held Joel
319.9	in our arms praying for hours,
324.1	stubbornly holding out hope for a grace
324.1	that we could not create for ourselves.
330.78	We'd all prefer to win,
332.98	but when you discover that you can't win,
336.38	what do you value instead?
339.42	I never planned to write video games,
341.66	but these moments
341.66	that really change our lives,
344.22	they often come as the result
344.22	of our hardship -- and not our glory.
349.34	When we thought that Joel could live,
351.46	I left the game designing to my husband.
353.62	I chimed in here and there
355.7	with a scene or two and some suggestions.
358.7	But after the night that Joel died,
362.3	the passion,
363.74	the possibility of sharing Joel's life
363.74	through our video game --
367.94	it was something that I couldn't resist.
370.1	I started writing more,
371.46	I sat in on our team's design meetings,
373.9	I added more ideas
373.9	and I helped direct scenes.
377.02	And I discovered that creating
377.02	a video game is telling a story,
381.94	but with an entirely new vocabulary.
384.7	All the same elements of imagination
384.7	and symbolism are there,
390.26	but they're just partnered
390.26	with player agency
392.9	and system responsiveness.
395.9	It's challenging work.
397.58	I have to think
397.58	in a totally new way to do it,
400.62	but I love it.
402.3	And I wouldn't have known
402.3	that without Joel.
406.1	Maybe you're a little surprised
408.42	by our choice to share our story
408.42	of terminal cancer through a video game.
414.18	Perhaps you're even thinking
414.18	like so many people before you:
417.54	cancer is not a game.
421.1	Well, tell that
421.1	to any pediatric cancer parent
423.3	that's ever taken an exam glove
423.3	and blown it up into a balloon,
427.26	or transformed a syringe
427.26	into a rocket ship,
430.02	or let their child ride their IV pole
430.02	through the hospital halls
434.18	like it was a race car.
436.7	Because when you have children,
438.82	everything is a game.
441.46	And when your young child
441.46	experiences something traumatic,
445.42	you work even harder to make sure
445.42	that their life feels like a game
449.5	because children naturally
449.5	explore their worlds through play.
454.14	While cancer can steal
454.14	many things from a family,
457.1	it shouldn't steal play.
459.7	If you're listening to me
459.7	and you're trying to imagine this family
463.3	that revolves entirely
463.3	around a dying child,
467.54	and you can't imagine joy
467.54	as part of that picture,
471.58	then we were right
471.58	to share our story with you,
474.66	because that season of our life was hard.
478.34	Unspeakably hard at times,
481.14	but it was also pure hope,
483.82	deep love
485.46	and joy like I have never
485.46	experienced since.
489.54	Our video game was our attempt
489.54	to share that world
493.7	with people who hadn't
493.7	experienced it before,
495.94	because we never could imagine
495.94	that world until it became ours.
501.02	We made a video game that's hard to play.
505.18	It will never be a blockbuster.
507.46	People have to prepare themselves
507.46	to invest emotionally
511.22	in a story that they know
511.22	will break their hearts.
515.7	But when our hearts break,
518.06	they heal a little differently.
521.82	My broken heart has been healing
521.82	with a new and a deeper compassion --
526.739	a desire to sit with people in their pain,
529.7	to hear their stories
529.7	and try to help tell them
532.739	so that they know that they're seen.
536.42	"On the night when ""That Dragon, Cancer"""
536.42	won the Game for Impact Award,
540.78	we cheered,
542.22	we smiled and we talked about Joel
545.42	and the impact he had on our life --
547.7	on all of those hard and hopeful nights
547.7	that we shared with him
551.82	when he changed our hearts
553.3	and taught us so much more
553.3	about life and love and faith and purpose.
560.38	That award will never mean as much to me
560.38	as even a single photograph of my son,
567.02	but it does represent all of the people
567.02	who his life has impacted,
571.7	people I'll never meet.
573.82	They write me emails sometimes.
576.7	They tell me that they miss Joel,
576.7	even though they never met him.
582.18	They describe the tears
582.18	that they've shed for my son,
587.74	and it makes my burden of grief
587.74	just a little bit lighter
591.58	knowing that it's shared
591.58	with a 10-year-old
593.7	watching a YouTube playthrough,
595.74	or a doctor playing on his airplane
595.74	with a smartphone,
599.98	or a professor introducing Joel
599.98	to her first-year philosophy students.
606.62	We made a video game that's hard to play.
611.1	But that feels just right to me,
614.06	because the hardest moments of our lives
616.66	change us more than any goal
616.66	we could ever accomplish.
621.14	Tragedy has shifted my heart
623.82	more than any dream
623.82	I could ever see come true.
627.94	Thank you.
629.18	(Applause)
