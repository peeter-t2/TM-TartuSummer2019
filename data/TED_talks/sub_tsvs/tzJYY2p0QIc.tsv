12.815	I'd like to talk today
14.45	about how we can change our brains
16.922	and our society.
19.515	Meet Joe.
21.69	Joe's 32 years old and a murderer.
25.408	I met Joe 13 years ago on the lifer wing
28.15	at Wormwood Scrubs high-security prison in London.
31.97	I'd like you to imagine this place.
33.971	It looks and feels like it sounds:
37.069	Wormwood Scrubs.
39.451	Built at the end of the Victorian Era
41.675	by the inmates themselves,
43.187	it is where England's most
43.187	dangerous prisoners are kept.
46.387	These individuals have committed acts
48.593	of unspeakable evil.
50.763	And I was there to study their brains.
54.474	I was part of a team of researchers
56.226	from University College London,
57.903	on a grant from the U.K. department of health.
60.658	My task was to study a group of inmates
62.706	who had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths.
65.45	That meant they were the most
67.175	callous and the most aggressive
68.888	of the entire prison population.
72.012	What lay at the root of their behavior?
75.589	Was there a neurological cause for their condition?
79.915	And if there was a neurological cause,
82.758	could we find a cure?
85.813	So I'd like to speak about change, and 
85.813	especially about emotional change.
89.758	Growing up, I was always intrigued
91.738	by how people change.
94.802	My mother, a clinical psychotherapist,
97.325	would occasionally see patients at home
99.965	in the evening.
101.385	She would shut the door to the living room,
102.919	and I imagined
104.924	magical things happened in that room.
107.436	At the age of five or six
109.117	I would creep up in my pajamas
111.559	and sit outside with my ear glued to the door.
114.368	On more than one occasion, I fell asleep
115.815	and they had to push me out of the way
117.275	at the end of the session.
119.436	And I suppose that's how I found myself
122.335	walking into the secure interview room
124.41	on my first day at Wormwood Scrubs.
128.419	Joe sat across a steel table
130.755	and greeted me with this blank expression.
134.981	The prison warden, looking equally indifferent,
137.859	"said, ""Any trouble, just press the red buzzer,"
140.506	"and we'll be around as soon as we can."""
142.945	(Laughter)
145.903	I sat down.
147.673	The heavy metal door slammed shut behind me.
150.65	I looked up at the red buzzer
152.744	far behind Joe on the opposite wall.
154.843	(Laughter)
157.489	I looked at Joe.
159.251	Perhaps detecting my concern,
161.328	he leaned forward, and said,
162.684	as reassuringly as he could,
164.911	"""Ah, don't worry about the buzzer,"
166.291	"it doesn't work anyway."""
168.544	(Laughter)
175.472	Over the subsequent months,
177.361	we tested Joe and his fellow inmates,
181.446	looking specifically at their ability
183.497	to categorize different images of emotion.
188.481	And we looked at their physical response
190.267	to those emotions.
192.009	So, for example, when most of us look
193.59	at a picture like this of somebody looking sad,
196.515	we instantly have a slight,
200.066	measurable physical response:
202	increased heart rate, sweating of the skin.
205.298	Whilst the psychopaths in our study were able
207.082	to describe the pictures accurately,
209.096	they failed to show the emotions required.
212.829	They failed to show a physical response.
216.382	It was as though they knew the words
218.433	but not the music of empathy.
221.826	So we wanted to look closer at this
223.61	to use MRI to image their brains.
227.059	That turned out to be not such an easy task.
230.166	Imagine transporting a collection
231.995	of clinical psychopaths across central London
234.69	in shackles and handcuffs
236.829	in rush hour,
238.955	and in order to place each
238.955	of them in an MRI scanner,
242.129	you have to remove all metal objects,
244.11	including shackles and handcuffs,
245.444	and, as I learned, all body piercings.
249.799	After some time, however,
249.799	we had a tentative answer.
254.036	These individuals were not just the victims
256.854	of a troubled childhood.
258.906	There was something else.
261.427	People like Joe have a deficit in a brain area
265.047	called the amygdala.
267.108	The amygdala is an almond-shaped organ
269.132	deep within each of the hemispheres of the brain.
272.455	It is thought to be key to the experience of empathy.
276.94	Normally, the more empathic a person is,
279.846	the larger and more active their amygdala is.
282.891	Our population of inmates
284.371	had a deficient amygdala,
285.698	which likely led to their lack of empathy
287.993	and to their immoral behavior.
290.927	So let's take a step back.
294.069	Normally, acquiring moral behavior
296.692	is simply part of growing up,
299.082	like learning to speak.
301.283	At the age of six months, virtually every one of us
304.574	is able to differentiate between
304.574	animate and inanimate objects.
308.531	At the age of 12 months,
311.005	most children are able to imitate
314.229	the purposeful actions of others.
316.114	So for example, your mother raises her hands
318.649	to stretch, and you imitate her behavior.
321.388	At first, this isn't perfect.
324.589	I remember my cousin Sasha,
326.536	two years old at the time,
328.699	looking through a picture book
330.359	and licking one finger and flicking
330.359	the page with the other hand,
333.542	licking one finger and flicking
333.542	the page with the other hand.
335.647	(Laughter)
337.961	Bit by bit, we build the foundations 
337.961	of the social brain
341.887	so that by the time we're three, four years old,
346.519	most children, not all,
347.811	have acquired the ability to understand
349.584	the intentions of others,
351.187	another prerequisite for empathy.
354.513	The fact that this developmental progression
357.125	is universal,
358.627	irrespective of where you live in the world
360.603	or which culture you inhabit,
363.229	strongly suggests that the foundations
365.442	of moral behavior are inborn.
368.566	If you doubt this,
371.043	try, as I've done, to renege on a promise you've made
374.819	to a four-year-old.
376.896	You will find that the mind of a four-year old
378.684	is not na√Øve in the slightest.
380.188	It is more akin to a Swiss army knife
383.213	with fixed mental modules
385.244	finely honed during development
387.718	and a sharp sense of fairness.
390.835	The early years are crucial.
393.493	There seems to be a window of opportunity,
395.737	after which mastering moral questions
398.203	becomes more difficult,
399.685	like adults learning a foreign language.
403.819	That's not to say it's impossible.
405.853	A recent, wonderful study from Stanford University
408.962	showed that people who have played
411.203	a virtual reality game in which they took on
413.612	the role of a good and helpful superhero
416.073	actually became more caring and helpful
418.189	towards others afterwards.
420.692	Now I'm not suggesting
422.901	we endow criminals with superpowers,
425.956	but I am suggesting that we need to find ways
429.369	to get Joe and people like him
431.247	to change their brains and their behavior,
433.892	for their benefit
435.667	and for the benefit of the rest of us.
438.802	So can brains change?
442.337	For over 100 years,
444.921	neuroanatomists and later neuroscientists
448.035	held the view that after initial
448.035	development in childhood,
451.855	no new brain cells could grow
454.279	in the adult human brain.
455.58	The brain could only change
457.067	within certain set limits.
459.049	That was the dogma.
461.147	But then, in the 1990s,
463.386	studies starting showing,
465.082	following the lead of Elizabeth
465.082	Gould at Princeton and others,
467.819	studies started showing the
467.819	evidence of neurogenesis,
471.154	the birth of new brain cells
473.212	in the adult mammalian brain,
476.281	first in the olfactory bulb,
477.865	which is responsible for our sense of smell,
479.946	then in the hippocampus
481.985	involving short-term memory,
484.029	and finally in the amygdala itself.
487.312	In order to understand
489.088	how this process works,
491.047	I left the psychopaths and joined a lab in Oxford
493.936	specializing in learning and development.
497.198	Instead of psychopaths, I studied mice,
500.968	because the same pattern of brain responses
503.309	appears across many different
503.309	species of social animals.
507.039	So if you rear a mouse in a standard cage,
511.621	a shoebox, essentially, with cotton wool,
514.309	alone and without much stimulation,
515.876	not only does it not thrive,
517.487	but it will often develop strange,
519.244	repetitive behaviors.
520.818	This naturally sociable animal
523.437	will lose its ability to bond with other mice,
525.88	even becoming aggressive when introduced to them.
530.075	However, mice reared in what we called
532.137	an enriched environment,
533.643	a large habitation with other mice
535.854	with wheels and ladders and areas to explore,
539.284	demonstrate neurogenesis,
540.869	the birth of new brain cells,
543.169	and as we showed, they also perform better
545.483	on a range of learning and memory tasks.
548.2	Now, they don't develop morality to the point of
550.63	carrying the shopping bags of little old mice
552.39	across the street,
554.611	but their improved environment results in healthy,
557.354	sociable behavior.
559.267	Mice reared in a standard cage, by contrast,
562.21	not dissimilar, you might say, from a prison cell,
564.675	have dramatically lower levels of new neurons
567.976	in the brain.
569.603	It is now clear that the amygdala of mammals,
572.419	including primates like us,
573.925	can show neurogenesis.
576.437	In some areas of the brain,
577.723	more than 20 percent of cells are newly formed.
581.418	We're just beginning to understand
583.677	what exact function these cells have,
585.771	but what it implies is that the brain is capable
588.697	of extraordinary change way into adulthood.
593.89	However, our brains are also
595.624	exquisitely sensitive to stress in our environment.
599.264	Stress hormones, glucocorticoids,
601.814	released by the brain,
603.364	suppress the growth of these new cells.
606.925	The more stress, the less brain development,
609.473	which in turn causes less adaptability
613.941	and causes higher stress levels.
616.684	This is the interplay between nature and nurture
620.469	in real time in front of our eyes.
624.174	When you think about it,
626.241	it is ironic that our current solution
628.616	for people with stressed amygdalae
630.542	is to place them in an environment
632.334	that actually inhibits any chance of further growth.
636.663	Of course, imprisonment is a necessary part
639.15	of the criminal justice system
641.57	and of protecting society.
643.335	Our research does not suggest
644.972	that criminals should submit their MRI scans
647.189	as evidence in court
648.611	and get off the hook because
648.611	they've got a faulty amygdala.
652.269	The evidence is actually the other way.
654.342	Because our brains are capable of change,
657.193	we need to take responsibility for our actions,
659.691	and they need to take responsibility
661.543	for their rehabilitation.
664.971	One way such rehabilitation might work
666.775	is through restorative justice programs.
670.068	Here victims, if they choose to participate,
672.397	and perpetrators meet face to face
674.638	in safe, structured encounters,
677.338	and the perpetrator is encouraged
679.168	to take responsibility for their actions,
681.137	and the victim plays an active role in the process.
684.366	In such a setting, the perpetrator can see,
687.237	perhaps for the first time,
689.572	the victim as a real person
691.976	with thoughts and feelings and a genuine
693.645	emotional response.
695.483	This stimulates the amygdala
697.374	and may be a more effective rehabilitative practice
700.925	than simple incarceration.
703.991	Such programs won't work for everyone,
705.576	but for many, it could be a way
708.265	to break the frozen sea within.
712.626	So what can we do now?
715.385	How can we apply this knowledge?
717.897	I'd like to leave you with
720.218	three lessons that I learned.
721.963	The first thing that I learned was that
724.133	we need to change our mindset.
725.659	Since Wormwood Scrubs was built 130 years ago,
728.808	society has advanced in virtually every aspect,
731.923	in the way we run our schools, our hospitals.
735.337	Yet the moment we speak about prisons,
737.42	it's as though we're back in Dickensian times,
740.316	if not medieval times.
742.54	For too long, I believe,
744.774	we've allowed ourselves to be persuaded
748.439	of the false notion that human 
748.439	nature cannot change,
751.481	and as a society, it's costing us dearly.
755.144	We know that the brain is
755.144	capable of extraordinary change,
759.02	and the best way to achieve that,
762.059	even in adults, is to change and modulate
764.471	our environment.
766.266	The second thing I have learned
769.151	is that we need to create an alliance
771.777	of people who believe that science is integral
775.278	to bringing about social change.
777.56	It's easy enough for a neuroscientist to place
780.533	a high-security inmate in an MRI scanner.
782.712	Well actually, that turns out not to be so easy,
785.22	but ultimately what we want to show
787.879	is whether we're able to
787.879	reduce the reoffending rates.
791.647	In order to answer complex questions like that,
794.368	we need people of different backgrounds --
797.019	lab-based scientists and clinicians,
799.223	social workers and policy makers,
801.613	philanthropists and human rights activists ‚Äî
804.236	to work together.
806.162	Finally, I believe we need
807.849	to change our own amygdalae,
809.487	because this issue goes to the heart
812.268	not just of who Joe is,
814.039	but who we are.
815.951	We need to change our view of Joe
818.931	as someone wholly irredeemable,
822.733	because if we see Joe as wholly irredeemable,
826.243	how is he going to see himself as any different?
830.523	In another decade, Joe will be released
832.394	from Wormwood Scrubs.
835.063	Will he be among the 70 percent of inmates
837.98	who end up reoffending
839.474	and returning to the prison system?
842.256	Wouldn't it be better if, while serving his sentence,
844.892	Joe was able to train his amygdala,
846.818	which would stimulate the growth of new brain cells
849.172	and connections,
850.453	so that he will be able to face the world
853.049	once he gets released?
855.169	Surely, that would be in the interest of all of us.
861.549	(Applause)
864.8	Thank you. (Applause)
