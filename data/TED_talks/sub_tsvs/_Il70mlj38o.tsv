13.26	At 7:45 a.m., I open the doors to a building
19.607	dedicated to building, yet only breaks me down.
24.515	I march down hallways cleaned up after me every day
28.725	by regular janitors,
31.922	but I never have the decency to honor their names.
36.094	Lockers left open like teenage boys' mouths
39.262	when teenage girls wear clothes that covers
41.813	their insecurities but exposes everything else.
46.652	Masculinity mimicked by men who grew up with no fathers,
50.47	camouflage worn by bullies who are dangerously armed
54.312	but need hugs.
55.671	Teachers paid less than what it costs them to be here.
58.939	Oceans of adolescents come here to receive lessons
62.605	but never learn to swim,
64.874	part like the Red Sea when the bell rings.
67.016	This is a training ground.
69.794	My high school is Chicago,
72.101	diverse and segregated on purpose.
75.362	Social lines are barbed wire.
78.875	"Labels like ""Regulars"" and ""Honors"" resonate."
84.131	I am an Honors but go home with Regular students
88.515	who are soldiers in territory that owns them.
91.883	This is a training ground to sort out the Regulars
95.537	from the Honors, a reoccurring cycle
97.795	built to recycle the trash of this system.
101.581	Trained at a young age to capitalize,
104.575	letters taught now that capitalism raises you
107.579	but you have to step on someone else to get there.
110.428	This is a training ground where one group
113.621	is taught to lead and the other is made to follow.
116.528	No wonder so many of my people spit bars,
119.163	because the truth is hard to swallow.
122.027	The need for degrees has left so many people frozen.
126.296	Homework is stressful,
128.436	but when you go home every day and your home is work,
131.036	you don't want to pick up any assignments.
133.013	Reading textbooks is stressful,
134.987	but reading does not matter when you feel
137.243	your story is already written,
139.299	either dead or getting booked.
141.375	Taking tests is stressful,
144.2	but bubbling in a Scantron does not stop
146.788	bullets from bursting.
148.979	I hear education systems are failing,
153.564	but I believe they're succeeding at what they're built to do --
156.106	to train you, to keep you on track,
158.244	to track down an American dream that has failed
161.55	so many of us all.
165.508	(Applause)
