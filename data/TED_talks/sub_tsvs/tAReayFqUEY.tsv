12.606	Traditional prescriptions for growth
12.606	in Africa are not working very well.
18.519	After one trillion dollars
18.519	in African development-related aid
22.971	in the last 60 years,
25.099	real per capita income today
25.099	is lower than it was in the 1970s.
30.867	Aid is not doing too well.
33.17	In response,
34.588	the Bretton Woods institutions --
34.588	the IMF and the World Bank --
38.672	pushed for free trade not aid,
42.226	yet the historical record
42.226	shows little empirical evidence
46.451	that free trade leads to economic growth.
50.561	The newly prescribed 
50.561	silver bullet is microcredit.
54.46	We seem to be fixated
54.46	on this romanticized idea
58.177	that every poor peasant in Africa
58.177	is an entrepreneur.
62.031	(Laughter)
65.328	Yet my work and travel
65.328	in 40-plus countries across Africa
70.698	have taught me that most people
70.698	want jobs instead.
75.615	My solution: Forget micro-entrepreneurs.
79.19	Let's invest in building
79.19	pan-African titans
82.836	like Sudanese businessman Mo Ibrahim.
87.061	Mo took a contrarian bet on Africa when
87.061	he founded Celtel International in '98
92.959	and built it into a mobile 
92.959	cellular provider
96.494	with 24 million subscribers
96.494	across 14 African countries by 2004.
104.076	The Mo model might be better
104.076	than the everyman entrepreneur model,
107.745	which prevents an effective means
107.745	of diffusion and knowledge-sharing.
111.741	Perhaps we are not at a stage in Africa
114.357	where many actors and small enterprises
114.357	leads to growth through competition.
119.624	Consider these two alternative scenarios.
123.034	One: You loan 200 dollars 
123.034	to each of 500 banana farmers
129.07	allowing them to dry 
129.07	their surplus bananas
131.967	and fetch 15 percent more revenue
131.967	at the local market.
136.295	Or two: You give 100,000 dollars
136.295	to one savvy entrepreneur
142.477	and help her set up a factory
142.477	that yields 40 percent additional income
147.695	to all 500 banana farmers
147.695	and creates 50 additional jobs.
153.747	We invested in the second scenario,
156.371	and backed 26-year-old
156.371	Kenyan entrepreneur Eric Muthomi
160.867	to set up an agro-processing
160.867	factory called Stawi
164.536	to produce gluten-free
164.536	banana-based flour and baby food.
170.242	Stawi is leveraging economies of scale
173.283	and using modern manufacturing processes
173.283	to create value for not only its owners
178.164	but its workers, who have
178.164	an ownership in the business.
182.579	Our dream is to take an Eric Muthomi
182.579	and try to help him become a Mo Ibrahim,
188.708	which requires skill, financing,
188.708	local and global partnerships,
193.855	and extraordinary perseverance.
196.525	But why pan-African?
199.59	The scramble for Africa
199.59	during the Berlin Conference of 1884 --
204.188	where, quite frankly, we Africans
204.188	were not exactly consulted --
208.924	(Laughter) (Applause) --
215.542	resulted in massive fragmentation
218.003	and many sovereign states
218.003	with small populations:
220.534	Liberia, four million;
220.534	Cape Verde, 500,000.
223.576	Pan-Africa gives you one billion people,
226.315	granted across 55 countries
226.315	with trade barriers and other impediments,
230.472	but our ancestors traded
230.472	across the continent
233.705	before Europeans drew lines around us.
236.282	The pan-African opportunities
236.282	outweigh the challenges,
239.719	and that's why we're expanding
239.719	Stawi's markets from just Kenya
243.155	to Algeria, Nigeria, Ghana,
243.155	and anywhere else that will buy our food.
247.52	We hope to help solve food security,
247.52	empower farmers, create jobs,
251.514	develop the local economy,
251.514	and we hope to become rich in the process.
255.948	While it's not the sexiest approach,
258.167	and maybe it doesn't
258.167	achieve the same feel-good
260.415	as giving a woman 100 dollars 
260.415	to buy a goat on kiva.org,
264.306	perhaps supporting fewer,
264.306	higher-impact entrepreneurs
268.231	to build massive businesses
268.231	that scale pan-Africa
271.204	can help change this.
274.364	The political freedom
274.364	for which our forebearers fought
278.918	is meaningless without economic freedom.
283.326	We hope to aid this fight
283.326	for economic freedom
286.136	by building world-class businesses,
288.597	creating indigenous wealth,
290.571	providing jobs that we
290.571	so desperately need,
293.705	and hopefully helping achieve this.
297.792	Africa shall rise.
300.694	Thank you.
302.25	(Applause)
309.471	Tom Rielly: So Sangu, of course,
309.471	this is strong rhetoric.
313.465	You're making 100 percent contrast
313.465	between microcredit
316.46	and regular investment
316.46	and growing regular investment.
320.825	Do you think there is
320.825	a role for microcredit at all?
323.277	Sangu Delle: I think there is a role.
325.539	Microcredit has been a great,
325.539	innovative way
328.093	to expand financial access
328.093	to the bottom of the pyramid.
332.063	But for the problems we face in Africa,
334.315	when we are looking
334.315	at the Marshall Plan
336.204	to revitalize war-torn Europe,
337.821	it was not full of donations of sheep.
339.904	We need more than just microcredit.
341.626	We need more than just give 200 dollars.
343.757	We need to build big businesses,
343.757	and we need jobs.
346.831	TR: Very good. Thank you so much.
349.227	(Applause)
