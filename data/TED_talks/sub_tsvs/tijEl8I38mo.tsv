26	I'm going to talk to you today about
28	hopefully converting fear into hope.
31	When we go to the physician today --
34	when we go to the doctor's office and we walk in,
36	there are words that we just don't want to hear.
39	There are words that we're truly afraid of.
41	Diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,
45	heart failure, lung failure --
47	things that we know are debilitating diseases,
50	for which there's relatively little that can be done.
55	And what I want to lay out for you today is
57	a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease,
61	why it's important,
63	why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down
66	if you think it already hasn't,
68	and where we are clinically today, and where we might go tomorrow,
71	and what some of the hurdles are.
73	And we're going to do all of that in 18 minutes, I promise.
76	I want to start with this slide,
78	because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it.
83	This was an issue from 2002
85	that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human.
89	It was basically a regenerative medicine issue.
92	Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept
96	that everybody can understand.
98	It's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself
102	to a clinically relevant timescale.
106	So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there.
109	We know that if we have a damaged hip, you can put an artificial hip in.
113	And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover.
117	This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine.
121	This is not regenerative medicine.
123	Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up
126	when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago.
129	The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms
134	with devices and drugs and the like --
136	and I'll come back to that theme a few times --
139	instead of doing that, we will regenerate lost function of the body
143	by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue.
147	So that at the end of the treatment,
149	you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment.
154	Very few good ideas -- if you agree that this is a good idea --
157	very few good ideas are truly novel.
160	And this is just the same.
162	If you look back in history,
164	Charles Lindbergh, who was better known for flying airplanes,
168	was actually one of the first people
169	along with Alexis Carrel, one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller,
173	to begin to think about, could you culture organs?
177	And they published this book in 1937,
179	where they actually began to think about,
181	what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs?
187	We've come a long way since then.
188	I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on.
191	But before doing that, what I'd like to do
193	is share my depression about the health care system
196	and the need for this with you.
198	Many of the talks yesterday talked about
200	improving the quality of life, and reducing poverty,
203	and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe.
208	One of the challenges is that the richer we are, the longer we live.
213	And the longer we live, the more expensive it is
216	to take care of our diseases as we get older.
219	This is simply the wealth of a country
222	versus the percent of population over the age of 65.
226	And you can basically see that the richer a country is,
229	the older the people are within it.
231	Why is this important?
233	And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now?
237	If the average age of your population is 30,
239	then the average kind of disease that you have to treat
243	is maybe a broken ankle every now and again,
245	maybe a little bit of asthma.
246	If the average age in your country is 45 to 55,
250	now the average person is looking at diabetes,
253	early-onset diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery disease --
256	things that are inherently more difficult to treat,
259	and much more expensive to treat.
261	Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here.
264	"This is from ""The Untied States of America."""
266	In 1930, there were 41 workers per retiree.
275	paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease.
281	In 2010, two workers per retiree in the U.S.
284	And this is matched in every industrialized, wealthy country in the world.
290	How can you actually afford to treat patients
293	when the reality of getting old looks like this?
296	This is age versus cost of health care.
299	And you can see that right around age 45, 40 to 45,
305	there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care.
310	It's actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies,
313	you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care,
317	plotted over your lifetime.
319	And about seven years before you're about to die, there's a spike.
323	And you can actually --
324	(Laughter)
326	-- we won't get into that.
327	(Laughter)
331	There are very few things, very few things that you can really do
336	that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases
341	and experience what I would call healthy aging.
345	I'd suggest there are four things,
347	and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system.
351	All those things do is change who pays.
353	They don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is.
357	One thing you can do is not treat. You can ration health care.
361	We won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing.
364	You can prevent.
365	Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention.
369	But perhaps most interesting, to me anyway, and most important,
372	is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression,
377	and then treating the disease to cure the disease
380	instead of treating a symptom.
382	Think of it in terms of diabetes, for instance.
386	Today, with diabetes, what do we do?
388	We diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic,
391	and then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.
395	And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy.
399	But eventually it stops working,
400	and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease.
408	Why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something
411	to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease,
414	perhaps even before it was symptomatic?
417	And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it,
420	but if it worked, we would truly be able to do something different.
424	This video, I think, gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically.
429	This is a newt re-growing its limb.
433	If a newt can do this kind of thing, why can't we?
436	I'll actually show you some more important features
439	about limb regeneration in a moment.
441	But what we're talking about in regenerative medicine
444	is doing this in every organ system of the body,
447	for tissues and for organs themselves.
454	So today's reality is that if we get sick,
457	the message is we will treat your symptoms,
460	and you need to adjust to a new way of life.
463	I would pose to you that tomorrow --
465	and when tomorrow is we could debate,
467	but it's within the foreseeable future --
469	we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation.
473	There's a limb prosthetic up here,
474	similar actually one on the soldier
477	that's come back from Iraq.
479	There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs.
483	Imagine if instead of facing that, they could actually
486	face the regeneration of that limb.
488	It's a wild concept.
490	I'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept.
495	But it's applicable, again, to every organ system.
497	How can we do that?
498	The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body.
502	We need to learn to speak the body's language.
505	And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus.
510	A mammalian fetus, if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy,
515	will re-grow that limb.
517	So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms.
523	It's a natural process,
525	but it is lost as we age.
529	In a child, before the age of about six months,
532	if they lose their fingertip in an accident,
534	they'll re-grow their fingertip.
536	By the time they're five, they won't be able to do that anymore.
539	So to engage in that conversation with the body,
542	we need to speak the body's language.
544	And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today.
549	I'm going to give you an example of three of these tools
552	through which to converse with the body.
555	The first is cellular therapies.
557	Clearly, we heal ourselves in a natural process,
560	using cells to do most of the work.
563	Therefore, if we can find the right cells
565	and implant them in the body, they may do the healing.
569	Secondly, we can use materials.
571	We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials.
574	If we can invent materials, design materials,
577	or extract materials from a natural environment,
580	then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself.
584	And finally, we may be able to use smart devices
587	that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal.
592	I'm going to show you an example of each of these,
594	and I'm going to start with materials.
596	Steve Badylak -- who's at the University of Pittsburgh --
598	about a decade ago had a remarkable idea.
601	And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig,
605	if you threw away all the cells,
608	and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active,
612	may contain all of the necessary factors and signals
615	that would signal the body to heal itself.
617	And he asked a very important question.
619	He asked the question,
620	if I take that material, which is a natural material
623	that usually induces healing in the small intestine,
626	and I place it somewhere else on a person's body,
630	would it give a tissue-specific response,
633	or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear?
637	I wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling.
642	The picture I'm about to show you
644	is a compelling picture.
646	(Laughter)
648	However, for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish --
651	even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends --
654	the lights are down. This is a good time to look at your feet,
657	check your Blackberry, do anything other than look at the screen.
662	(Laughter)
665	What I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer.
669	And although -- it's good to laugh before we look at this.
672	This is the reality of diabetes.
674	I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics, diabetic ulcers,
677	we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment,
682	which is amputation, if you can't heal it.
684	So I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long.
687	This is a diabetic ulcer. It's tragic.
690	The treatment for this is amputation.
692	This is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes,
696	and has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact.
701	And this lady decided, after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer,
706	that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented.
709	That's what the wound looked like 11 weeks later.
712	That material contained only natural signals.
716	And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response
720	that it didn't have before.
722	There's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you --
725	I'll let you know when you can look again.
727	This is a horse. The horse is not in pain.
730	If the horse was in pain, I wouldn't show you this slide.
732	The horse just has another nostril that's developed
735	because of a riding accident.
737	Just a few weeks after treatment --
738	in this case, taking that material, turning it into a gel,
741	and packing that area, and then repeating the treatment a few times --
745	and the horse heals up.
747	And if you took an ultrasound of that area, it would look great.
749	Here's a dolphin where the fin's been re-attached.
752	There are now 400,000 patients around the world
755	who have used that material to heal their wounds.
758	Could you regenerate a limb?
761	DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project
765	to begin the process of asking that question.
768	And I'll show you the 15 million dollar picture.
771	This is a 78 year-old man who's lost the end of his fingertip.
774	Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips.
778	After treatment that's what it looks like.
781	This is happening today.
783	This is clinically relevant today.
786	There are materials that do this. Here are the heart patches.
789	But could you go a little further?
791	Could you, say, instead of using material,
793	can I take some cells along with the material,
795	and remove a damaged piece of tissue,
797	put a bio-degradable material on there?
800	You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish.
803	This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital.
808	He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish.
811	He chills the dish, it changes its properties
813	and he peels it right out of the dish.
815	It's the coolest stuff.
818	Now I'm going to show you cell-based regeneration.
820	And what I'm going to show you here
822	is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient.
826	Again, if you're squeamish, you don't want to watch.
828	But this one's kind of cool.
829	So this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had,
835	with a difference.
836	In this case, at the end of the bypass operation,
839	you're going to see the stem cells from the patient
841	that were removed at the beginning of the procedure
843	being injected directly into the heart of the patient.
847	And I'm standing up here because at one point
849	I'm going to show you just how early this technology is.
852	Here go the stem cells, right into the beating heart of the patient.
855	And if you look really carefully,
856	it's going to be right around this point
858	you'll actually see a back-flush.
860	You see the cells coming back out.
864	We need all sorts of new technology, new devices,
866	to get the cells to the right place at the right time.
871	Just a little bit of data, a tiny bit of data.
873	This was a randomized trial.
875	At this time this was an N of 20. Now there's an N of about 100.
879	Basically, if you take an extremely sick patient
881	and you give them a bypass, they get a little bit better.
883	If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass,
886	for these particular patients, they became asymptomatic.
889	These are now two years out.
893	The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early,
896	and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state.
900	This is the same procedure, but now done minimally invasively,
904	with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart
907	and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure.
911	There go the cells.
912	We don't have time to go into all of those details,
915	but basically, that works too.
917	You can take patients who are less sick,
920	and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state
924	through that kind of therapy.
926	Here's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet,
930	but I think very soon will be.
932	This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh,
934	along with a number of colleagues around the world.
936	They've decided that liposuction fluid,
939	which -- in the United States, we have a lot of liposuction fluid.
942	(Laughter)
943	It's a great source of stem cells.
945	Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid.
948	So you could go in, you could get your tummy-tuck.
951	Out comes the liposuction fluid,
953	and in this case, the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons.
958	All done in the lab.
959	And I think fairly soon, you will see patients being treated
962	with their own fat-derived, or adipose-derived, stem cells.
967	I talked before about the use of devices
969	to dramatically change the way we treat disease.
972	Here's just one example before I close up.
974	This is equally tragic.
976	We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership
979	with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army,
983	who have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq.
988	Many of those patients are very severely burned.
990	And if there's anything that's been learned about burn,
992	it's that we don't know how to treat it.
994	Everything that is done to treat burn --
996	basically we do a sodding approach.
999	We make something over here,
1001	and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound,
1003	and we try and get the two to take.
1005	In this case here, a new, wearable bio-reactor has been designed --
1009	it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR --
1012	by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh.
1014	And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed.
1017	The gun that you see there sprays cells.
1020	That's going to spray cells over that area.
1023	The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment,
1026	deliver other things as well at the same time,
1029	and therefore we will seed that lawn,
1032	as opposed to try the sodding approach.
1034	It's a completely different way of doing it.
1038	So my 18 minutes is up.
1040	So let me finish up with some good news,
1042	and maybe a little bit of bad news.
1045	The good news is that this is happening today.
1048	It's very powerful work.
1050	Clearly the images kind of get that across.
1052	It's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter-disciplinary.
1055	Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice
1059	is involved in trying to get this to happen.
1063	A number of governments, and a number of regions,
1065	have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease.
1068	The Japanese government were perhaps the first,
1070	when they decided to invest first 3 billion,
1073	later another 2 billion in this field.
1076	It's no coincidence.
1077	Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age.
1080	They need this to work or their health system dies.
1085	So they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area.
1089	The European Union, same thing.
1091	China, the same thing.
1093	China just launched a national tissue-engineering center.
1095	The first year budget was 250 million US dollars.
1099	In the United States we've had a somewhat different approach.
1103	(Laughter)
1106	Oh, for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president.
1110	We've had a different approach.
1111	And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along.
1115	But there's been no strategic investment
1118	to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way.
1124	And I'm going to finish up with a quote, maybe a little cheap shot,
1127	at the director of the NIH, who's a very charming man.
1133	Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard
1135	went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute
1140	just a few months ago,
1143	to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece
1148	of that 27.5 billion dollars that he's going to get next year
1152	and focus it, in a strategic way, to make sure we can accelerate the pace
1157	at which these things get to patients.
1160	And at the end of a very testy meeting,
1162	what the NIH director said was,
1164	"""Your vision is larger than our appetite."""
1166	I'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision,
1170	but together we can change his appetite.
1172	Thank you.
