12	Now I'm going to give you a story.
14	It's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey.
17	Let me begin with my parents.
20	I'm a product of this
22	visionary mother and father.
24	Many years ago, when I was born in the '50s --
27	'50s and '60s
29	didn't belong to girls in India.
31	They belonged to boys.
33	They belonged to boys who would join business
35	and inherit business from parents,
37	and girls would be dolled up to get married.
39	My family, in my city,
41	and almost in the country, was unique.
44	We were four of us, not one,
46	and fortunately no boys.
48	We were four girls and no boys.
50	And my parents were part
52	of a landed property family.
54	My father defied his own grandfather,
57	almost to the point of disinheritance,
59	because he decided to educate
61	all four of us.
63	He sent us to one of the best schools in the city
65	and gave us the best education.
67	As I've said, when we're born, we don't choose our parents,
70	and when we go to school, we don't choose our school.
72	Children don't choose a school.
74	They just get the school which parents choose for them.
76	So this is the foundation time which I got.
79	I grew up like this, and so did my other three sisters.
82	And my father used to say at that time,
84	"""I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world."""
87	I don't know if he really meant [that], but it happened.
90	I'm the only one who's left in India.
92	One is a British, another is an American
94	and the third is a Canadian.
96	So we are four of us in four corners of the world.
99	And since I said they're my role models,
102	I followed two things which my father and mother gave me.
105	"One, they said, ""Life is on an incline."
107	You either go up,
109	"or you come down."""
111	And the second thing, which has stayed with me,
113	which became my philosophy of life,
115	which made all the difference,
117	is: 100 things happen in your life, good or bad.
120	Out of 100, 90 are your creation.
122	They're good. They're your creation. Enjoy it.
125	If they're bad, they're your creation. Learn from it.
128	Ten are nature-sent over which you can't do a thing.
131	It's like a death of a relative,
133	or a cyclone, or a hurricane, or an earthquake.
136	You can't do a thing about it.
138	You've got to just respond to the situation.
140	But that response comes out of those 90 points.
143	Since I'm a product of this philosophy,
145	of 90/10,
147	"and secondly, ""life on an incline,"""
149	that's the way I grew up
151	to be valuing what I got.
154	I'm a product of opportunities,
156	rare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s,
158	which girls didn't get,
160	and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me
162	was something unique.
164	Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up
166	to get married with a lot of dowry,
168	and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school
171	and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities.
173	I thought I must tell you this.
175	Why I said this, is the background.
177	This is what comes next.
179	I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman,
182	a woman with indefatigable stamina,
184	because I used to run for my tennis titles, etc.
187	But I joined the Indian Police Service,
190	and then it was a new pattern of policing.
193	For me the policing stood for power to correct,
195	power to prevent and power to detect.
198	This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India --
201	the power to prevent.
203	Because normally it was always said, power to detect, and that's it,
205	or power to punish.
207	But I decided no, it's a power to prevent,
210	because that's what I learned when I was growing up.
212	How do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10?
215	So this was how it came into my service,
218	and it was different from the men.
220	I didn't want to make it different from the men, but it was different,
223	because this was the way I was different.
226	And I redefined policing concepts in India.
229	I'm going to take you on two journeys,
231	my policing journey and my prison journey.
233	What you see, if you see the title
236	"called ""PM's car held."""
238	This was the first time a prime minister of India
241	was given a parking ticket.
243	(Laughter)
245	That's the first time in India,
247	and I can tell you, that's the last time you're hearing about it.
250	It'll never happen again in India,
252	because now it was once and forever.
255	And the rule was, because I was sensitive,
257	I was compassionate, I was very sensitive to injustice,
260	and I was very pro-justice.
262	That's the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service.
264	I had other options, but I didn't choose them.
266	So I'm going to move on.
268	This is about tough policing, equal policing.
270	"Now I was known as ""here's a woman that's not going to listen."""
273	So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings,
275	postings which others would say no.
277	I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer.
280	Normally police officers don't want to do prison.
282	They sent me to prison to lock me up,
284	"thinking, ""Now there will be no cars"
286	and no VIPs to be given tickets to.
288	"Let's lock her up."""
290	Here I got a prison assignment.
292	This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals.
295	Obviously, it was.
297	But 10,000 men,
299	of which only 400 were women -- 10,000 --
302	9,000 plus about 600
304	were men.
306	Terrorists, rapists,
308	burglars, gangsters --
310	some of them I'd sent to jail
312	as a police officer outside.
314	And then how did I deal with them?
316	The first day when I went in,
318	I didn't know how to look at them.
320	"And I said, ""Do you pray?"" When I looked at the group, I said, ""Do you pray?"""
323	They saw me as a young, short woman wearing a pathan suit.
325	"I said, ""Do you pray?"""
327	And they didn't say anything.
329	"I said, ""Do you pray? Do you want to pray?"""
331	"They said, ""Yes."" I said, ""All right, let's pray."""
334	I prayed for them, and things started to change.
336	This is a visual of education inside the prison.
339	Friends, this has never happened,
341	where everybody in the prison studies.
343	I started this with community support.
345	Government had no budget.
347	It was one of the finest, largest volunteerism
349	in any prison in the world.
351	This was initiated in Delhi prison.
353	You see one sample
355	of a prisoner teaching a class.
358	These are hundreds of classes.
360	Nine to eleven, every prisoner went into the education program --
363	the same den in which they thought
365	they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten.
368	We converted this into an ashram --
370	from a prison to an ashram through education.
373	I think that's the bigger change.
375	It was the beginning of a change.
377	Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers.
380	Books came from donated schoolbooks.
382	Stationery was donated.
384	Everything was donated,
386	because there was no budget of education for the prison.
389	Now if I'd not done that,
391	it would have been a hellhole.
393	That's the second landmark.
395	I want to show you some moments of history in my journey,
397	which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world.
400	One, the numbers you'll never get to see.
402	Secondly, this concept.
404	This was a meditation program inside the prison
406	of over 1,000 prisoners.
408	One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation.
410	This was one of the most courageous steps
413	I took as a prison governor.
415	And this is what transformed.
417	You want to know more about this,
419	"go and see this film, ""Doing Time, Doing Vipassana."""
422	You will hear about it, and you will love it.
424	And write to me on KiranBedi.com,
426	and I'll respond to you.
428	Let me show you the next slide.
430	I took the same concept of mindfulness,
432	because, why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison?
435	Because crime is a product of a distorted mind.
438	It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control.
441	Not by preaching, not by telling,
443	not by reading, but by addressing your mind.
445	I took the same thing to the police,
447	because police, equally, were prisoners of their minds,
450	"and they felt as if it was ""we"" and ""they,"""
452	and that the people don't cooperate.
454	This worked.
456	This is a feedback box called a petition box.
458	This is a concept which I introduced
460	to listen to complaints, listen to grievances.
463	This was a magic box.
465	This was a sensitive box.
467	This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison.
470	If you see somebody in the blue --
472	yeah, this guy --
474	he was a prisoner, and he was a teacher.
476	And you see, everybody's busy. There was no time to waste.
479	Let me wrap it up.
481	I'm currently into movements,
483	movements of education
485	of the under-served children,
487	which is thousands -- India is all about thousands.
490	Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India.
492	That's a big way
494	we, as a small group of activists,
496	have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India.
499	Friends, you will hear a lot about it.
502	That's the movement at the moment I'm driving,
504	and that's the movement and ambition of my life.
507	Thank you very much.
509	(Applause)
511	Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
514	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
