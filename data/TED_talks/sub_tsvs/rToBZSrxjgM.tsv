13.672	I have spent the past 38 years
13.672	trying to be invisible.
19.83	I'm a copy editor.
21.807	I work at The New Yorker,
23.531	and copyediting for The New Yorker
23.531	is like playing shortstop
27.729	for a Major League Baseball team:
29.967	every little movement
29.967	gets picked over by the critics --
33.404	God forbid you should commit an error.
37.086	Just to clarify: copy editors don't choose
37.086	what goes into the magazine.
41.53	We work at the level of the sentence,
43.932	maybe the paragraph,
45.644	the words, the punctuation.
48.175	Our business is in the details.
50.904	We put the diaeresis, the double dot,
50.904	"over the ""i"" in ""naïve."""
56.591	We impose house style.
58.542	Every publication has a house style.
61.252	The New Yorker's
61.252	is particularly distinctive.
64.503	We sometimes get teased for our style.
67.307	Imagine -- we still spell
67.307	"""teen-ager"" with a hyphen,"
71.671	as if that word had just been coined.
74.919	"But you see that hyphen in ""teen-age"""
78.543	"and that diaeresis over ""coöperate,"""
81.159	and you know you're reading
81.159	The New Yorker.
83.85	Copyediting at The New Yorker
83.85	is a mechanical process.
87.372	There is a related role called
87.372	query proofreading,
90.595	or page-OK'ing.
92.959	Whereas copyediting is mechanical,
95.753	query proofreading is interpretive.
98.696	We make suggestions to the author
98.696	through the editor
102.092	to improve the emphasis of a sentence
104.737	or point out unintentional repetitions
107.395	and supply compelling alternatives.
112.502	Our purpose is to make
112.502	the author look good.
115.504	Note that we give our proofs
115.504	not directly to the author,
118.857	but to the editor.
120.4	This often creates
120.4	a good cop/bad cop dynamic
124.541	in which the copy editor -- I'll use that
124.541	as an umbrella term --
128.089	is invariably the bad cop.
132.008	If we do our job well, we're invisible,
134.469	but as soon as we make a mistake,
136.565	we copy editors become glaringly visible.
141.426	Here is the most recent mistake
141.426	that was laid at my door.
145.931	[Last Tuesday, Sarah Palin,
145.931	the pre-Trump embodiment
149.479	of populist no-nothingism
149.479	in the Republican Party,
152.649	endorsed Trump.]
154.935	"""Where were The New Yorker's fabled"
154.935	"copy editors?"" a reader wrote."
159.167	"""Didn't the writer mean"
159.167	"'know-nothingism'?"""
162.789	Ouch.
164.09	There's no excuse for this mistake.
166.786	"But I like it: ""no-nothingism."""
169.899	It might be American
169.899	"vernacular for ""nihilism."""
173.881	(Laughter)
177.112	Here, another reader quotes
177.112	a passage from the magazine:
180.16	[Ruby was seventy-six, but she retained
180.16	her authoritative bearing;
184.221	only her unsteady gait belied her age.]
188.77	He added:
189.945	"""Surely, someone at The New Yorker"
189.945	knows the meaning of 'belied,'
193.052	and that it is the opposite
193.052	of how it is used in this sentence.
196.284	"Come on! Get it together."""
198.648	Belie: to give a false impression.
202.18	"It should have been ""betrayed."""
205.426	E.B. White once wrote
205.426	of commas in The New Yorker:
208.325	"""They fall with the precision"
208.325	"of knives outlining a body."""
213.213	(Laughter)
214.939	And it's true -- we get a lot
214.939	of complaints about commas.
218.124	"""Are there really two commas"
218.124	"in 'Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard'?"""
222.746	There may not be on the sign, but yes,
222.746	"that is New Yorker style for ""Jr."""
228.192	One wag wrote:
230.181	"[""Please, could you expel,"
230.181	or, at least, restrain,
233.647	the comma-maniac,
233.647	"on your editorial staff?""]"
236.695	(Laughter)
238.071	Ah, well.
239.246	In this case, those commas
239.246	are well-placed,
241.514	except that there should not be one
243.409	"between ""maniac"" and ""on."""
245.435	(Laughter)
246.694	Also, if we must have commas
246.694	"around ""at least,"""
250.466	we might change it up
250.466	by using dashes around that phrase:
254.53	"""... -- or, at least, restrain --"""
258.392	Perfect.
259.586	(Applause)
261.188	Then there's this:
262.547	"""Love you, love your magazine,"
264.009	but can you please stop writing
264.009	"massive numbers as text?"""
269.23	[two and a half million ...]
270.808	No.
271.991	(Laughter)
274.053	One last cri de coeur
274.053	from a spelling stickler:
277.179	"[""Those long stringy things"
277.179	"are vocal cords, not chords.""]"
282.347	The outraged reader added,
284.52	"""I'm sure I'm not the first to write"
286.377	regarding this egregious
286.377	proofreading error,
289.622	but I'm equally sure I won't be the last.
292.052	"Fie!"""
293.296	(Laughter)
295.541	I used to like getting mail.
299.222	There is a pact
299.222	between writers and editors.
301.842	The editor never sells out the writer,
304.245	never goes public about bad jokes
304.245	that had to be cut
307.821	or stories that went on too long.
310.295	A great editor saves a writer
310.295	from her excesses.
315.558	Copy editors, too, have a code;
317.61	we don't advertise our oversights.
320.593	I feel disloyal divulging them here,
323.317	so let's have look at what we do right.
327.57	Somehow, I've gotten
327.57	a reputation for sternness.
331.133	But I work with writers who know
331.133	how to have their way with me.
335.741	"I've known Ian Frazier, or ""Sandy,"""
335.741	since the early 80s.
339.913	And he's one of my favorites,
341.566	even though he sometimes writes a sentence
344.035	that gives a copy editor pause.
346.846	Here is one from a story
346.846	about Staten Island
349.404	after Hurricane Sandy:
352.092	[A dock that had been broken
352.092	in the middle and lost its other half
356.125	sloped down toward the water,
358.533	its support pipes and wires
358.533	leaning forward
362.237	like when you open a box
362.237	of linguine and it slides out.]
366.072	(Laughter)
367.35	This would never have got past
367.35	the grammarian in the days of yore.
372.504	But what could I do?
373.767	"Technically, the ""like"" should be an ""as,"""
376.395	but it sounds ridiculous,
377.863	as if the author were about to embark
377.863	on an extended Homeric simile --
382.211	"""as when you open a box of linguine."""
385.395	(Laughter)
386.728	I decided that the hurricane
386.728	conferred poetic justice on Sandy
391.528	and let the sentence stand.
393.203	(Laughter)
394.314	Generally, if I think something is wrong,
396.346	I query it three times.
397.862	I told Sandy that not long ago
397.862	in a moment of indiscretion and he said,
401.741	"""Only three?"""
403.276	So, he has learned to hold out.
405.044	Recently, he wrote a story
405.044	"for ""Talk of the Town,"""
407.467	that's the section
407.467	at the front of the magazine
409.712	with short pieces on subjects
409.712	ranging from Ricky Jay's exhibit
412.814	at the Metropolitan Museum
414.383	to the introduction
414.383	of doggie bags in France.
417.578	Sandy's story was about
417.578	the return to the Bronx
420.02	of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.
422.711	There were three things
422.711	in it that I had to challenge.
425.284	First, a grammar query.
426.872	The justice was wearing black
426.872	and Sandy wrote,
429.491	[Her face and hands stood out
429.491	like in an old, mostly dark painting.]
435.043	Now, unlike with the hurricane,
437.017	"with this ""like,"" the author"
437.017	didn't have the excuse
439.509	of describing hurricane damage.
441.34	"""Like"" in this sense is a preposition,"
441.34	and a preposition takes an object,
445.66	which is a noun.
446.877	"This ""like"" had to be an ""as."""
449.433	"""As in an old, mostly dark painting."""
452.615	Second, a spelling issue.
454.289	The author was quoting someone
454.289	who was assisting the justice:
457.986	"[""It will be just a minute."
459.432	"We are getting the justice mic'ed,""]"
463.434	Mic'ed?
464.982	"The music industry spells it ""mic"""
467.003	because that's how it's spelled
467.003	on the equipment.
469.385	I'd never seen it used
469.385	as a verb with this spelling,
471.836	and I was distraught
471.836	"to think that ""mic'ed"""
474.39	would get into the magazine on my watch.
476.699	(Laughter)
477.734	"New Yorker style for ""microphone"""
477.734	"in its abbreviated form is ""mike."""
482.519	Finally, there was a sticky
482.519	grammar and usage issue
485.17	in which the pronoun has to have
485.17	the same grammatical number
488.908	as its antecedent.
491.292	[everyone in the vicinity
491.292	held their breath]
495.491	"""Their"" is plural and ""everyone,"""
495.491	its antecedent, is singular.
499.71	You would never say,
499.71	"""Everyone were there."""
502.672	Everyone was there. Everyone is here.
506.537	But people say things like,
506.537	"""Everyone held their breath"" all the time."
510.175	To give it legitimacy,
511.418	copy editors call it
511.418	"""the singular 'their,'"""
514.865	as if calling it singular
514.865	makes it no longer plural.
517.954	(Laughter)
519.372	It is my job when I see it in print
519.372	to do my best to eliminate it.
525.37	I couldn't make it,
525.37	"""Everyone held her breath,"""
527.872	"or ""Everyone held his breath,"""
529.588	"or ""Everyone held his or her breath."""
532.174	Whatever I suggested had to blend in.
535.018	I asked, through the editor,
536.398	if the author would consider changing it
538.47	"to ""All in the vicinity"
538.47	"held their breath,"""
541.065	"because ""all"" is plural."
542.931	Nope.
544.112	"I tried again: ""All those present"
544.112	"held their breath?"""
547.366	I thought this sounded vaguely judicial.
549.611	But the editor pointed out
550.882	"that we could not have ""present"""
550.882	"and ""presence"""
553.311	in the same sentence.
555.108	When the final proof came back,
556.711	"the author had accepted ""as"" for ""like,"""
559.311	"and ""miked"" for ""mic'ed."""
561.27	"But on ""Everyone held their breath,"""
561.27	he stood his ground.
565.49	Two out of three isn't bad.
568.01	In the same issue,
569.277	in that piece on doggie bags in France,
571.823	there was the gratuitous use
571.823	of the f-word by a Frenchman.
576.26	I wonder, when the mail comes in,
578.888	which will have offended the readers more.
581.77	(Laughter)
583.467	Thank you.
584.642	(Applause)
