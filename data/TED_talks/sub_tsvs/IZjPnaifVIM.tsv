13.841	So I thought I'd talk about identity.
15.627	That's sort of an interesting
15.627	enough topic to me.
18.06	And the reason was,
18.06	because when I was asked to do this,
21.238	I'd just read, in one of the papers,
21.238	I can't remember,
24.801	something from someone at Facebook
24.801	saying, well,
28.204	"""we need to make everybody"
28.204	"use their real names."""
29.844	and then that's basically
29.844	all the problems solved.
32.202	And that's so wrong,
34.147	that's such a fundamentally,
34.147	reactionary view of identity,
38.09	and it's going to get us
38.09	into all sorts of trouble.
40.495	And so what I thought I'd do
41.853	is I'll explain four
41.853	sort of problems about it,
45.858	and then I'll suggest a solution,
47.821	which hopefully you
47.821	might find interesting.
49.893	So just to frame the problem,
51.944	what does authenticity mean?
53.534	That's me, that's
53.534	a camera phone picture of me
58.624	looking at a painting.
59.604	[What's the Problem?]
60.369	That's a painting that was painted
61.501	by a very famous forger,
63.543	and because I'm not very good
63.543	at presentations,
65.806	I already can't remember the name
65.806	that I wrote on my card.
68.545	And he was incarcerated
68.545	in, I think, Wakefield Prison
72.423	for forging masterpieces by,
72.423	I think, French Impressionists.
75.989	And he's so good at it,
75.989	that when he was in prison,
79.168	everybody in prison,
79.168	the governor and whatever,
80.544	wanted him to paint masterpieces
80.544	to put on the walls,
83.391	because they were so good.
84.683	And so that's a masterpiece,
86.067	which is a fake of a masterpiece,
88.066	and bonded into the canvas is a chip
88.066	which identifies that as a real fake,
94.729	if you see what I mean.
96.261	(Laughter)
97.453	So when we're talking about authenticity,
99.696	it's a little more fractal than it appears
99.696	and that's a good example to show it.
105.158	I tried to pick four problems
105.158	that will frame the issue properly.
109.139	So the first problem, I thought,
110.687	Chip and PIN, right?
112.239	[Banks and legacies
112.239	bringing down the system from within]
113.753	[Offline solutions do not work online]
114.625	I'm guessing everyone's got
114.625	a chip and PIN card, right?
117.241	So why is that a good example?
119.007	That's the example of how
119.007	legacy thinking about identity
122.482	subverts the security
122.482	of a well-constructed system.
125.4	That chip and PIN card
125.4	that's in your pocket
128.191	has a little chip on it
128.191	that cost millions of pounds to develop,
131.433	is extremely secure,
133.01	you can put scanning
133.01	electron microscopes on it,
135.273	you can try and grind it down,
135.273	blah blah blah.
137.449	Those chips have never been broken,
137.449	whatever you read in the paper.
140.938	And for a joke,
140.938	we take that super-secure chip
144.172	and we bond it to a trivially
144.172	counterfeitable magnetic stripe
147.686	and for very lazy criminals,
147.686	we still emboss the card.
151.308	So if you're a criminal in a hurry
151.308	and you need to copy someone's card,
154.815	you can just stick a piece of paper on it
154.815	and rub a pencil over it
157.016	just to sort of speed things up.
158.899	And even more amusingly,
158.899	and on my debit card too,
161.995	we print the name and the SALT code
161.995	and everything else on the front too.
164.386	Why?
167.725	There is no earthly reason why your name
167.725	is printed on a chip and PIN card.
171.834	And if you think about it,
173.469	it's even more insidious and perverse
173.469	than it seems at first.
176.587	Because the only people that benefit
178.401	from having the name
178.401	on the card are criminals.
180.975	You know what your name is, right?
182.616	(Laughter)
183.517	And when you go into
183.517	a shop and buy something,
185.769	it's a PIN, he doesn't care
185.769	what the name is.
188.729	The only place where you ever have
188.729	to write your name on the back
191.388	is in America at the moment.
192.558	And whenever I go to America,
193.769	and I have to pay with a mag stripe
193.769	on the back of the card,
195.569	I always sign it Carlos Tethers anyway,
197.451	just as a security mechanism,
199.259	because if a transaction
199.259	ever gets disputed,
201.497	and it comes back and it says Dave Birch,
203.474	I know it must have been a criminal,
205.213	because I would never sign it Dave Birch.
208.048	(Laughter)
209.738	So if you drop your card in the street,
211.529	it means a criminal
211.529	can pick it up and read it.
213.301	They know the name,
214.006	from the name they can find the address,
215.935	and then they can go off
215.935	and buy stuff online.
218.35	Why do we put the name on the card?
220.562	Because we think identity
220.562	is something to do with names,
224.281	and because we're rooted
224.281	in the idea of the identity card,
227.976	which obsesses us.
229.092	And I know it crashed and burned
229.092	a couple of years ago,
231.688	but if you're someone in politics
231.688	or the home office or whatever,
236.243	and you think about identity,
237.648	you can only think of identity
237.648	in terms of cards with names on them.
240.863	And that's very subversive
240.863	in a modern world.
244.009	So the second example I thought I'd use
246.265	is chatrooms.
248.331	[Chatrooms and Children]
249.135	I'm very proud of that picture,
249.135	that's my son
251.325	playing in his band with his friends
251.325	for the first-ever gig,
255.401	I believe you call it, where he got paid.
257.37	(Laughter)
258.157	And I love that picture.
260.035	I like the picture of him
260.035	getting into medical school a lot better,
262.801	(Laughter)
263.501	I like that picture for the moment.
265.614	Why do I use that picture?
266.589	Because that was very interesting,
266.589	watching that experience as an old person.
271.678	So him and his friends,
273.121	they get together, they booked a room,
273.121	like a church hall,
275.999	and they got all their friends
275.999	who had bands,
277.849	and they got them together,
279.159	and they do it all on Facebook,
280.66	and then they sell tickets,
280.66	and the first band on the -
284.458	"I was going to say ""menu,"""
285.343	that's probably
285.343	the wrong word for it, isn't it?
287.653	The first band on the list of bands
289.583	that appears at some
289.583	public music performance of some kind
294.14	gets the sales from the first 20 tickets,
296.309	then the next band gets the next 20,
298.129	and so on.
299.115	They were at the bottom of the menu,
300.451	they were like fifth,
300.451	I thought they had no chance.
302.569	He actually got 20 quid. Fantastic, right?
304.831	But my point is,
304.831	that all worked perfectly,
306.928	except on the web.
309.709	So they're sitting on Facebook,
311.902	and they're sending these messages
311.902	and arranging things
314.768	and they don't know who anybody is, right?
317.087	That's the big problem
317.087	we're trying to solve.
318.718	If only they were using the real names,
320.685	Then you wouldn't be worried
320.685	about them on the Internet.
323.376	And so when he says to me,
324.621	"""Oh, I want to go to a chatroom"
324.621	"to talk about guitars"" or something,"
328.987	"I'm like, ""oh, well,"
328.987	I don't want you to go into a chatroom
332.236	to talk about guitars, because
332.236	they might not all be your friends,
335.594	and some of the people
335.594	that are in the chatroom
337.857	might be perverts and teachers
337.857	"and vicars."""
341.414	(Laughter)
343.239	I mean, they generally are,
343.239	when you look in the paper, right?
346.168	So I want to know who
346.168	all the people in the chatroom are.
349.224	So okay, you can go in the chatroom,
350.963	but only if everybody in the chatroom
350.963	is using their real names,
353.987	and they submit full copies
353.987	of their police report.
358.352	But of course, if anybody
358.352	in the chatroom asked for his real name,
361.472	I'd say no.
361.472	You can't give them your real name.
363.714	Because what happens
363.714	if they turn out to be perverts,
366.414	and teachers and whatever.
369.087	So you have this odd sort of paradox
370.826	where I'm happy for him
370.826	to go into this space
373.157	if I know who everybody else is,
375.099	but I don't want anybody else
375.099	to know who he is.
377.462	And so you get
377.462	this sort of logjam around identity
379.638	where you want full disclosure
379.638	from everybody else,
381.274	but not from yourself.
382.569	And there's no progress, we get stuck.
384.576	And so the chatroom thing
384.576	doesn't work properly,
386.886	and it's a very bad way
386.886	of thinking about identity.
391.251	So on my RSS feed,
391.251	I saw this thing about -
394.186	I just said something bad
394.186	about my RSS feed, didn't I?
396.782	I should stop saying it like that.
398.537	For some random reason, I can't imagine,
400.07	something about cheerleaders
400.07	turned up in my inbox.
402.226	And I read this story about cheerleaders,
404.203	and it's a fascinating story.
405.652	This happened a couple of years ago
405.652	in the U.S.
407.867	There were some cheerleaders
407.867	in a team at a high school
410.592	in the U.S., and they said mean things
413.475	about their cheerleading coach,
414.661	as I'm sure kids do
414.661	about all of their teachers
416.872	all of the time,
418.199	and somehow the cheerleading coach
418.199	found out about this.
420.279	She was very upset.
421.743	And so she went to one of the girls,
421.743	and said,
423.91	"""you have to give me"
423.91	"your Facebook password."""
426.03	I read this all the time,
426.03	where even at some universities
429.719	and places of education,
430.619	kids are forced to hand over
430.619	their Facebook passwords.
432.348	So you've got to give them
432.348	your Facebook password.
435.103	She was a kid!
435.976	What she should have said
437.162	"is, ""my lawyer will be calling you"
438.392	first thing in the morning.
439.182	It's an outrageous imposition
441.303	on my 4th Amendment right to privacy,
443.162	and you're going to be sued
443.947	"for all the money you've got."""
444.542	That's what she should have said.
445.598	But she's a kid,
446.577	so she hands over the password.
448.396	The teacher can't log into Facebook,
450.446	because the school
450.446	has blocked access to Facebook.
453.618	So the teacher can't log into Facebook
453.618	until she gets home.
455.531	So the girl tells her friends,
457.229	guess what happened?
457.79	The teacher logged in, she knows.
459.386	So the girls just all logged into Facebook
459.386	on their phones,
461.227	and deleted their profiles.
463.094	And so when the teacher logged in,
463.094	there was nothing there.
465.979	My point is, those identities,
465.979	they don't think about them the same way.
471.631	Identity is, especially when
471.631	you're a teenager, a fluid thing.
475.36	You have lots of identities.
476.965	And you can have an identity,
476.965	you don't like it,
479.215	because it's subverted in some way,
479.215	or it's insecure, or it's inappropriate,
482.811	you just delete it and get another one.
484.893	The idea that you have an identity
484.893	that's given to you by someone,
488.217	the government or whatever,
489.036	and you have to stick with that identity
489.036	and use it in all places,
491.155	that's absolutely wrong.
492.863	Why would you want to really know
492.863	who someone was on Facebook,
495.895	unless you wanted to abuse them
495.895	and harass them in some way?
498.777	And it just doesn't work properly.
501.408	And my fourth example is
501.408	there are some cases
503.622	where you really want to be -
506.055	In case you're wondering,
506.055	that's me at the G20 protest.
509.625	I wasn't actually at the G20 protest,
509.625	but I had a meeting at a bank
513.301	on the day of the G20 protest,
513.301	and I got an email from the bank
516.734	saying please don't wear a suit,
516.734	because it'll inflame the protesters.
521.295	I look pretty good in a suit, frankly,
523.069	so you can see why it would drive them
524.759	into an anti-capitalist frenzy.
526.26	(Laughter)
526.795	So I thought, well, look.
527.724	If I don't want to inflame the protesters,
530.893	the obvious thing to do
531.809	is go dressed as a protester.
533.214	So I went dressed completely in black,
535.232	you know, with a black balaclava,
537.116	I had black gloves on,
537.95	but I've taken them off
537.95	to sign the visitor's book.
539.587	(Laughter)
540.159	I'm wearing black trousers, black boots,
542.342	I'm dressed completely in black.
543.748	I go into the bank at 10 o'clock,
544.922	"go, ""Hi, I'm Dave Birch,"
545.887	I've got a 3 o'clock
545.887	"with so and so there."""
547.163	Sure. They sign me in.
548.604	There's my visitor's badge.
551.375	(Laughter)
552.266	So this nonsense
553.584	about you've got to have real names
553.584	on Facebook and whatever,
555.638	that gets you that kind of security.
557.873	That gets you security theater,
557.873	where there's no actual security,
562.392	but people are sort of playing parts
562.392	in a play about security.
565.73	And as long as
565.73	everybody learns their lines,
566.855	everyone's happy.
568.391	But it's not real security.
571.255	Especially because I hate banks
571.255	more than the G20 protesters do,
574.497	because I work for them.
575.682	I know that things are actually worse
575.682	than these guys think.
578.509	(Laughter)
581.872	But suppose I worked
581.872	next to somebody in a bank
586.966	who was doing something.
596.744	Suppose I was sitting
596.744	next to a rogue trader,
598.934	and I want to report it
598.934	to the boss of the bank.
601.237	So I log on to do
601.237	a little bit of whistleblowing.
602.653	I send a message,
602.653	this guy's a rogue trader.
605.118	That message is meaningless
606.916	if you don't know
606.916	that I'm a trader at the bank.
609.864	If that message just comes from anybody,
611.793	it has zero information value.
614.45	There's no point in sending that message.
618.463	But if I have to prove who I am,
621.23	I'll never send that message.
622.635	It's just like the nurse in the hospital
622.635	reporting the drunk surgeon.
626.488	That message will only happen
626.488	if I'm anonymous.
629.409	So the system has to have ways
629.409	of providing anonymity there,
634.2	otherwise we don't get
634.2	where we want to get to.
636.463	So four issues.
636.463	So what are we going to do about it?
639.133	Well, what we tend to do about it
643.82	is we think about Orwell space.
646.208	And we try to make electronic versions
649.354	of the identity card
649.354	that we got rid of in 1953.
651.661	So we think if we had a card,
654.418	call it a Facebook login,
655.757	which proves who you are,
657.054	and I make you carry it all the time,
658.945	that solves the problem.
659.763	And of course, for all those reasons
659.763	I've just outlined,
661.921	it doesn't, and it might, actually,
662.913	make some problems worse.
663.985	The more times you're forced
663.985	to use your real identity,
666.808	certainly in transactional terms,
669.048	the more likely that identity
669.048	is to get stolen and subverted.
671.93	The goal is to stop people
671.93	from using identity
674.194	in transactions which don't need identity,
676.371	which is actually almost all transactions.
678.88	Almost all of the transactions you do
681.177	are not, who are you?
682.865	They're, are you allowed to drive the car,
684.999	are you allowed in the building,
686.547	are you over 18,
687.404	etcetera, etcetera.
689.519	So my suggestion-I, like James,
691.35	think that there should be
691.35	a resurgence of interest in R &amp; D.
694.511	I think this is a solvable problem.
695.296	It's something we can do about.
697.116	Naturally, in these circumstances,
699.064	I turn to Doctor Who.
700.438	Because in this,
702.574	as in so many other walks of life,
704.218	Doctor Who has already shown
704.218	us the answer.
707.171	So I should say,
707.985	for some of our foreign visitors,
710.316	Doctor Who is the greatest
710.316	living scientist in England,
714.17	(Laughter)
715.747	and a beacon of truth and enlightenment
715.747	to all of us.
718.547	And this is Doctor Who
718.547	with his psychic paper.
722.617	Come on, you guys must have seen
722.617	Doctor Who's psychic paper.
724.787	You're not nerds if you say yes.
726.787	Who's seen Doctor Who's psychic paper?
728.923	Oh right, you were in the library
728.923	the whole time studying I guess.
731.353	Is that what you're going to tell us?
733.423	Doctor Who's psychic paper
734.685	is when you hold up the psychic paper,
736.805	the person, in their brain,
738.343	sees the thing that they need to see.
740.692	So I want to show you a British passport,
743.051	I hold up the psychic paper,
744.077	you see a British passport.
745.557	I want to get into a party,
747.353	I hold up the psychic paper,
748.96	I show you a party invitation.
750.413	You see what you want to see.
752.488	So what I'm saying is we need
752.488	to make an electronic version of that,
755.703	but with one tiny, tiny change,
757.9	which is that it'll only show you
757.9	the British passport
760.496	if I've actually got one.
761.712	It'll only show you the party invitation
762.931	if I actually have one.
764.328	It will only show you that I'm over 18
764.328	if I actually am over 18.
767.352	But nothing else.
769.676	So you're the bouncer at the pub,
769.676	you need to know that I'm over 18,
774.451	instead of showing you my driving license,
776.475	which shows you I know how to drive,
778.316	what my name is, my address,
778.316	all these kind of things,
780.912	I show you my psychic paper,
782.491	and all it tells you is
782.491	am I over 18 or not.
785.657	Right.
787.093	Is that just a pipe dream?
788.431	Of course not, otherwise
788.431	I wouldn't be here talking to you.
790.124	So in order to build that
790.124	and make it work,
793.208	I'm only going to name these things,
793.208	I'll not go into them,
795.979	we need a plan,
797.156	which is we're going to build this
798.405	as an infrastructure for everybody to use,
800.429	to solve all of these problems.
802.283	We're going to make a utility,
804.331	the utility has to be universal,
805.879	you can use it everywhere,
806.762	I'm just giving you little flashes
806.762	of the technology as we go along.
809.977	That's a Japanese ATM,
811.36	the fingerprint template
811.36	is stored inside the mobile phone.
814.468	So when you want to draw money out,
815.455	you put the mobile phone on the ATM,
816.952	and touch your finger,
818.217	your fingerprint goes through
818.217	to the phone,
820.289	the phone says yes, that's whoever,
821.98	and the ATM then gives you some money.
824.184	It has to be a utility
824.184	that you can use everywhere.
827.221	It has to be absolutely convenient,
829.007	that's me going into the pub.
832.174	All the device on the door
832.174	of the pub is allowed is,
834.967	is this person over 18
834.967	and not barred from the pub?
838.64	And so the idea is,
838.64	you touch your ID card to the door,
841.97	and if I am allowed in,
841.97	it shows my picture,
843.929	if I'm not allowed in,
843.929	it shows a red cross.
845.39	It doesn't disclose any other information.
847.005	It has to have no special gadgets.
848.917	That can only mean one thing,
850.552	following on from Ross's statement,
852.243	which I agree with completely.
853.721	If it means no special gadgets,
854.833	it has to run on a mobile phone.
856.207	That's the only choice we have,
857.31	we have to make it work on mobile phones.
859.189	There are 6.6 billion
860.123	mobile phone subscriptions.
861.047	My favorite statistic of all time,
863.083	only 4 billion toothbrushes in the world.
865.06	That means something,
866.119	I don't know what.
867.376	(Laughter)
867.754	I rely on our futurologists to tell me.
871.217	It has to be a utility
871.217	which is extensible.
872.927	So it has to be something
874.212	that anybody could build on.
875.802	Anybody should be able
875.802	to use this infrastructure,
877.69	you don't need permissions,
877.69	licenses, whatever,
880.144	anyone should be able
880.144	to write some code to do this.
885.176	You know what symmetry is,
886.441	so you don't need a picture of it.
888.788	This is how we're going to do it.
889.952	We're going to do it using phones,
890.986	and we're going to do it
891.612	using mobile proximity.
892.768	I'm going to suggest to you
893.904	the technology to implement
895.24	Doctor Who's psychic paper
896.526	is already here, and if any of you
898.17	have got one of the new
898.17	Barclay's debit cards
900.649	with the contactless interface on it,
901.878	you've already got that technology.
903.569	If you've ever been up to the big city,
905.493	and used an Oyster card at all,
906.994	does that ring any bells to anybody?
909.089	The technology already exists.
909.835	The first phones
911.225	that have the technology built in,
911.855	the Google Nexus, the S2,
914.154	the Samsung Wifi 7.9,
914.863	the first phones that have
916.355	the technology built into them
917.447	are already in the shops.
918.281	So the idea that the gas man
919.993	can turn up at my mom's door
922.185	and he can show my mom his phone,
924.387	and she can tap it with her phone,
925.722	and it will come up with green
925.722	if he really is from British Gas
928.029	and allowed in,
929.241	and it'll come up with red if he isn't,
930.911	end of story.
931.521	We have the technology to do that.
933.371	And what's more,
934.606	although some of those things
934.606	sounded a bit counter-intuitive,
936.751	like proving I'm over 18
936.751	without proving who I am,
939.539	the cryptography to do that
939.539	not only exists,
941.764	it's extremely well-known
941.764	and well-understood.
943.993	Digital signatures, the blinding
943.993	of public key certificates,
946.648	these technologies have been around
946.648	for a while,
948.392	we've just had no way
948.392	of packaging them up.
950.464	So the technology already exists.
953.181	We know it works,
956.869	There are a few examples
956.869	of the technology being used
958.617	in experimental places.
960.287	That's London Fashion Week,
961.615	where we built a system with O2,
963.489	that's for the Wireless Festival
963.489	in Hyde Park,
966.256	you can see the persons
967.379	walking in with their VIP band,
969.14	it's just being checked
969.624	by the Nokia phone
969.624	that's reading the band.
970.724	I'm only putting those up to show you
972.422	these things are prosaic,
973.651	this stuff works in these environments.
975.533	They don't need to be special.
976.986	So finally, I know that you can do this,
983.789	because if you saw
983.789	the episode of Doctor Who,
986.693	the Easter special of Doctor Who,
988.593	where he went to Mars in a bus,
991.969	I should say again
991.969	for our foreign students,
993.531	that doesn't happen every episode.
995.204	This was a very special case.
996.675	So in the episode where
996.675	he goes to Mars in a London bus,
999.916	I can't show you the clip,
1001.589	due to the outrageous restrictions
1001.589	of Queen Anne-style copyright
1004.613	by the BBC,
1006.506	but in the episode
1006.506	where he goes to Mars in a London bus,
1009.245	Doctor Who is clearly shown
1009.245	getting on to the bus
1013.379	with the Oyster card reader
1014.679	using his psychic paper.
1016.247	Which proves that psychic paper
1018.339	has an MSE interface.
1020.054	Thank you very much.
