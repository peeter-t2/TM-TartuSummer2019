12.724	Women represent
17.574	and professional positions,
20.363	but the percentages of women
20.363	at the top of organizations
23.491	represent not even a third of that number.
26.315	So some people hear that statistic and they ask,
29.82	why do we have so few women leaders?
33.323	But I look at that statistic
35.246	and, if you, like me, believe
38.02	that leadership manifests at every level,
41.8	you would see that there's a tremendous,
44.786	awesome resource of leaders
47.767	who are leading in middle management,
50.523	which raises a different question:
53.639	Why are there so many women
55.889	mired in the middle
57.88	and what has to happen
59.702	to take them to the top?
62.245	So some of you might be some of those women
64.764	who are in middle management
66.587	and seeking to move up in your organization.
70.513	Well, Tonya is a great example
70.513	of one of these women.
74.135	I met her two years ago.
75.834	She was a vice president in a Fortune 50 company,
79.17	and she said to me with a sense of deep frustration,
83.393	"""I've worked really hard to improve my confidence"
86.791	and my assertiveness and develop a great brand,
90.154	I get terrific performance evals from my boss,
93.979	my 360s in the organization let me know
97.218	that my teams love working for me,
100.515	I've taken every management course that I can here,
104.351	I am working with a terrific mentor,
106.916	and yet I've been passed over
109.334	twice for advancement opportunities,
112.507	even when my manager knows
114.79	that I'm committed to moving up
116.601	and even interested in an international assignment.
121.236	I don't understand why
123.148	"I'm being passed over."""
125.117	So what Tonya doesn't realize
127.345	is that there's a missing 33 percent
130.369	of the career success equation for women,
133.99	and it's understanding what this missing 33 percent is
137.815	that's required to close the gender gap at the top.
142.529	In order to move up in organizations,
145.543	you have to be known for your leadership skills,
148.162	and this would apply to any of you,
149.741	women or men.
152.29	It means that you have to be recognized
155.294	for using the greatness in you
157.971	to achieve and sustain extraordinary outcomes
161.222	by engaging the greatness in others.
164.901	Put in other language,
166.291	it means you have to use your skills
168.309	and talents and abilities
170.705	to help the organization achieve
173.113	its strategic financial goals
176.262	and do that by working effectively with others
179.907	inside of the organization and outside.
183.901	And although all three of these elements
186.196	of leadership are important,
188.232	when it comes to moving up in organizations,
190.931	they aren't equally important.
192.788	So pay attention to the green box
195.533	as I move forward.
199.548	In seeking and identifying
202.34	employees with high potential,
204.357	the potential to go to the top of organizations,
209.006	the skills and competencies
212.4	that relate to that green box
214.38	are rated twice as heavily
216.753	as those in the other two elements of leadership.
220.567	These skills and competencies
222.637	can be summarized as business,
225.337	strategic, and financial acumen.
228.509	In other words, this skill set has to do
231.17	with understanding where the organization is going,
235.483	what its strategy is,
237.621	what financial targets it has in place,
240.14	and understanding your role
241.57	in moving the organization forward.
244.247	This is that missing 33 percent
248.445	of the career success equation for women,
251.425	not because it's missing in our capabilities
253.978	or abilities,
255.598	but because it's missing in the advice
257.724	that we're given.
259.378	Here's what I mean by that.
261.147	Five years ago, I was asked to moderate
263.338	a panel of executives,
265.171	and the topic for the evening was
267.16	"""What do you look for in "
267.16	"high-potential employees?"""
270.538	So think about the three elements of leadership
273.62	as I summarize for you what they told me.
276.41	"They said, ""We look for people"
278.907	who are smart and hard working and committed
282.563	"and trustworthy and resilient."""
286.669	So which element of leadership does that relate to?
290.503	Personal greatness.
292.519	"They said, ""We look for employees"
295.2	who are great with our customers,
297.529	who empower their teams,
299.723	who negotiate effectively,
301.781	who are able to manage conflict well,
304.324	"and are overall great communicators."""
307.564	Which element of leadership does that equate to?
310.874	Engaging the greatness in others.
313.683	And then they pretty much stopped.
315.889	So I asked,
317.12	"""Well, what about people"
319.17	who understand your business,
321.534	where it's going,
322.94	and their role in taking it there?
325.55	And what about people who are able
326.866	to scan the external environment,
329.375	identify risks and opportunities,
332.176	make strategy or make strategic recommendations?
336.595	And what about people who are able
338.98	to look at the financials of your business,
341.558	understand the story that the financials tell,
345.202	and either take appropriate action
347.47	"or make appropriate recommendations?"""
350.209	And to a man, they said,
352.155	"""That's a given."""
354.347	So I turned to the audience
355.945	of 150 women and I asked,
358.976	"""How many of you have ever been told"
361.878	that the door-opener for career advancement
364.837	is your business, strategic and financial acumen,
368.616	and that all the other important stuff
371.04	"is what differentiates you in the talent pool?"""
374.837	Three women raised their hand,
377.965	and I've asked this question of women
380.1	all around the globe in the five years since,
382.644	and the percentage is never much different.
387.358	So this is obvious, right?
389.495	But how can it be?
391.407	Well, there are primarily three reasons
393.443	that there's this missing 33 percent
395.466	in the career success advice given to women?
399.101	When organizations direct women
401.63	toward resources
403.497	that focus on the conventional advice
405.83	that we've been hearing for over 40 years,
407.798	there's a notable absence of advice that relates
411.804	to business, strategic and financial acumen.
414.952	Much of the advice is emphasizing
417.787	personal actions that we need to take,
419.621	like become more assertive, become more confident,
422.321	develop your personal brand,
424.03	things that Tonya's been working on,
426.854	and advice about working with other people,
429.381	things like learn to self-promote,
432.2	get a mentor, enhance your network,
434.365	and virtually nothing said
436.997	about the importance of business, strategic
439.07	and financial acumen.
441.294	This doesn't mean that this advice is unimportant.
445.397	What it means is that this is advice
448.111	that's absolutely essential for breaking through
451.115	from career start to middle management,
455.513	but it's not the advice
457.257	that gets women to break through
459.507	from the middle, where we're 50 percent,
461.824	to senior and executive positions.
464.377	And this is why conventional advice to women
467.437	in 40 years hasn't closed the gender gap at the top
471.532	and won't close it.
474.434	Now, the second reason
476.279	relates to Tonya's comments
477.967	about having had excellent performance evals,
482.418	great feedback from her teams,
485.069	and having taken every management training program
487.686	she can lay her hands on.
489.756	So you would think that she's getting
492.708	messages from her organization
495.064	through the talent development systems
497.271	and performance management systems
499.745	that let her know how important it is
501.68	to develop business, strategic and financial acumen,
505.141	but here again, that green square is quite small.
509.746	On average,
511.523	talent and performance management systems
513.829	in the organizations that I've worked with
516.383	focus three to one
518.858	on the other two elements of leadership
521.186	compared to the importance of business,
523.672	strategic and financial acumen,
526.203	which is why typical talent and performance systems
530.748	haven't closed and won't close
532.711	the gender gap at the top.
535.968	Now, Tonya also talked about working with a mentor,
539.84	and this is really important to talk about,
542.279	because if organizations,
543.9	talent and performance systems
545.754	aren't giving people in general
547.571	information about the importance of
550.187	business, strategic and financial acumen,
552.527	how are men getting to the top?
554.744	Well, there are primarily two ways.
557.263	One is because of the positions
559.13	they're guided into,
561.222	and the other is because of informal mentoring
564.193	and sponsorship.
565.947	So what's women's experience
567.702	as it relates to mentoring?
569.907	Well, this comment from an executive
572.809	that I worked with recently
574.586	illustrates that experience.
576.611	He was very proud of the fact that last year,
579.266	he had two protégés: a man and a woman.
583.25	"And he said, ""I helped the woman build confidence,"
586.927	I helped the man learn the business,
589.346	and I didn't realize that I was treating them
591.753	"any differently."""
593.227	And he was sincere about that.
595.645	So what this illustrates is that
597.84	as managers, whether we're women or men,
600.23	we have mindsets about women and men,
602.26	about careers in leadership,
604.127	and these unexamined mindsets
607.15	won't close the gender gap at the top.
610.922	So how do we take this idea
612.67	of the missing 33 percent
614.713	and turn it into action?
616.884	Well, for women, the answer is obvious:
620.281	we have to begin to focus more
622.554	on developing and demonstrating
624.491	the skills we have
626.19	that show that we're people who understand
628.639	our businesses, where they're headed,
630.912	and our role in taking it there.
633.33	That's what enables that breakthrough
635.726	from middle management
637.999	to leadership at the top.
640.867	But you don't have to be a middle manager to do this.
643.23	One young scientist that works in a biotech firm
646.931	used her insight about the missing 33 percent
651.3	to weave financial impact data
654.412	into a project update she did
656.402	and got tremendous positive feedback
658.742	from the managers in the room.
661.364	So we don't want to put 100 percent
663.614	of the responsibility on women's shoulders,
667.123	nor would it be wise to do so, and here's why:
671.443	In order for companies to achieve
673.209	their strategic financial goals,
675.886	executives understand that they have to have
677.844	everyone pulling in the same direction.
680.6	In other words, the term we use in business is,
683.142	we have to have strategic alignment.
685.801	And executives know this very well,
688.952	and yet only 37 percent,
691.281	according to a recent Conference Board report,
693.901	believe that they have that
695.499	strategic alignment in place.
698.222	So for 63 percent of organizations,
701.9	achieving their strategic financial goals
704.217	is questionable.
705.973	And if you think about what I've just shared,
709.156	that you have situations where at least 50 percent
712.126	of your middle managers
713.847	haven't received clear messaging
716.446	that they have to become focused on the business,
720.23	where it's headed, and their role in taking it there,
722.768	it's not surprising that that percentage
724.86	of executives who are confident about alignment
727.24	is so low,
728.937	which is why there are other people
731.906	who have a role to play in this.
734.292	It's important for directors on boards
737.757	to expect from their executives
740.749	proportional pools of women when they sit down
743.268	once a year for their succession discussions.
745.856	Why? Because if they aren't seeing that,
748.961	it could be a red flag
750.749	that their organization isn't as aligned
753.641	as it could potentially be.
756.149	It's important for CEOs
757.645	to also expect these proportional pools,
760.469	and if they hear comments like,
761.976	"""Well, she doesn't have"
761.976	"enough business experience,"""
764.519	ask the question,
766.05	"""What are we going to do about that?"""
768.174	It's important for H.R. executives
770.323	to make sure that the missing 33 percent
772.955	is appropriately emphasized,
775.116	and it's important for women and men
777.219	who are in management positions
779.277	to examine the mindsets we hold
781.42	about women and men, about careers and success,
783.687	to make sure we are creating a level playing field
786.398	for everybody.
788.322	So let me close with the latest chapter
790.245	in Tonya's story.
792.08	Tonya emailed me two months ago,
793.924	and she said that she had been
793.924	interviewed for a new position,
796.838	and during the interview, they probed
798.649	about her business acumen
800.178	and her strategic insights into the industry,
803.407	and she said that she was so happy to report
805.871	that now she has a new position
807.829	reporting directly to the 
807.829	chief information officer
810.922	at her company.
813.138	So for some of you, the missing 33 percent
815.714	is an idea for you to put into action,
818.695	and I hope that for all of you,
820.956	you will see it as an idea worth spreading
824.108	in order to help organizations be more effective,
826.581	to help women create careers that soar,
829.157	and to help close the gender gap at the top.
832.761	Thank you.
834.584	(Applause)
