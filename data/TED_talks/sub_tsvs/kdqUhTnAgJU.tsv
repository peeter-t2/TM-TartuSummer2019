12.653	We are all activists now.
15.42	(Applause)
16.74	Thank you.
18.5	I'll just stop here.
19.859	(Laughter)
21.06	From the families who are fighting
21.06	to maintain funding for public schools,
26.46	the tens of thousands of people
26.46	who joined Occupy Wall Street
30.86	or marched with Black Lives Matter
33.06	to protest police brutality
33.06	against African Americans,
37.58	families that join rallies,
40.1	pro-life and pro-choice,
43.42	those of us who are afraid
45.18	that our friends and neighbors
45.18	are going to be deported
48.58	or that they'll be added to lists
50.58	because they are Muslim,
53.3	people who advocate for gun rights
53.3	and for gun control
58.46	and the millions of people
58.46	who joined the women's marches
61.98	all across the country this last January.
64.78	(Applause)
67.46	We are all activists now,
69.58	and that means that we all have something
69.58	to worry about from surveillance.
75.14	Surveillance means
75.14	government collection and use
77.86	of private and sensitive data about us.
81.1	And surveillance is essential
83.06	to law enforcement
83.06	and to national security.
86.18	But the history of surveillance
88.18	is one that includes surveillance abuses
91.7	where this sensitive information
91.7	has been used against people
95.18	because of their race,
96.74	their national origin,
98.54	their sexual orientation,
100.62	and in particular,
100.62	because of their activism,
103.82	their political beliefs.
106.58	About 53 years ago,
109.22	Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
109.22	"gave his ""I have a dream"" speech"
112.78	on the Mall in Washington.
114.86	And today the ideas behind this speech
114.86	of racial equality and tolerance
119.58	are so noncontroversial
121.54	that my daughters
121.54	study the speech in third grade.
124.98	But at the time,
126.34	Dr. King was extremely controversial.
129.34	The legendary and notorious
129.34	FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover believed,
134.86	or wanted to believe,
136.7	that the Civil Rights Movement
136.7	was a Soviet communist plot
140.299	intended to destabilize
140.299	the American government.
143.9	And so Hoover had his agents
143.9	put bugs in Dr. King's hotel rooms,
150.18	and those bugs picked up conversations
150.18	between civil rights leaders
155.74	talking about the strategies and tactics
155.74	of the Civil Rights Movement.
160.9	They also picked up sounds of Dr. King
163.14	having sex with women
163.14	who were not his wife,
166.02	and J. Edgar Hoover
166.02	saw the opportunity here
168.78	to discredit and undermine
168.78	the Civil Rights Movement.
173.22	The FBI sent a package of these recordings
176.86	along with a handwritten note to Dr. King,
180.7	and a draft of this note
180.7	was found in FBI archives years later,
187.1	and the letter said,
188.86	"""You are no clergyman and you know it."
191.66	King, like all frauds,
191.66	"your end is approaching."""
195.86	The letter even seemed
195.86	to encourage Dr. King to commit suicide,
201.38	"saying, ""King, there is"
201.38	only one thing left for you to do.
205.18	You know what it is.
206.78	You better take it before
206.78	your filthy, abnormal, fraudulent self
211.14	"is bared to the nation."""
213.02	But the important thing is,
214.46	Dr. King was not abnormal.
216.7	Every one of us has something
216.7	that we want to hide from somebody.
221.82	And even more important,
223.66	J. Edgar Hoover wasn't abnormal either.
226.9	The history of surveillance abuses
228.86	is not the history
228.86	of one bad, megalomaniacal man.
232.9	Throughout his decades at the FBI,
235.94	J. Edgar Hoover enjoyed the support
235.94	of the presidents that he served,
239.7	Democratic and Republican alike.
242.5	After all, it was John F. Kennedy
242.5	and his brother Robert Kennedy
245.86	who knew about and approved
245.86	the surveillance of Dr. King.
250.46	Hoover ran a program
250.46	called COINTELPRO for 15 years
254.9	which was designed
254.9	to spy on and undermine civic groups
259.7	that were devoted
259.7	to things like civil rights,
262.46	the Women's Rights Movement,
264.22	and peace groups and anti-war movements.
266.98	And the surveillance didn't stop there.
269.779	Lyndon Baines Johnson,
271.5	during the election campaign,
273.54	had the campaign airplane
273.54	of his rival Barry Goldwater bugged
279.54	as part of his effort
279.54	to win that election.
283.02	And then, of course, there was Watergate.
287.34	Burglars were caught
288.82	breaking into the Democratic
288.82	National Committee headquarters
291.7	at the Watergate Hotel,
293.26	the Nixon administration was involved
293.26	in covering up the burglary,
297.46	and eventually Nixon
297.46	had to step down as president.
301.86	COINTELPRO and Watergate
301.86	were a wake-up call for Americans.
306.62	Surveillance was out of control
308.5	and it was being used
308.5	to squelch political challengers.
313.06	And so Americans rose to the occasion
315.62	and what we did was
315.62	we reformed surveillance law.
319.98	And the primary tool we used
319.98	to reform surveillance law
324.38	was to require a search warrant
327.1	for the government to be able to get
327.1	access to our phone calls and our letters.
333.54	Now, the reason why
333.54	a search warrant is important
336.42	is because it interposes a judge
338.78	in the relationship
338.78	between investigators and the citizens,
342.42	and that judge's job is to make sure
345.42	that there's good cause
345.42	for the surveillance,
348.06	that the surveillance
348.06	is targeted at the right people,
351.5	and that the information that's collected
354.02	is going to be used
354.02	for legitimate government purposes
357.66	and not for discriminatory ones.
360.62	This was our system,
361.86	and what this means is
363.14	that President Obama
363.14	did not wiretap Trump Tower.
366.98	The system is set up to prevent
366.98	something like that from happening
371.82	without a judge being involved.
374.3	But what happens when we're not talking
374.3	about phone calls or letters anymore?
380.34	Today, we have technology
383.06	that makes it cheap and easy
383.06	for the government to collect information
387.26	on ordinary everyday people.
390.38	Your phone call records
393.1	can reveal whether you have an addiction,
396.74	what your religion is,
398.22	what charities you donate to,
400.9	what political candidate you support.
403.86	And yet, our government
403.86	collected, dragnet-style,
407.98	Americans' calling records for years.
412.14	In 2012, the Republican
412.14	National Convention
416.3	highlighted a new technology
416.3	it was planning to use,
419.7	facial recognition,
421.22	to identify people
421.22	who were going to be in the crowd
424.22	who might be activists or troublemakers
426.7	and to stop them ahead of time.
429.02	Today, over 50 percent of American adults
432.74	have their faceprint
432.74	in a government database.
435.74	The Bureau of Alcohol,
435.74	Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
439.06	concocted a plan
440.62	to find out what Americans
440.62	were going to gun shows
444.18	by using license plate detectors
446.7	to scan the license plates of cars
448.82	that were in the parking lots
448.82	of these events.
451.7	Today, we believe that over 70 percent
451.7	of police departments
456.14	have automatic license plate
456.14	detection technology
459.26	that they're using to track people's cars
459.26	as they drive through town.
463.78	And all of this information,
466.42	the license plates, the faceprints,
469.38	the phone records,
470.98	your address books, your buddy lists,
473.82	the photos that you upload
473.82	to Dropbox or Google Photos,
478.26	and sometimes even
478.26	your chats and your emails
482.26	are not protected
482.26	by a warrant requirement.
485.58	So what that means is we have
485.58	all of this information on regular people
491.18	that's newly available
491.18	at very low expense.
494.86	It is the golden age for surveillance.
498.3	Now, every parent is going
498.3	to understand what this means.
503.62	When you have a little baby
505.78	and the baby's young,
507.74	that child is not able
507.74	to climb out of its crib.
511.02	But eventually your little girl gets older
513.94	and she's able to climb out of the crib,
516.9	but you tell her,
516.9	"""Don't climb out of the crib. OK?"""
520.7	And every parent knows
520.7	what's going to happen.
522.9	Some of those babies
522.9	are going to climb out of the crib.
526.379	Right? That's the difference
526.379	between ability and permission.
530.06	Well, the same thing is true
530.06	with the government today.
532.7	It used to be that our government
532.7	didn't have the ability
535.499	to do widespread, massive surveillance
535.499	on hundreds of millions of Americans
539.1	and then abuse that information.
541.34	But now our government has grown up,
543.22	and we have that technology today.
546.02	The government has the ability,
548.62	and that means the law
548.62	is more important than ever before.
552.22	The law is supposed to say
553.98	when the government
553.98	has permission to do it,
558.02	and it's supposed to ensure
558.02	that there's some kind of ramification.
562.18	We notice when those laws are broken
564.7	and there's some of kind of
564.7	ramification or punishment.
567.42	The law is more important than ever
567.42	because we are now living in a world
570.86	where only rules
570.86	are stopping the government
572.98	from abusing this information.
574.94	But the law has fallen down on the job.
577.66	Particularly since September 11
577.66	the law has fallen down on the job,
581.62	and we do not have
581.62	the rules in place that we need.
585.22	And we are seeing
585.22	the ramifications of that.
588.02	So fusion centers
588.02	are these joint task forces
591.3	between local, state
591.3	and federal government
593.62	that are meant to ferret out
593.62	domestic terrorism.
596.86	And what we've seen
596.86	is fusion center reports
599.38	that say that you might be dangerous
603.18	if you voted for a third-party candidate,
606.14	"or you own a ""Don't Tread On Me"" flag,"
609.34	or you watched movies that are anti-tax.
613.7	These same fusion centers have spied
613.7	on Muslim community groups' reading lists
618.5	and on Quakers who are resisting
618.5	military recruiting in high schools.
624.5	The Internal Revenue Service
624.5	has disproportionately audited
628.7	"groups that have ""Tea Party"""
628.7	"or ""Patriot"" in their name."
632.38	And now customs and border patrol
634.98	is stopping people
634.98	as they come into the country
637.78	and demanding our social
637.78	networking passwords
640.98	which will allow them
640.98	to see who our friends are,
643.58	what we say
644.82	and even to impersonate us online.
648.34	Now, civil libertarians like myself
651.02	have been trying to draw
651.02	people's attention to these things
655.18	and fighting against them for years.
657.78	This was a huge problem
657.78	during the Obama administration,
662.78	but now the problem is worse.
666.34	When the New York Police Department
668.82	spies on Muslims
670.54	or a police department
670.54	uses license plate detectors
674.42	to find out where
674.42	the officers' spouses are
678.34	or those sorts of things,
679.62	that is extremely dangerous.
681.74	But when a president repurposes the power
684.82	of federal surveillance
684.82	and the federal government
687.34	to retaliate against political opposition,
690.42	that is a tyranny.
692.3	And so we are all activists now,
696.46	and we all have something
696.46	to fear from surveillance.
700.58	But just like in the time
700.58	of Dr. Martin Luther King,
704.38	we can reform the way things are.
707.74	First of all, use encryption.
710.94	Encryption protects your information
713.86	from being inexpensively
713.86	and opportunistically collected.
718.7	It rolls back the golden age
718.7	for surveillance.
723.9	Second, support surveillance reform.
727.54	Did you know that if you have a friend
729.74	who works for the French
729.74	or German governments
732.86	or for an international human rights group
736.02	or for a global oil company
739.42	that your friend is a valid
739.42	foreign intelligence target?
743.74	And what that means is that when
743.74	you have conversations with that friend,
747.9	the US government
747.9	may be collecting that information.
752.14	And when that information is collected,
755.42	even though it's
755.42	conversations with Americans,
757.62	it can then be funneled to the FBI
760.74	where the FBI is allowed
760.74	to search through it
763.22	without getting a warrant,
764.62	without probable cause,
766.3	looking for information about Americans
768.54	and whatever crimes we may have committed
771.98	with no need to document
771.98	any kind of suspicion.
775.74	The law that allows some of this to happen
778.74	is called Section 702
778.74	of the FISA Amendments Act,
782.86	and we have a great opportunity this year,
785.42	because Section 702
785.42	is going to expire at the end of 2017,
790.18	which means that
790.18	Congress's inertia is on our side
794.82	if we want reform.
796.42	And we can pressure our representatives
800.14	to actually implement
800.14	important reforms to this law
803.66	and protect our data
803.66	from this redirection and misuse.
808.38	And finally, one of the reasons
808.38	why things have gotten so out of control
813.42	is because so much
813.42	of what happens with surveillance --
816.34	the technology, the enabling rules
816.34	and the policies
820.9	that are either there
820.9	or not there to protect us --
824.5	are secret or classified.
826.94	We need transparency,
826.94	and we need to know as Americans
831.18	what the government is doing in our name
833.74	so that the surveillance that takes place
833.74	and the use of that information
838.34	is democratically accounted for.
842.22	We are all activists now,
844.34	which means that we all have something
844.34	to worry about from surveillance.
848.54	But like in the time
848.54	of Dr. Martin Luther King,
851.98	there is stuff that we can do about it.
854.3	So please join me, and let's get to work.
858.82	Thank you.
860.06	(Applause)
