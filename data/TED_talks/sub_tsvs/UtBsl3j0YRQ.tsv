12.496	There is something you know about me,
16.255	something very personal,
20.095	and there is something
20.095	I know about every one of you
24.55	and that's very central to your concerns.
28.663	There is something that we know
31.268	about everyone we meet
31.268	anywhere in the world, on the street,
37.326	that is the very mainspring
37.326	of whatever they do
42.304	and whatever they put up with.
46.047	And that is that all of us
46.047	want to be happy.
52.341	In this, we are all together.
55.203	How we imagine our happiness,
55.203	that differs from one another,
60.701	but it's already a lot
60.701	that we have all in common,
65.529	that we want to be happy.
69.164	Now my topic is gratefulness.
72.612	What is the connection
72.612	between happiness and gratefulness?
79.31	Many people would say,
79.31	well, that's very easy.
82.328	When you are happy, you are grateful.
86.331	But think again.
89.688	Is it really the happy people
89.688	that are grateful?
95.077	We all know quite a number of people
98.642	who have everything
98.642	that it would take to be happy,
102.843	and they are not happy,
104.624	because they want something else
104.624	or they want more of the same.
110.173	And we all know people
110.173	who have lots of misfortune,
117.021	misfortune that we ourselves
117.021	would not want to have,
120.822	and they are deeply happy.
123.574	They radiate happiness. You are surprised.
127.017	Why? Because they are grateful.
130.348	So it is not happiness
130.348	that makes us grateful.
134.407	It's gratefulness that makes us happy.
137.835	If you think it's happiness
137.835	that makes you grateful,
140.776	think again.
142.285	It's gratefulness that makes you happy.
146.293	Now, we can ask,
148.805	what do we really mean by gratefulness?
152.897	And how does it work?
157.985	I appeal to your own experience.
159.975	We all know from experience how it goes.
163.055	We experience something
163.055	that's valuable to us.
168.734	Something is given to us
168.734	that's valuable to us.
173.925	And it's really given.
175.871	These two things have to come together.
178.114	It has to be something valuable,
178.114	and it's a real gift.
183.727	You haven't bought it.
183.727	You haven't earned it.
186.894	You haven't traded it in.
186.894	You haven't worked for it.
189.369	It's just given to you.
190.821	And when these two things come together,
193.088	something that's really valuable to me
193.088	and I realize it's freely given,
198.737	then gratefulness spontaneously
198.737	rises in my heart,
203.674	happiness spontaneously rises in my heart.
208.037	That's how gratefulness happens.
211.546	Now the key to all this
216.965	is that we cannot only
216.965	experience this once in a while.
224.997	We cannot only have grateful experiences.
228.755	We can be people who live gratefully.
232.649	Grateful living, that is the thing.
236.216	And how can we live gratefully?
240.136	By experiencing, by becoming aware
244.52	that every moment
244.52	is a given moment, as we say.
249.293	It's a gift. You haven't earned it.
251.898	You haven't brought it about in any way.
254.805	You have no way of assuring
257.917	that there will be
257.917	another moment given to you,
260.917	and yet, that's the most valuable thing
260.917	that can ever be given to us,
266.006	this moment, with all the opportunity
266.006	that it contains.
271.518	If we didn't have this present moment,
274.182	we wouldn't have
274.182	any opportunity to do anything
277.382	or experience anything,
279.23	and this moment is a gift.
281.242	It's a given moment, as we say.
283.712	Now, we say the gift within this gift
283.712	is really the opportunity.
290.352	What you are really grateful for
290.352	is the opportunity,
294.918	not the thing that is given to you,
296.876	because if that thing were somewhere else
298.855	and you didn't have
298.855	the opportunity to enjoy it,
302.385	to do something with it,
304.22	you wouldn't be grateful for it.
307.149	Opportunity is the gift within every gift,
311.169	and we have this saying,
311.169	opportunity knocks only once.
317.943	Well, think again.
320.679	Every moment is a new gift,
320.679	over and over again,
324.89	and if you miss the opportunity
324.89	of this moment,
328.158	another moment is given to us,
328.158	and another moment.
332.175	We can avail ourselves
332.175	of this opportunity,
334.889	or we can miss it,
336.76	and if we avail ourselves
336.76	of the opportunity,
340.694	it is the key to happiness.
343.511	Behold the master key to our happiness
346.776	in our own hands.
348.579	Moment by moment,
348.579	we can be grateful for this gift.
353.593	Does that mean
356.116	that we can be grateful for everything?
359.629	Certainly not.
361.597	We cannot be grateful
361.597	for violence, for war,
366.537	for oppression, for exploitation.
369.36	On the personal level,
369.36	we cannot be grateful
372.123	for the loss of a friend,
372.123	for unfaithfulness,
375.424	for bereavement.
378.733	But I didn't say
378.733	we can be grateful for everything.
382.527	I said we can be grateful
382.527	in every given moment
387.033	for the opportunity,
388.887	and even when we are confronted
388.887	with something that is terribly difficult,
395.306	we can rise to this occasion
397.846	and respond to the opportunity
397.846	that is given to us.
402.101	It isn't as bad as it might seem.
404.476	Actually, when you look at it
404.476	and experience it,
408.369	you find that most of the time,
411.325	what is given to us
411.325	is the opportunity to enjoy,
415.058	and we only miss it
415.058	because we are rushing through life
418.099	and we are not stopping
418.099	to see the opportunity.
421.919	But once in a while,
423.35	something very difficult is given to us,
426.296	and when this difficult thing
426.296	occurs to us,
430.387	it's a challenge to rise
430.387	to that opportunity,
434.715	and we can rise to it
434.715	by learning something
438.135	which is sometimes painful.
439.876	Learning patience, for instance.
441.963	We have been told that the road to peace
444.96	is not a sprint,
444.96	but is more like a marathon.
448.728	That takes patience. That's difficult.
452.439	It may be to stand up for your opinion,
452.439	to stand up for your conviction.
459.126	That's an opportunity that is given to us.
462.314	To learn, to suffer, to stand up,
465.763	all these opportunities are given to us,
468.133	but they are opportunities,
469.639	and those who avail themselves
469.639	of those opportunities
473.515	are the ones that we admire.
475.642	They make something out of life.
477.914	And those who fail
477.914	get another opportunity.
483.023	We always get another opportunity.
485.24	That's the wonderful richness of life.
490.272	So how can we find a method
490.272	that will harness this?
496.821	How can each one of us find a method
496.821	for living gratefully,
501.851	not just once in a while being grateful,
503.78	but moment by moment to be grateful.
506.591	How can we do it?
506.591	It's a very simple method.
509.967	It's so simple that it's actually
509.967	what we were told as children
515.054	when we learned to cross the street.
517.882	Stop.
519.421	Look.
520.646	Go.
521.871	That's all.
523.27	But how often do we stop?
525.982	We rush through life. We don't stop.
528.751	We miss the opportunity
528.751	because we don't stop.
533.012	We have to stop.
535.883	We have to get quiet.
538.128	And we have to build
538.128	stop signs into our lives.
543.628	When I was in Africa
543.628	some years ago and then came back,
548.62	I noticed water.
551.114	In Africa where I was,
551.114	I didn't have drinkable water.
555.293	Every time I turned on the faucet,
555.293	I was overwhelmed.
560.067	Every time I clicked on the light,
560.067	I was so grateful.
563.676	It made me so happy.
565.241	But after a while, this wears off.
567.248	So I put little stickers
567.248	on the light switch
571.034	and on the water faucet,
572.735	and every time I turned it on, water.
575.817	So leave it up to your own imagination.
578.697	You can find whatever works best for you,
580.674	but you need stop signs in your life.
584.278	And when you stop,
586.229	then the next thing is to look.
588.73	You look. You open your eyes.
590.985	You open your ears. You open your nose.
593.271	You open all your senses
595.691	for this wonderful richness
595.691	that is given to us.
599.326	There is no end to it,
599.326	and that is what life is all about,
603.302	to enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us.
606.932	And then we can also open our hearts,
609.775	our hearts for the opportunities,
612.621	for the opportunities also to help others,
615.863	to make others happy,
617.158	because nothing makes us more happy
617.158	than when all of us are happy.
622.743	And when we open
622.743	our hearts to the opportunities,
626.901	the opportunities invite us
626.901	to do something,
630.541	and that is the third.
631.888	Stop, look, and then go,
631.888	and really do something.
636.351	And what we can do
637.955	is whatever life offers to you
637.955	in that present moment.
642.641	Mostly it's the opportunity to enjoy,
647.708	but sometimes
647.708	it's something more difficult.
651.108	But whatever it is,
651.108	if we take this opportunity,
655.4	we go with it, we are creative,
655.4	those are the creative people.
660.871	And that little stop, look, go,
664.744	is such a potent seed
666.998	that it can revolutionize our world.
670.5	Because we are at the present moment
675.82	in the middle of a change
675.82	of consciousness,
679.156	and you will be surprised if you --
682.002	I am always surprised
682.002	when I hear how many times
684.688	"this word ""gratefulness"""
684.688	"and ""gratitude"" comes up."
687.952	Everywhere you find it,
689.29	a grateful airline,
689.29	a restaurant gratefulness,
692.569	a caf√© gratefulness,
692.569	a wine that is gratefulness.
695.778	Yes, I have even come across
695.778	a toilet paper
699.053	"whose brand is called ""Thank You."""
701.42	(Laughter)
703.04	There is a wave of gratefulness
705.006	because people are becoming aware
705.006	how important this is
708.812	and how this can change our world.
711.884	It can change our world
711.884	in immensely important ways,
718.524	because if you're grateful,
718.524	you're not fearful,
722.135	and if you're not fearful,
722.135	you're not violent.
725.521	If you're grateful,
725.521	you act out of a sense of enough
729.707	and not of a sense of scarcity,
731.801	and you are willing to share.
733.85	If you are grateful,
735.142	you are enjoying
735.142	the differences between people,
738.017	and you are respectful to everybody,
740.396	and that changes this power pyramid
740.396	under which we live.
744.129	And it doesn't make for equality,
744.129	but it makes for equal respect,
749.157	and that is the important thing.
751.161	The future of the world will be a network,
754.861	not a pyramid turned upside down.
758.511	The revolution of which I am speaking
758.511	is a nonviolent revolution,
763.023	and it's so revolutionary
763.023	that it even revolutionizes
766.912	the very concept of a revolution,
769.093	because the normal revolution
771.354	is one where the power pyramid
771.354	is turned upside down
774.362	and those who were on the bottom
774.362	are now on the top
777.531	and are doing exactly the same thing
777.531	that the ones before.
782.246	What we need is a networking
782.246	of smaller groups,
786.582	smaller and smaller groups
786.582	who know one another,
790.252	who interact with one another,
790.252	and that is a grateful world.
794.823	A grateful world
794.823	is a world of joyful people.
798.971	Grateful people are joyful people,
801.642	and joyful people --
803.683	the more and more joyful people there are,
806.446	the more and more
806.446	we'll have a joyful world.
810.758	We have a network for grateful living,
810.758	and it has mushroomed.
816.829	We couldn't understand why it mushroomed.
819.276	We have an opportunity
819.276	for people to light a candle
822.612	when they are grateful for something.
825.217	And there have been
832.072	People are becoming aware
832.072	that a grateful world is a happy world,
838.297	and we all have the opportunity
838.297	by the simple stop, look, go,
844.323	to transform the world,
844.323	to make it a happy place.
848.059	And that is what I hope for us,
849.561	and if this has contributed a little
849.561	to making you want to do the same,
854.459	stop, look, go.
856.121	Thank you.
857.314	(Applause)
