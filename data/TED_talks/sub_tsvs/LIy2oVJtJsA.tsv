12.982	Nine years ago, I worked
14.602	for the U.S. government in Iraq,
16.799	helping rebuild the electricity infrastructure.
19.928	And I was there, and I worked in that job
22.565	because I believe that technology
24.415	can improve people's lives.
27.064	One afternoon, I had tea with a storekeeper
29.999	at the Al Rasheed Hotel in Baghdad,
32.819	"and he said to me, ""You Americans,"
35.558	you can put a man on the moon,
36.909	but when I get home tonight,
38.454	"I won't be able to turn on my lights."""
41.31	At the time, the U.S. government had spent
42.967	more than two billion dollars
45.327	on electricity reconstruction.
47.684	How do you ensure technology reaches users?
50.856	How do you put it in their hands
52.836	so that it is useful?
55.072	So those are the questions that my colleagues and I
58.116	at D-Rev ask ourselves.
60.229	And D-Rev is short for Design Revolution.
63.377	And I took over the organization four years ago
65.971	and really focused it on developing products
68.272	that actually reach users,
70.46	and not just any users,
71.946	but customers who live on
71.946	less than four dollars a day.
76.001	One of the key areas we've been working on recently
77.909	is medical devices, and while it may not be obvious
80.422	that medical devices have something in common
82.554	with Iraq's electricity grid then,
85.12	there are some commonalities.
87.249	Despite the advanced technology,
89.958	it's not reaching the people who need it most.
92.726	So I'm going to tell you about one of
92.726	the projects we've been working on,
95.134	the ReMotion Knee, and it's a prosthetic knee
98.041	for above-knee amputees.
100.197	And this project started when
100.197	the Jaipur Foot Organization,
103.497	the largest fitter of prosthetic limbs in the world,
106.091	came to the Bay Area and they said,
107.56	"""We need a better knee."""
110.53	Chances are, if you're living on
110.53	less than four dollars a day,
113.678	and you're an amputee,
115.555	you've lost your limb in a vehicle accident.
117.729	Most people think it's land mines,
119.142	but it's a vehicle accident.
120.748	You're walking by the side of the road
122.604	and you're hit by a truck,
124.028	or you're trying to to jump on a moving train,
125.889	you're late for work, and your pant leg gets caught.
129.873	And the reality is that if
129.873	you don't have much money,
133.038	like this young named Kamal right here,
135.038	the option you really have
137.242	is a bamboo staff to get around.
139.806	And how big a problem is this?
142.289	There's over three million amputees every year
145.215	who need a new or replacement knee.
148.504	And what are their options?
150.373	This is a high-end. This is
150.373	"what we'd call a ""smart knee."""
152.972	It's got a microprocessor inside.
154.99	It can pretty much do anything,
157.075	but it's 20,000 dollars,
158.772	and to give you a sense of who wears this,
160.978	veterans, American veterans coming
160.978	back from Afghanistan or Iraq
164.221	would be fit with something like this.
166.547	This is a low-end titanium knee.
169.064	It's a polycentric knee, and all that that means
171.541	is the mechanism, is a four-bar mechanism,
173.75	that mimics a natural human knee.
176.3	But at 1,400 dollars, it's still too expensive
178.703	for people like Kamal.
181.087	And lastly, here you see a low-end knee.
183.68	This is a knee that's been designed specifically
185.511	for poor people.
187.187	And while you have affordability,
189.02	you've lost on functionality.
190.915	The mechanism here is a single axis,
193.566	and a single axis is like a door hinge.
195.815	So you can think about how unstable that would be.
198.01	And this is the type of mechanism
200.005	that the Jaipur Foot Organization was using
200.005	when they were looking for a better knee,
203.894	and I just wanted to give you a sense
203.894	of what a leg system looks like,
206.251	because I'm showing you all these knees
207.59	and I imagine it's hard to think 
207.59	how it all fits together.
209.966	So at the top you have a socket,
212.008	and this fits over someone's residual limb,
213.954	and everyone's residual limb is a little bit different.
216.514	And then you have the knee,
217.698	and here I've got a single axis on the knee
219.416	so you can see how it rotates,
221.128	and then a pylon, and then a foot.
225.091	And we've been able to develop a knee,
227.634	a polycentric knee, so that type of knee
229.996	that acts like a human knee, mimics human gait,
232.571	for 80 dollars retail.
235.314	(Applause)
238.878	But the key is, you can have this great invention,
241.432	you can have this great design, but how do you get it
243.418	to the people who most need it?
245.19	How do you ensure it gets to them
245.19	and it improves their lives?
248.496	So at D-Rev, we've done some other projects,
251.432	and we looked at three things that we really believe
253.816	gets technologies to customers, to users,
257.788	to people who need it.
259.164	And the first thing is that the product 
259.164	needs to be world class.
261.885	It needs to perform on par
263.536	or better than the best products on the market.
266.381	Regardless of your income level,
268.527	you want the most beautiful,
270.065	the best product that there is.
272.753	I'm going to show you a video now
276.242	of a man named Ash. You can see him walking.
277.888	He's wearing the same knee system here
279.8	with a single axis knee.
281.406	And he's doing a 10-meter walk test.
283.498	And you'll notice that he's struggling 
283.498	with stability as he's walking.
287.313	And something that's not obvious, that you can't see,
289.968	is that it's psychologically draining
292.555	to walk and to be preventing yourself from falling.
296.337	Now this is a video of Kamal.
298.041	You remember Kamal earlier,
298.041	holding the bamboo staff.
300.774	He's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee,
303.482	and he's doing that same 10-meter walk test.
306.582	And you can see his stability is much better.
311.849	So world class isn't just about
311.849	technical performance.
314.968	It's also about human performance.
318.308	And most medical devices, we've learned,
320.166	as we've dug in, are really designed for Westerners,
322.694	for wealthier economies.
324.357	But the reality is our users, our customers,
327.619	they do different things. They sit cross-legged more.
330.172	We see that they squat. They kneel in prayer.
333.014	And we designed our knee to have
333.014	the greatest range of motion
335.762	of almost any other knee on the market.
339.846	So the second thing we learned, and this leads
341.576	into my second point, which is that we believe
343.836	that products need to be
343.836	designed to be user-centric.
346.553	And at D-Rev, we go one step further and we say
349.153	you need to be user-obsessed.
351.053	So it's not just the end user
351.053	that you're thinking about,
353.773	but everyone who interacts with the product,
355.749	so, for example, the prosthetist who fits the knee,
358.463	but also the context in which the knee is being fit.
361.631	What is the local market like?
363.215	How do all these components get to the clinic?
365.133	Do they all get there on time? The supply chain.
367.455	Everything that goes into ensuring
369.558	that this product gets to the end user,
371.541	and it goes in as part of the system, and it's used.
375.962	So I wanted to show you some of the iterations
377.828	we did between the first version, the Jaipur Knee,
382.421	so this is it right here.
384.242	(Clicking)
385.968	Notice anything about it?
388.186	It clicks.
390.747	We'd seen that users had actually modified it.
393.613	So do you see that black strip right there?
397.125	That's a homemade noise dampener.
400.117	We also saw that our users had modified it
402.335	in other ways.
403.769	You can see there that that particular amputee,
405.559	he had wrapped bandages around the knee.
407.788	He'd made a cosmesis.
409.512	And if you look at the knee,
411.708	it's got those pointy edges, right?
415.162	So if you're wearing it under pants or a skirt
417.365	or a sari, it's really obvious
419.625	that you're wearing a prosthetic limb,
421.221	and in societies where there's social
421.221	stigma around being disabled,
425.413	people are particularly acute about this.
428.37	So I'm going to show you some
428.37	of the modifications we did.
430.686	We did a lot of iterations, not just 
430.686	around this, but some other things.
433.601	But here we have the version three, 
433.601	the ReMotion Knee,
436.029	but if you look in here, you can see
437.848	the noise dampener. It's quieter.
442.566	The other thing we did is that
442.566	we smoothed the profile.
446.219	We made it thinner.
447.651	And something that's not obvious is that we
449.359	designed it for mass production.
452.56	And this goes into my last point.
454.256	We really, truly believe that if a product
456.227	is going to reach users at the scale that it's needed,
458.564	it needs to be market-driven,
460.399	and market-driven means that products are sold.
463.644	They're not donated. They're not heavily subsidized.
466.767	Our product needs to be designed to offer value
468.98	to the end user.
470.281	It also has to be designed to be very affordable.
472.46	But a product that is valued by a customer
474.634	is used by a customer,
476.345	and use is what creates impact.
478.518	And we believe that as designers,
480.277	it holds us accountable to our customers.
483.507	And with centralized manufacturing,
486.123	you can control the quality control,
488.15	and you can hit that $80 price point
489.878	with profit margins built in.
492.368	And now, those profit margins are critical,
494.524	because if you want to scale, if you want to reach
496.193	all the people in the world who possibly need a knee,
498.452	it needs to be economically sustainable.
501.609	So I want to give you a sense of where we are at.
504.205	We have fit over 5,000 amputees,
507.781	and one of the big indicators
507.781	we're looking at, of course,
510	is, does it improve lives?
511.913	Well, the standard is, is someone
513.649	still wearing their knee six months later?
516.174	The industry average is about 65 percent.
518.877	Ours is 79 percent,
521.169	and we're hoping to get that higher.
524.113	Right now, our knees are worn in 12 countries.
527.126	This is where we want to get, though,
528.736	in the next three years.
530.254	We'll double the impact in 2015,
532.754	and we'll double it each of
532.754	the following years after that.
535.872	But then we hit a new challenge,
537.705	and that's the number of skilled prosthetists
539.724	who are able to fit knees.
542.832	So I want to end with a story of Pournima.
545.513	Pournima was 18 years old
547.16	when she was in a car accident
547.16	where she lost her leg,
550.028	and she traveled 12 hours by train
553.469	to come to the clinic to be fit with a knee,
555.896	and while all of the amputees who wear our knees
558.489	affect us as the designers,
560.665	she's particularly meaningful to me 
560.665	as an engineer and as a woman,
564.932	because she was in school,
566.496	she had just started school to study engineering.
569.22	"And she said, ""Well, now that I can walk again,"
571.375	"I can go back and complete my studies."""
573.783	And to me she represents the next generation
576.953	of engineers solving problems
579.985	and ensuring meaningful technologies
582.43	reach their users.
584.214	So thank you.
586.252	(Applause)
