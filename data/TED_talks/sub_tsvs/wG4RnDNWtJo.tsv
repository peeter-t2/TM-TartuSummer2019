12.999	Over a million people are killed
12.999	each year in disasters.
17.999	Two and a half million people
17.999	will be permanently disabled or displaced,
23.257	and the communities will take
27.205	and billions of economic losses.
31.054	If you can reduce
31.054	the initial response by one day,
35.449	you can reduce the overall recovery
39	by a thousand days, or three years.
41.832	See how that works?
43.609	If the initial responders
43.609	can get in, save lives,
46.483	mitigate whatever flooding
46.483	danger there is,
49.023	that means the other groups can get in
51.331	to restore the water,
51.331	the roads, the electricity,
54.34	which means then the construction people,
54.34	the insurance agents,
57.48	all of them can get in
57.48	to rebuild the houses,
60.118	which then means
60.118	you can restore the economy,
63.13	and maybe even make it better
63.13	and more resilient to the next disaster.
69.899	A major insurance company told me
71.719	that if they can get a homeowner's claim
71.719	processed one day earlier,
76.855	it'll make a difference of six months
78.999	in that person getting
78.999	their home repaired.
82.118	And that's why I do disaster robotics --
84.471	because robots can
84.471	make a disaster go away faster.
90.305	Now, you've already seen
90.305	a couple of these.
92.346	These are the UAVs.
94.09	These are two types of UAVs:
95.975	a rotorcraft, or hummingbird;
97.864	a fixed-wing, a hawk.
99.958	And they're used extensively since 2005 --
103.372	Hurricane Katrina.
104.571	Let me show you how this hummingbird,
104.571	this rotorcraft, works.
107.919	Fantastic for structural engineers.
110.999	Being able to see damage from angles you
110.999	can't get from binoculars on the ground
115.443	or from a satellite image,
116.777	or anything flying at a higher angle.
120.53	But it's not just structural engineers
120.53	and insurance people who need this.
124.926	You've got things
124.926	like this fixed-wing, this hawk.
127.417	Now, this hawk can be used
127.417	for geospatial surveys.
130.712	That's where you're
130.712	pulling imagery together
133.585	and getting 3D reconstruction.
135.434	We used both of these at the Oso mudslides
135.434	up in Washington State,
139.532	because the big problem
141.755	was geospatial and hydrological
141.755	understanding of the disaster --
144.937	not the search and rescue.
146.207	The search and rescue teams
146.207	had it under control
148.55	and knew what they were doing.
150.052	The bigger problem was that river
150.052	and mudslide might wipe them out
153.946	and flood the responders.
155.464	And not only was it challenging
155.464	to the responders and property damage,
159.23	it's also putting at risk
159.23	the future of salmon fishing
162.533	along that part of Washington State.
164.273	So they needed to understand
164.273	what was going on.
166.773	In seven hours, going from Arlington,
169.406	driving from the Incident Command Post
169.406	to the site, flying the UAVs,
174.244	processing the data, driving back
174.244	to Arlington command post --
177.999	seven hours.
179.429	We gave them in seven hours
179.429	data that they could take
182.987	only two to three days
182.987	to get any other way --
186.761	and at higher resolution.
189.064	It's a game changer.
191.773	And don't just think about the UAVs.
193.866	I mean, they are sexy -- but remember,
	population lives by water,
199.878	and that means our critical
199.878	infrastructure is underwater --
202.766	the parts that we can't get to,
202.766	like the bridges and things like that.
206.076	And that's why we have
206.076	unmanned marine vehicles,
208.692	one type of which you've already met,
208.692	which is SARbot, a square dolphin.
213.168	It goes underwater and uses sonar.
215.888	Well, why are marine vehicles so important
218.245	and why are they very, very important?
221.393	They get overlooked.
222.933	Think about the Japanese tsunami --
229.349	twice the amount of coastland devastated
229.349	by Hurricane Katrina in the United States.
234.069	You're talking about your bridges,
234.069	your pipelines, your ports -- wiped out.
237.949	And if you don't have a port,
239.585	you don't have a way
239.585	to get in enough relief supplies
242.855	to support a population.
244.1	That was a huge problem
244.1	at the Haiti earthquake.
247.565	So we need marine vehicles.
249.711	Now, let's look at a viewpoint
249.711	from the SARbot
252.166	of what they were seeing.
253.661	We were working on a fishing port.
255.931	We were able to reopen that fishing port,
255.931	using her sonar, in four hours.
261.671	That fishing port was told
261.671	it was going to be six months
264.348	before they could get
264.348	a manual team of divers in,
267.078	and it was going to take
267.078	the divers two weeks.
269.789	They were going to miss
269.789	the fall fishing season,
272.107	which was the major economy for that part,
272.107	which is kind of like their Cape Cod.
276.357	UMVs, very important.
278.649	But you know, all the robots
278.649	I've shown you have been small,
281.921	and that's because robots
281.921	don't do things that people do.
285.722	They go places people can't go.
287.999	And a great example of that is Bujold.
290.999	Unmanned ground vehicles
290.999	are particularly small,
293.999	so Bujold --
295.341	(Laughter)
296.873	Say hello to Bujold.
298.08	(Laughter)
301.606	Bujold was used extensively
301.606	at the World Trade Center
304.999	to go through Towers 1, 2 and 4.
307.403	You're climbing into the rubble,
307.403	rappelling down, going deep in spaces.
312.072	And just to see the World Trade Center
312.072	from Bujold's viewpoint, look at this.
316.655	You're talking about a disaster
316.655	where you can't fit a person or a dog --
321.748	and it's on fire.
323.914	The only hope of getting
323.914	to a survivor way in the basement,
327.672	you have to go through things
327.672	that are on fire.
329.891	It was so hot, on one of the robots,
329.891	the tracks began to melt and come off.
335.161	Robots don't replace people or dogs,
337.973	or hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins.
340.518	They do things new.
342.578	They assist the responders,
342.578	the experts, in new and innovative ways.
348.291	The biggest problem is not
348.291	making the robots smaller, though.
352.744	It's not making them more heat-resistant.
354.999	It's not making more sensors.
356.78	The biggest problem is the data,
356.78	the informatics,
360.414	because these people need to get
360.414	the right data at the right time.
364.474	So wouldn't it be great if we could have
364.474	experts immediately access the robots
369.999	without having to waste any time
369.999	of driving to the site,
372.999	so whoever's there,
372.999	use their robots over the Internet.
375.956	Well, let's think about that.
377.362	Let's think about a chemical
377.362	train derailment in a rural county.
380.758	What are the odds that the experts,
380.758	your chemical engineer,
384.624	your railroad transportation engineers,
386.51	have been trained on whatever UAV
386.51	that particular county happens to have?
391.395	Probably, like, none.
392.952	So we're using these kinds of interfaces
395.366	to allow people to use the robots
395.366	without knowing what robot they're using,
399.73	or even if they're using a robot or not.
404.252	What the robots give you,
404.252	what they give the experts, is data.
410.31	The problem becomes:
410.31	who gets what data when?
413.914	One thing to do is to ship
413.914	all the information to everybody
417.831	and let them sort it out.
419.367	Well, the problem with that
419.367	is it overwhelms the networks,
423.247	and worse yet, it overwhelms
423.247	the cognitive abilities
426.957	of each of the people trying to get
426.957	that one nugget of information
431.49	they need to make the decision
431.49	that's going to make the difference.
435.999	So we need to think
435.999	about those kinds of challenges.
439.117	So it's the data.
440.406	Going back to the World Trade Center,
442.666	we tried to solve that problem
442.666	by just recording the data from Bujold
446.999	only when she was deep in the rubble,
448.999	because that's what the USAR team
448.999	said they wanted.
452.523	What we didn't know at the time
455.135	was that the civil engineers
455.135	would have loved,
457.757	needed the data as we recorded
457.757	the box beams, the serial numbers,
461.999	the locations, as we went into the rubble.
465.343	We lost valuable data.
466.834	So the challenge is getting all the data
469.237	and getting it to the right people.
471.441	Now, here's another reason.
473.542	We've learned that some buildings --
475.877	things like schools,
475.877	hospitals, city halls --
479.173	get inspected four times
479.173	by different agencies
483.216	throughout the response phases.
486.156	Now, we're looking, if we can get
486.156	the data from the robots to share,
489.449	not only can we do things like
489.449	compress that sequence of phases
494.323	to shorten the response time,
496	but now we can begin
496	to do the response in parallel.
500.382	Everybody can see the data.
501.785	We can shorten it that way.
503.999	"So really, ""disaster robotics"""
503.999	is a misnomer.
508.227	It's not about the robots.
510.146	It's about the data.
512.433	(Applause)
515.787	So my challenge to you:
517.768	the next time you hear about a disaster,
520.092	look for the robots.
521.441	They may be underground,
521.441	they may be underwater,
524.59	they may be in the sky,
526.308	but they should be there.
528.297	Look for the robots,
529.488	because robots are coming to the rescue.
532.259	(Applause)
