12.653	So in 2011, I altered my name
16.075	so that I could participate
16.075	in Far Right youth camp in Hungary.
20.614	I was doing a PhD looking at
20.614	youth political socialization --
25.004	why young people were developing
25.004	political ideologies
28.099	in a post-communist setting,
30.133	and I saw that a lot
30.133	of young people I was talking to
33.39	were joining the Far Right,
35.014	and this was astounding to me.
37.194	So I wanted to enroll in this youth camp
39.513	to get a better understanding
39.513	of why people were joining.
42.673	So a colleague enrolled me,
44.254	and my last name sounds
44.254	a little bit too Jewish.
47.5	So Erin got turned into Iréna,
50.269	and Saltman got turned into Sós,
52.493	"which means ""salty"" in Hungarian."
55.438	And in Hungarian,
55.438	your last name goes first,
57.772	so my James Bond name
57.772	"turned into ""Salty Irena,"""
62.21	which is not something
62.21	I would have naturally chosen for myself.
66.1	But going to this camp,
68.031	I was further shocked to realize
68.031	that it was actually really fun.
73	They talked very little about politics.
75.239	It was mostly learning how to ride horses,
78.276	shooting a bow and arrow,
80.168	live music at night,
81.879	free food and alcohol,
83.872	also some air-gun target practice
86.762	using mainstream politicians'
86.762	faces as targets.
90.44	And this seemed like a very,
90.44	actually, friendly, inclusive group
94.191	until you started talking or mentioning
94.191	anything to do with the Roma population,
99.628	Jewish people or immigrants,
101.914	and then the discourse would become
101.914	very hate-based very quickly.
106.663	So it led me into my work now,
109.497	where we pose the question,
111.902	"""Why do people join"
111.902	violent extremist movements,
114.966	and how do we effectively
114.966	"counter these processes?"""
118.393	In the aftermath of horrible
118.393	atrocities and attacks
121.708	in places like Belgium, France,
121.708	but all over the world,
125.095	sometimes it's easier for us to think,
126.952	"""Well, these must be sociopaths,"
128.921	these must be naturally
128.921	violent individuals.
132.009	They must have something wrong
132.009	"with their upbringing."""
134.629	And what's really tragic
136.74	is that oftentimes there's no one profile.
138.955	Many people come
138.955	from educated backgrounds,
142.233	different socioeconomic backgrounds,
144.353	men and women, different ages,
147.225	some with families, some single.
149.527	So why? What is this allure?
152.206	And this is what
152.206	I want to talk you through,
154.279	as well as how do we
154.279	challenge this in a modern era?
158.531	We do know, through research,
160.038	that there are quite a number
160.038	of different things
162.418	that affect somebody's
162.418	process of radicalization,
165.793	and we categorize these
165.793	into push and pull factors.
168.587	And these are pretty much similar
168.587	for Far Right, neo-Nazi groups
172.024	all the way to Islamist extremist
172.024	and terrorist groups.
175.483	And push factors are basically
175.483	what makes you vulnerable
179.365	to a process of radicalization,
181.247	to joining a violent extremist group.
183.477	And these can be
183.477	a lot of different things,
185.627	but roughly, a sense of alienation,
185.627	a sense of isolation,
189.564	questioning your own identity,
191.739	but also feeling that your in-group
191.739	is under attack,
194.589	and your in group might be based
194.589	on a nationality or an ethnicity
198.406	or a religion,
199.756	and feeling that larger powers around you
199.756	are doing nothing to help.
203.895	Now, push factors alone
203.895	do not make you a violent extremist,
207.34	because if that were the fact,
208.794	those same factors would go
208.794	towards a group like the Roma population,
212.088	and they're not
212.088	a violently mobilized group.
214.893	So we have to look at the pull factors.
217.204	What are these violent
217.204	extremist organizations offering
220.538	that other groups are not offering?
222.507	And actually, this is usually
222.507	very positive things,
225.094	very seemingly empowering things,
227.135	such as brotherhood and sisterhood
229.622	and a sense of belonging,
230.98	as well as giving somebody
230.98	a spiritual purpose,
233.878	a divine purpose
233.878	to build a utopian society
237.617	if their goals can be met,
239.562	but also a sense of empowerment
239.562	and adventure.
242.337	When we look
242.337	at foreign terrorist fighters,
244.404	we see young men
244.404	with the wind in their hair
247.119	out in the desert
247.119	and women going to join them
249.689	to have nuptials out in the sunset.
252.354	It's very romantic, and you become a hero.
256.198	For both men and women,
256.198	that's the propaganda being given.
259.487	So what extremist groups are very good at
262.153	is taking a very complicated,
262.153	confusing, nuanced world
267.003	and simplifying that world
267.003	into black and white,
270.27	good and evil.
271.504	And you become what is good,
273.409	challenging what is evil.
276.361	So I want to talk a little bit
276.361	about ISIS, Daesh,
280.249	because they have been a game changer
280.249	in how we look at these processes,
284.651	and through a lot of the material
284.651	and their tactics.
287.881	They're very much a modern movement.
290.745	One of the aspects is the internet
290.745	and the usage of social media,
295.254	as we've all seen in headlines
295.254	tweeting and videos of beheadings.
299.66	But the internet alone
299.66	does not radicalize you.
302.159	The internet is a tool.
303.39	You don't go online shopping for shoes
305.27	and accidentally become a jihadist.
307.613	However, what the Internet
307.613	does do is it is a catalyst.
311.026	It provides tools and scale and rapidity
315.169	that doesn't exist elsewhere.
316.701	And with ISIS, all of a sudden,
319.186	this idea of a cloaked, dark figure
319.186	of a jihadist changed for us.
324.528	All of a sudden,
324.528	we were in their kitchens.
326.607	We saw what they were eating for dinner.
328.63	They were tweeting.
329.805	We had foreign terrorist fighters
329.805	tweeting in their own languages.
332.987	We had women going out there
332.987	talking about their wedding day,
335.963	about the births of their children.
337.734	We had gaming culture, all of a sudden,
339.655	and references
339.655	to Grand Theft Auto being made.
343.291	So all of a sudden, they were homey.
345.776	They became human.
346.951	And the problem
346.951	is that trying to counter it,
349.189	lots of governments
349.189	and social media companies
351.523	just tried to censor.
352.698	How do we get rid of terrorist content?
354.713	And it became a cat-and-mouse game
356.392	where we would see accounts taken down
356.392	and they'd just come back up,
359.62	and an arrogance around somebody
359.62	having a 25th account
362.757	and material that was
362.757	disseminated everywhere.
365.875	But we also saw a dangerous trend --
367.92	violent extremists know the rules
367.92	and regulations of social media, too.
372.952	So we would see a banal
372.952	conversation with a recruiter
376.976	start on a mainstream platform,
378.973	and at the point
378.973	at which that conversation
381.078	was going to become illegal,
382.442	they would jump to a smaller,
382.442	less regulated,
384.967	more encrypted platform.
386.614	So all of a sudden, we couldn't
386.614	track where that conversation went.
390.171	So this is a problem with censorship,
392.057	which is why we need to develop
392.057	alternatives to censorship.
395.855	ISIS is also a game-changer
395.855	because it's state-building.
399.229	It's not just recruiting combatants;
401.365	it's trying to build a state.
403.251	And what that means is all of a sudden,
405.215	your recruitment model is much more broad.
407.239	You're not just trying to get fighters --
409.312	now you need architects, engineers,
409.312	accountants, hackers and women.
413.602	We've actually seen
413.602	a huge increase of women going
416.016	in the last 24, but especially 12 months.
419.539	Some countries, one in four
419.539	of the people going over to join
422.452	are now women.
423.715	And so, this really changes
425.107	who we're trying to counter
425.107	this process with.
428.499	Now, not all doom and gloom.
430.174	So the rest I'd like to talk about
430.174	some of the positive things
433.158	and the new innovation in trying
433.158	to prevent and counter violent extremism.
437.026	Preventing is very different
437.026	than countering,
439.323	and actually, you can think of it
439.323	in medical terms.
441.903	So preventative medicine is,
444.149	how do we make it
444.149	so you are naturally resilient
447.347	to this process of radicalization,
449.871	whereas that is going to be different
451.757	if somebody is already showing
451.757	a symptom or a sign
454.44	of belonging to a violent
454.44	extremist ideology.
457.345	And so in preventative measures,
458.916	we're talking more
458.916	about really broad groups of people
461.631	and exposure to ideas
463.472	to make them resilient.
465.263	Whereas it's very different
466.803	if somebody is starting to question
466.803	and agree with certain things online,
470.652	and it's also very different
470.652	if somebody already has a swastika tattoo
474.525	and is very much embedded within a group.
476.597	How do you reach them?
478.605	So I'd like to go through three examples
478.605	of each one of those levels
482.311	and talk you through
483.55	what some of the new ways
483.55	of engaging with people are becoming.
487.194	"One is ""Extreme Dialogue,"""
488.631	and it's an educational program
488.631	that we helped develop.
491.735	This one is from Canada,
494.14	and it's meant to create dialogues
494.14	within a classroom setting,
498.259	using storytelling,
499.815	because violent extremism
499.815	can be very hard to try to explain,
502.99	especially to younger individuals.
505.125	So we have a network of former extremists
505.125	and survivors of extremism
509.062	that tell their stories through video
509.062	and create question-giving to classrooms,
513.023	to start a conversation about the topic.
515.35	These two examples show Christianne,
517.906	who lost her son,
519.081	who radicalized and died
519.081	fighting for ISIS,
521.598	and Daniel is a former neo-Nazi
523.289	who was an extremely violent neo-Nazi,
525.671	and they pose questions about their lives
525.671	and where they're at and regret,
529.853	and force a classroom
529.853	to have a dialogue around it.
532.995	Now, looking at that middle range
532.995	of individuals,
536.004	actually, we need a lot
536.004	of civil society voices.
538.727	How do you interact with people
538.727	that are looking for information online,
542.196	that are starting to toy with an ideology,
544.562	that are doing those searching
544.562	identity questions?
547.65	How do we provide alternatives for that?
549.816	And that's when we combine
549.816	large groups of civil society voices
553.23	with creatives, techies,
553.23	app developers, artists, comedians,
557.785	and we can create really specified content
560.492	and actually, online, disseminate it
560.492	to very strategic audiences.
564.81	So one example would be
564.81	creating a satirical video
567.637	which makes fun of Islamophobia,
570.16	and targeting it
570.16	to 15- to 20-year-olds online
574.12	that have an interest in white power music
576.391	and live specifically in Manchester.
578.814	We can use these marketing tools
578.814	to be very specific,
581.869	so that we know
581.869	when somebody's viewing, watching
584.616	and engaging with that content,
586.129	it's not just the average person,
586.129	it's not me or you --
588.783	it's a very specific audience
588.783	that we are looking to engage with.
592.524	Even more downstream, we developed
592.524	"a pilot program called ""One to One,"""
596.247	where we took former extremists
597.82	and we had them reach out directly
597.82	to a group of labeled neofascists
602.708	as well as Islamist extremists,
604.356	and put direct messages through Facebook
604.356	Messenger into their inbox, saying,
608.195	"""Hey, I see where you're going."
608.195	I've been there.
610.505	"If you want to talk, I'm here."""
612.071	Now, we kind of expected death threats
612.071	from this sort of interaction.
615.349	It's a little alarming to have
615.349	"a former neo-Nazi say, ""Hey, how are you?"""
619.793	But actually, we found
619.793	that around 60 percent
622.024	of the people reached out to responded,
624.602	and of that, around another 60 percent
624.602	had sustained engagement,
628.711	meaning that they were
628.711	having conversations
630.791	with the hardest people to reach
630.791	about what they were going through,
634.031	planting seeds of doubt
635.206	and giving them alternatives
635.206	for talking about these subjects,
638.222	and that's really important.
640.881	So what we're trying to do
643.128	is actually bring
643.128	unlikely sectors to the table.
646.057	We have amazing activists
646.057	all over the world,
648.407	but oftentimes,
648.407	their messages are not strategic
650.797	or they don't actually reach
650.797	the audiences they want to reach.
653.727	So we work with networks
653.727	of former extremists.
655.99	We work with networks of young people
655.99	in different parts of the world.
659.443	And we work with them
659.443	to bring the tech sector to the table
662.237	with artists and creatives
662.237	and marketing expertise
665.079	so that we can actually have
665.079	a more robust and challenging of extremism
670.104	that works together.
671.894	So I would say
671.894	that if you are in the audience
674.498	and you happen to be a graphic designer,
677.221	a poet, a marketing expert,
679.427	somebody that works in PR,
681.36	a comedian --
682.737	you might not think
682.737	that this is your sector,
684.912	but actually, the skills
684.912	that you have right now
687.675	might be exactly what is needed
689.702	to help challenge extremism effectively.
692.035	Thank you.
693.21	(Applause)
