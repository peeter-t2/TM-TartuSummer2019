12.902	I come to you today to speak of liars,
17.009	lawsuits
18.456	and laughter.
20.73	The first time I heard
20.73	about Holocaust denial,
23.864	I laughed.
25.79	Holocaust denial?
28.007	The Holocaust which has
28.007	the dubious distinction
31.461	of being the best-documented
31.461	genocide in the world?
36.866	Who could believe it didn't happen?
39.926	Think about it.
42.077	For deniers to be right,
44.382	who would have to be wrong?
46.831	Well, first of all, the victims --
49.621	the survivors who have told us
49.621	their harrowing stories.
55.541	Who else would have to be wrong?
57.879	The bystanders.
59.856	The people who lived in the myriads
59.856	of towns and villages and cities
63.858	on the Eastern front,
65.854	who watched their neighbors
65.854	be rounded up --
68.32	men, women, children, young, old --
71.557	and be marched
71.557	to the outskirts of the town
74.301	to be shot and left dead in ditches.
77.805	Or the Poles,
79.159	who lived in towns and villages
79.159	around the death camps,
83.864	who watched day after day
86.264	as the trains went in filled with people
89.03	and came out empty.
91.607	But above all, who would have to be wrong?
95.825	The perpetrators.
97.932	"The people who say, ""We did it."
101.299	"I did it."""
102.847	Now, maybe they add a caveat.
105.02	"They say, ""I didn't have a choice;"
105.02	"I was forced to do it."""
109.924	"But nonetheless, they say, ""I did it."""
113.758	Think about it.
115.333	In not one war crimes trial
115.333	since the end of World War II
121.296	has a perpetrator of any nationality
121.296	"ever said, ""It didn't happen."""
128.898	"Again, they may have said, ""I was forced,"""
128.898	but never that it didn't happen.
133.504	Having thought that through,
135.002	I decided denial was not
135.002	going to be on my agenda;
138.977	I had bigger things to worry about,
138.977	to write about, to research,
142.709	and I moved on.
144.731	Fast-forward a little over a decade,
147.574	and two senior scholars --
149.41	two of the most prominent historians
149.41	of the Holocaust --
152.592	approached me and said,
153.873	"""Deborah, let's have coffee."
155.686	We have a research idea
155.686	"that we think is perfect for you."""
159.307	Intrigued and flattered
159.307	that they came to me with an idea
163.164	and thought me worthy of it,
164.765	"I asked, ""What is it?"""
167.485	"And they said, ""Holocaust denial."""
171.173	And for the second time, I laughed.
174.156	Holocaust denial?
176.104	The Flat Earth folks?
178.114	The Elvis-is-alive people?
180.275	I should study them?
183.146	And these two guys said,
184.487	"""Yeah, we're intrigued."
186.832	What are they about?
188.428	What's their objective?
190.202	How do they manage to get people
190.202	"to believe what they say?"""
194.576	So thinking, if they thought
194.576	it was worthwhile,
198.128	I would take a momentary diversion --
201.526	maybe a year, maybe two,
201.526	three, maybe even four --
204.488	in academic terms, that's momentary.
206.757	(Laughter)
207.923	We work very slowly.
210.334	(Laughter)
211.93	And I would look at them.
213.756	So I did.
214.935	I did my research, and I came up
214.935	with a number of things,
217.798	two of which I'd like to share
217.798	with you today.
220.415	One:
221.772	deniers are wolves in sheep's clothing.
227.532	They are the same: Nazis, neo-Nazis --
230.521	you can decide whether you want
230.521	"to put a ""neo"" there or not."
234.606	But when I looked at them,
236.963	I didn't see any SS-like uniforms,
241.713	swastika-like symbols on the wall,
244.888	Sieg Heil salutes --
246.969	none of that.
248.537	What I found instead
251.431	were people parading
251.431	as respectable academics.
256.736	What did they have?
257.981	They had an institute.
259.703	"An ""Institute for Historical Review."""
264.212	They had a journal -- a slick journal --
266.79	"a ""Journal of Historical Review."""
270.218	One filled with papers --
272.948	footnote-laden papers.
275.743	And they had a new name.
278.32	Not neo-Nazis,
280.512	not anti-Semites --
283.026	revisionists.
284.811	"They said, ""We are revisionists."
287.05	We are out to do one thing:
289.757	"to revise mistakes in history."""
294.189	But all you had to do was go
294.189	one inch below the surface,
299.623	and what did you find there?
301.554	The same adulation of Hitler,
304.068	praise of the Third Reich,
305.967	anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice.
309.724	This is what intrigued me.
312.194	It was anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice,
312.194	parading as rational discourse.
320.55	The other thing I found --
322.161	many of us have been taught to think
322.161	there are facts and there are opinions --
325.93	after studying deniers,
327.41	I think differently.
329.258	There are facts,
330.93	there are opinions,
332.668	and there are lies.
334.969	And what deniers want to do
334.969	is take their lies,
340.385	dress them up as opinions --
342.041	maybe edgy opinions,
344.055	maybe sort of out-of-the-box opinions --
346.788	but then if they're opinions,
348.196	they should be part of the conversation.
350.352	And then they encroach on the facts.
355.125	I published my work --
356.712	the book was published,
357.91	"""Denying the Holocaust: The Growing"
357.91	"Assault on Truth and Memory,"""
361.336	it came out in many different countries,
363.316	including here in Penguin UK,
365.5	and I was done with those folks
365.5	and ready to move on.
369.983	Then came the letter from Penguin UK.
374.254	And for the third time, I laughed ...
378.908	mistakenly.
380.792	I opened the letter,
382.546	and it informed me that David Irving
382.546	was bringing a libel suit against me
388.458	in the United Kingdom
390.079	for calling him a Holocaust denier.
393.773	David Irving suing me?
395.731	Who was David Irving?
396.959	David Irving was a writer
396.959	of historical works,
399.59	most of them about World War II,
401.637	and virtually all of those works
401.637	took the position
404.88	that the Nazis were really not so bad,
408.482	and the Allies were really not so good.
411.59	And the Jews, whatever happened to them,
413.719	they sort of deserved it.
416.026	He knew the documents,
417.541	he knew the facts,
419.008	but he somehow twisted them
419.008	to get this opinion.
422.836	He hadn't always been a Holocaust denier,
425.372	but in the late '80s,
427.137	he embraced it with great vigor.
431.337	The reason I laughed also
431.337	was this was a man
435.266	who not only was a Holocaust denier,
437.224	but seemed quite proud of it.
438.943	Here was a man -- and I quote --
440.591	"who said, ""I'm going to sink"
440.591	"the battleship Auschwitz."""
445.165	Here was a man
446.361	who pointed to the number tattooed
446.361	on a survivor's arm and said,
451.536	"""How much money have you made"
453.152	from having that number
453.152	"tattooed on your arm?"""
457.369	Here was a man who said,
459.301	"""More people died in Senator Kennedy's car"
462.281	at Chappaquiddick
463.617	"than died in gas chambers at Auschwitz."""
466.955	That's an American reference,
466.955	but you can look it up.
471.226	This was not a man who seemed
471.226	at all ashamed or reticent
474.264	about being a Holocaust denier.
476.956	Now, lots of my academic
476.956	colleagues counseled me --
480.76	"""Eh, Deborah, just ignore it."""
482.69	When I explained you can't just
482.69	ignore a libel suit,
486.302	"they said, ""Who's going to"
486.302	"believe him anyway?"""
489.603	But here was the problem:
491.707	British law put the onus,
491.707	put the burden of proof on me
497.039	to prove the truth of what I said,
499.745	in contrast to as it would have
499.745	been in the United States
502.532	and in many other countries:
504.06	on him to prove the falsehood.
507.741	What did that mean?
509.226	That meant if I didn't fight,
512.626	he would win by default.
515.611	And if he won by default,
517.39	he could then legitimately say,
520.055	"""My David Irving version of the Holocaust"
520.055	is a legitimate version.
525.415	Deborah Lipstadt was found
525.415	to have libeled me
527.623	when she called me a Holocaust denier.
529.594	Ipso facto, I, David Irving,
529.594	"am not a Holocaust denier."""
534.046	And what is that version?
536.251	There was no plan to murder the Jews,
539.271	there were no gas chambers,
541.347	there were no mass shootings,
543.227	Hitler had nothing to do
543.227	with any suffering that went on,
546.422	and the Jews have made this all up
550.251	to get money from Germany
552.673	and to get a state,
554.404	and they've done it with the aid
554.404	and abettance of the Allies --
557.805	they've planted the documents
557.805	and planted the evidence.
562.28	I couldn't let that stand
564.684	and ever face a survivor
567.643	or a child of survivors.
569.642	I couldn't let that stand
571.818	and consider myself
571.818	a responsible historian.
577.007	So we fought.
578.776	And for those of you
578.776	"who haven't seen ""Denial,"""
581.082	spoiler alert:
582.265	we won.
583.507	(Laughter)
584.826	(Applause)
591.808	The judge found David Irving
596.073	to be a liar,
599.428	a racist,
600.615	an anti-Semite.
601.893	His view of history was tendentious,
604.277	he lied, he distorted --
606.227	and most importantly,
608.894	he did it deliberately.
611.031	We showed a pattern,
611.031	in over 25 different major instances.
615.194	Not small things -- many of us
615.194	in this audience write books,
618.328	are writing books;
619.537	we always make mistakes, that's why
619.537	we're glad to have second editions:
623.027	correct the mistakes.
624.237	(Laughter)
626.454	But these always moved
626.454	in the same direction:
630.438	blame the Jews,
632.673	exonerate the Nazis.
635.52	But how did we win?
638.016	What we did is follow his footnotes
638.016	back to his sources.
644.01	And what did we find?
645.817	Not in most cases,
647.32	and not in the preponderance of cases,
649.312	but in every single instance where
649.312	he made some reference to the Holocaust,
653.647	that his supposed evidence was distorted,
657.913	half-truth,
659.357	date-changed,
660.715	sequence-changed,
662.926	someone put at a meeting who wasn't there.
665.074	In other words,
665.074	he didn't have the evidence.
667.859	His evidence didn't prove it.
669.992	We didn't prove what happened.
673.448	We proved that what he said happened --
675.971	and by extension, all deniers,
675.971	because he either quotes them
678.855	or they get their arguments from him --
681.35	is not true.
682.62	What they claim --
683.833	they don't have the evidence to prove it.
688.429	So why is my story
688.429	more than just the story
693.197	of a quirky, long,
693.197	six-year, difficult lawsuit,
697.028	an American professor
697.028	being dragged into a courtroom
702.041	by a man that the court
702.041	declared in its judgment
705.109	was a neo-Nazi polemicist?
707.383	What message does it have?
709.62	I think in the context
709.62	of the question of truth,
712.617	it has a very significant message.
715.103	Because today,
716.912	as we well know,
718.602	truth and facts are under assault.
723.522	Social media, for all
723.522	the gifts it has given us,
726.798	has also allowed the difference
726.798	between facts -- established facts --
732.403	and lies
734.184	to be flattened.
736.81	Third of all:
738.344	extremism.
740.807	You may not see Ku Klux Klan robes,
744.408	you may not see burning crosses,
746.503	you may not even hear outright
746.503	white supremacist language.
750.846	"It may go by names: ""alt-right,"""
750.846	"""National Front"" -- pick your names."
755.776	But underneath, it's that same extremism
755.776	that I found in Holocaust denial
761.635	parading as rational discourse.
766.954	We live in an age
766.954	where truth is on the defensive.
772.195	I'm reminded of a New Yorker cartoon.
774.703	A quiz show recently appeared
774.703	"in ""The New Yorker"""
777.247	where the host of the quiz show
777.247	is saying to one of the contestants,
780.493	"""Yes, ma'am, you had the right answer."
782.826	But your opponent yelled
782.826	more loudly than you did,
785.343	"so he gets the point."""
788.048	What can we do?
790.377	First of all,
791.778	we cannot be beguiled
791.778	by rational appearances.
797.233	We've got to look underneath,
799.026	and we will find there the extremism.
802.811	Second of all,
804.821	we must understand
804.821	that truth is not relative.
812.957	Number three,
814.445	we must go on the offensive,
818.158	not the defensive.
820.496	When someone makes an outrageous claim,
823.127	even though they may hold
823.127	one of the highest offices in the land,
826.655	if not the world --
828.69	we must say to them,
830.224	"""Where's the proof?"
832.214	"Where's the evidence?"""
834.375	We must hold their feet to the fire.
837.326	We must not treat it as if their lies
837.326	are the same as the facts.
843.215	And as I said earlier,
843.215	truth is not relative.
846.779	Many of us have grown up
846.779	in the world of the academy
849.659	and enlightened liberal thought,
851.424	where we're taught
851.424	everything is open to debate.
854.984	But that's not the case.
857.022	There are certain things that are true.
861.012	There are indisputable facts --
864.056	objective truths.
866.339	Galileo taught it to us centuries ago.
871.18	Even after being forced
871.18	to recant by the Vatican
875.871	that the Earth moved around the Sun,
878.468	he came out,
879.646	and what is he reported to have said?
881.98	"""And yet, it still moves."""
887.162	The Earth is not flat.
890.026	The climate is changing.
893.207	Elvis is not alive.
895.499	(Laughter)
897.058	(Applause)
899.398	And most importantly,
901.723	truth and fact are under assault.
907.109	The job ahead of us,
908.743	the task ahead of us,
909.97	the challenge ahead of us
911.588	is great.
913.567	The time to fight is short.
917.061	We must act now.
920.749	Later will be too late.
924.018	Thank you very much.
925.304	(Applause)
