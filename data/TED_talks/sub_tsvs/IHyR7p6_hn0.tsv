16.061	There have been many revolutions
16.061	over the last century,
19.457	but perhaps none as significant
19.457	as the longevity revolution.
24.502	We are living on average
24.502	today 34 years longer
28.876	than our great-grandparents did --
28.876	think about that.
31.378	That's an entire second adult lifetime
34.656	that's been added to our lifespan.
36.994	And yet, for the most part,
38.365	our culture has not come to terms
38.365	with what this means.
41.76	We're still living with the old paradigm
44.549	of age as an arch.
46.55	That's the metaphor, the old metaphor.
48.49	You're born, you peak at midlife
50.624	and decline into decrepitude.
52.76	(Laughter)
54.457	Age as pathology.
57.464	But many people today -- philosophers,
57.464	artists, doctors, scientists --
61.76	are taking a new look
61.76	"at what I call ""the third act"" --"
65.108	the last three decades of life.
67.624	They realize that this is actually
67.624	a developmental stage of life
72.76	with its own significance,
75.174	as different from midlife
75.174	as adolescence is from childhood.
80.992	And they are asking --
80.992	we should all be asking:
84.369	How do we use this time?
86.944	How do we live it successfully?
88.896	What is the appropriate
88.896	new metaphor for aging?
92.854	I've spent the last year researching
92.854	and writing about this subject.
96.489	And I have come to find
96.489	that a more appropriate metaphor for aging
101.76	is a staircase --
104.331	the upward ascension of the human spirit,
107.442	bringing us into wisdom,
107.442	wholeness, and authenticity.
111.76	Age not at all as pathology.
114.093	Age as potential.
115.76	And guess what?
117.203	This potential is not for the lucky few.
119.867	It turns out, most people over 50
123.96	feel better, are less stressed,
123.96	less hostile, less anxious.
128.271	We tend to see commonalities
128.271	more than differences.
131.761	Some of the studies even say
131.761	we're happier.
134.595	(Laughter)
135.649	This is not what I expected, trust me.
138.393	I come from a long line of depressives.
141.188	As I was approaching my late 40s,
143.532	when I would wake up in the morning,
145.349	my first six thoughts
145.349	would all be negative.
147.804	And I got scared.
148.99	"I thought, ""Oh my gosh."
148.99	"I'm going to become a crotchety old lady."""
152.76	But now that I am actually smack-dab
152.76	in the middle of my own third act,
157.325	I realize I've never been happier.
160.402	I have such a powerful
160.402	feeling of well-being.
164.784	And I've discovered
166.636	that when you're inside oldness,
168.637	as opposed to looking
168.637	at it from the outside,
171.014	fear subsides.
172.308	You realize you're still yourself --
174.664	maybe even more so.
176.53	"Picasso once said, ""It takes"
176.53	"a long time to become young."""
180.774	(Laughter)
182.966	I don't want to romanticize aging.
184.84	Obviously, there's no guarantee
186.539	that it can be a time
186.539	of fruition and growth.
189.681	Some of it is a matter of luck.
191.365	Some of it, obviously, is genetic.
193.929	One third of it, in fact, is genetic.
196.077	And there isn't much we can do about that.
198.815	But that means that two-thirds
198.815	of how well we do in the third act,
203.734	we can do something about.
206.241	We're going to discuss what we can do
208.531	to make these added years
208.531	really successful,
211.958	and use them to make a difference.
215.108	Now, let me say something
215.108	about the staircase,
217.324	which may seem like an odd
217.324	metaphor for seniors,
221.365	given the fact that many seniors
221.365	are challenged by stairs.
224.352	(Laughter)
225.69	Myself included.
229.148	As you may know, the entire world
229.148	operates on a universal law:
234.403	entropy, the second law of thermodynamics.
237.934	Entropy means that everything
237.934	in the world -- everything --
240.847	is in a state of decline and decay --
243.033	the arch.
244.649	There's only one exception
244.649	to this universal law,
248.448	and that is the human spirit,
250.64	which can continue to evolve
250.64	upwards, the staircase,
254.736	bringing us into wholeness,
254.736	authenticity, and wisdom.
259.664	And here's an example of what I mean.
262.179	This upward ascension
264.26	can happen even in the face
264.26	of extreme physical challenges.
267.819	About three years ago,
267.819	I read an article in the New York Times.
272.132	It was about a man named Neil Selinger --
276.898	who had joined the writers'
276.898	group at Sarah Lawrence,
279.997	where he found his writer's voice.
282.836	Two years later,
284.077	he was diagnosed with ALS,
284.077	commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
288.427	It's a terrible disease. It's fatal.
290.814	It wastes the body,
290.814	but the mind remains intact.
294.887	In this article,
294.887	Mr. Selinger wrote the following
298.26	to describe what was happening to him.
301.529	And I quote:
303.632	"""As my muscles weakened,"
306.26	my writing became stronger.
308.99	As I slowly lost my speech,
311.972	I gained my voice.
314.466	As I diminished, I grew.
317.14	As I lost so much,
319.001	"I finally started to find myself."""
323.692	Neil Selinger, to me,
324.968	is the embodiment
324.968	of mounting the staircase
328.373	in his third act.
330.902	Now we're all born with spirit, all of us,
333.664	but sometimes it gets tamped down
333.664	beneath the challenges of life,
337.832	violence, abuse, neglect.
340.767	Perhaps our parents
340.767	suffered from depression.
343.371	Perhaps they weren't able to love us
343.371	beyond how we performed in the world.
349.196	Perhaps we still suffer
349.196	from a psychic pain, a wound.
353.26	Perhaps we feel
353.26	that many of our relationships
355.849	have not had closure.
357.26	And so we can feel unfinished.
360.823	Perhaps the task of the third act
364.391	is to finish up the task
364.391	of finishing ourselves.
368.665	For me, it began as I was approaching
368.665	my third act, my 60th birthday.
374.902	How was I supposed to live it?
376.823	What was I supposed to accomplish
376.823	in this final act?
379.759	And I realized that,
379.759	in order to know where I was going,
383.942	I had to know where I'd been.
386.109	And so I went back
386.109	and I studied my first two acts,
390.26	trying to see who I was then,
392.907	who I really was, not who my parents
392.907	or other people told me I was,
398.374	or treated me like I was.
400.024	But who was I?
401.216	Who were my parents --
401.216	not as parents, but as people?
405.013	Who were my grandparents?
406.742	How did they treat my parents?
408.532	These kinds of things.
412.565	I discovered, a couple of years later,
415.199	that this process that I had gone through
418.2	is called by psychologists
418.2	"""doing a life review."""
421.964	And they say it can give new significance
421.964	and clarity and meaning
425.854	to a person's life.
427.95	You may discover, as I did,
430.646	that a lot of things
430.646	that you used to think were your fault,
434.586	a lot of things you used
434.586	to think about yourself,
437.395	really had nothing to do with you.
440.26	It wasn't your fault; you're just fine.
443.54	And you're able to go back
443.54	and forgive them.
447.26	And forgive yourself.
449.219	You're able to free yourself
452.406	from your past.
454.172	You can work to change
454.172	your relationship to your past.
458.394	Now while I was writing about this,
460.321	I came upon a book called
460.321	"""Man's Search for Meaning"""
463.557	by Viktor Frankl.
465.082	Viktor Frankl was a German psychiatrist
467.681	who'd spent five years
467.681	in a Nazi concentration camp.
470.982	And he wrote that,
470.982	while he was in the camp,
473.934	he could tell, should
473.934	they ever be released,
477.411	which of the people would be OK,
477.411	and which would not.
482.22	And he wrote this:
487.375	"""Everything you have in life"
487.375	can be taken from you
490.048	except one thing:
492.164	your freedom to choose
492.164	how you will respond to the situation.
498.26	This is what determines
498.26	the quality of the life we've lived --
501.934	not whether we've been rich or poor,
504.014	famous or unknown,
505.77	healthy or suffering.
507.974	What determines our quality of life
507.974	is how we relate to these realities,
513.647	what kind of meaning we assign them,
515.823	what kind of attitude
515.823	we cling to about them,
519.014	what state of mind
519.014	"we allow them to trigger."""
523.006	Perhaps the central purpose
523.006	of the third act
525.713	is to go back and to try, if appropriate,
529.714	to change our relationship to the past.
533.974	It turns out that cognitive research shows
537.18	when we are able to do this,
538.984	it manifests neurologically --
541.587	neural pathways are created in the brain.
544.704	You see, if you have, over time,
546.705	reacted negatively
546.705	to past events and people,
550.132	neural pathways are laid down
552.438	by chemical and electrical signals
552.438	that are sent through the brain.
556.236	And over time, these neural pathways
556.236	become hardwired.
559.73	They become the norm --
559.73	even if it's bad for us,
562.58	because it causes us stress and anxiety.
566.189	If, however,
567.673	we can go back and alter our relationship,
571.433	re-vision our relationship
571.433	to past people and events,
575.753	neural pathways can change.
577.726	And if we can maintain
577.726	the more positive feelings
581.708	about the past,
582.889	that becomes the new norm.
584.715	It's like resetting a thermostat.
588.132	It's not having experiences
591.22	that makes us wise.
594.26	It's reflecting on the experiences
594.26	that we've had that makes us wise
599.553	and that helps us become whole,
601.554	brings wisdom and authenticity.
603.791	It helps us become
603.791	what we might have been.
607.665	Women start off whole, don't we?
609.926	I mean, as girls, we're feisty --
609.926	"""Yeah? Who says?"""
612.722	(Laughter)
613.796	We have agency.
614.985	We are the subjects of our own lives.
617.459	But very often,
618.867	many, if not most of us,
618.867	when we hit puberty,
621.476	we start worrying
621.476	about fitting in and being popular.
624.839	And we become the subjects
624.839	and objects of other people's lives.
629.26	But now, in our third acts,
632.03	it may be possible for us
632.03	to circle back to where we started,
637.33	and know it for the first time.
640.229	And if we can do that,
641.666	it will not just be for ourselves.
644.878	Older women are the largest
644.878	demographic in the world.
649.093	If we can go back and redefine ourselves
652.447	and become whole,
654.054	this will create
654.054	a cultural shift in the world,
658.808	and it will give an example
658.808	to younger generations
662.053	so that they can reconceive
662.053	their own lifespan.
664.942	Thank you very much.
666.236	(Applause)
