12.98	It's easy to forget that last night,
16.203	one billion people went to sleep
16.203	without access to electricity.
20.094	One billion people.
22.298	Two and a half billion people
22.298	did not have access to clean cooking fuels
27.553	or clean heating fuels.
30.234	Those are the problems
30.234	in the developing world.
32.982	And it's easy for us not to be empathetic
35.642	with those people
35.642	who seem so distanced from us.
38.331	But even in our own world,
38.331	the developed world,
41.725	we see the tension of stagnant economies
45.234	impacting the lives of people around us.
48.241	We see it in whole pieces of the economy,
51.813	where the people involved
51.813	have lost hope about the future
55.22	and despair about the present.
57.457	We see that in the Brexit vote.
59.546	We see that in the Sanders/Trump
59.546	campaigns in my own country.
63.667	But even in countries as recently
63.667	turning the corner
68.619	towards being in the developed world,
70.463	in China,
71.727	we see the difficulty
71.727	that President Xi has
74.7	as he begins to un-employ so many people
74.7	in his coal and mining industries
80.214	who see no future for themselves.
83.183	As we as a society
83.183	figure out how to manage
86.21	the problems of the developed world
88.187	and the problems of the developing world,
90.259	we have to look at how we move forward
93.131	and manage the environmental impact
93.131	of those decisions.
97.868	We've been working on this problem
97.868	for 25 years, since Rio,
100.991	the Kyoto Protocols.
103.223	Our most recent move is the Paris treaty,
106.514	and the resulting climate agreements
109.112	that are being ratified
109.112	by nations around the world.
112.045	I think we can be very hopeful
114.256	that those agreements,
114.256	which are bottom-up agreements,
117.418	where nations have said
117.418	what they think they can do,
120.303	are genuine and forthcoming
120.303	for the vast majority of the parties.
124.977	The unfortunate thing
127.205	is that now, as we look
127.205	at the independent analyses
130.756	of what those climate treaties
130.756	are liable to yield,
135.083	the magnitude of the problem
135.083	before us becomes clear.
138.965	This is the United States
138.965	Energy Information Agency's assessment
143.625	of what will happen if the countries
143.625	implement the climate commitments
148.337	that they've made in Paris
150.397	between now and 2040.
153.221	It shows basically CO2 emissions
153.221	around the world
157.465	over the next 30 years.
160.236	There are three things that you need
160.236	to look at and appreciate.
164.177	One, CO2 emissions are expected
164.177	to continue to grow
168.372	for the next 30 years.
171.265	In order to control climate,
174.054	CO2 emissions have to literally go to zero
177.564	because it's the cumulative emissions
177.564	that drive heating on the planet.
182.445	This should tell you that we are losing
182.445	the race to fossil fuels.
187.567	The second thing you should notice
189.454	is that the bulk of the growth
189.454	comes from the developing countries,
193.771	from China, from India,
193.771	from the rest of the world,
196.86	which includes South Africa
196.86	and Indonesia and Brazil,
201.024	as most of these countries
201.024	move their people
204.353	into the lower range of lifestyles
207.288	that we literally take for granted
207.288	in the developed world.
212.495	The final thing that you should notice
214.902	is that each year,
217.394	about 10 gigatons of carbon are getting
217.394	added to the planet's atmosphere,
224.994	and then diffusing into the ocean
224.994	and into the land.
228.011	That's on top of the 550 gigatons
228.011	that are in place today.
234.062	At the end of 30 years,
235.92	we will have put 850 gigatons
235.92	of carbon into the air,
241.171	and that probably goes a long way
243.446	towards locking in a 2-4 degree C increase
243.446	in global mean surface temperatures,
250.14	locking in ocean acidification
253.227	and locking in sea level rise.
256.379	Now, this is a projection made by men
260.197	by the actions of society,
262.863	and it's ours to change, not to accept.
265.912	But the magnitude of the problem
265.912	is something we need to appreciate.
270.648	Different nations make
270.648	different energy choices.
273.115	It's a function
273.115	of their natural resources.
275.466	It's a function of their climate.
277.499	It's a function of the development path
277.499	that they've followed as a society.
282.664	It's a function of where
282.664	on the surface of the planet they are.
286.191	Are they where it's dark
286.191	a lot of the time,
288.715	or are they at the mid-latitudes?
290.989	Many, many, many things
290.989	go into the choices of countries,
295.185	and they each make a different choice.
298.878	The overwhelming thing
298.878	that we need to appreciate
302.064	is the choice that China has made.
304.695	China has made the choice,
307.313	and will make the choice, to run on coal.
310.358	The United States has an alternative.
312.401	It can run on natural gas
314.182	as a result of the inventions
314.182	of fracking and shale gas,
318.031	which we have here.
319.526	They provide an alternative.
322.662	The OECD Europe has a choice.
325.881	It has renewables that it can afford
325.881	to deploy in Germany
328.974	because it's rich enough
328.974	to afford to do it.
331.615	The French and the British
331.615	show interest in nuclear power.
337.702	Eastern Europe, still very heavily
337.702	committed to natural gas and to coal,
342.331	and with natural gas
342.331	that comes from Russia,
345.083	with all of its entanglements.
347.558	China has many fewer choices
350.039	and a much harder row to hoe.
353.557	If you look at China, and you ask yourself
356.613	why has coal been important to it,
358.841	you have to remember what China's done.
361.534	China brought people to power,
361.534	not power to people.
365.38	It didn't do rural electrification.
368.427	It urbanized.
369.954	It urbanized by taking low-cost labor
369.954	and low-cost energy,
374.182	creating export industries
376.123	that could fund a tremendous
376.123	amount of growth.
379.535	If we look at China's path,
381.763	all of us know that prosperity in China
381.763	has dramatically increased.
386.713	In 1980, 80 percent of China's population
391.283	lived below the extreme poverty level,
394.493	below the level of having
394.493	$1.90 per person per day.
398.658	By the year 2000, only 20 percent
398.658	of China's population
404.154	lived below the extreme poverty level --
407.498	a remarkable feat,
409.977	admittedly, with some costs
409.977	in civil liberties
412.368	that would be tough to accept
412.368	in the Western world.
416.548	But the impact of all that wealth
419.479	allowed people to get
419.479	massively better nutrition.
423.484	It allowed water pipes to be placed.
426.223	It allowed sewage pipes to be placed,
428.706	dramatic decrease in diarrheal diseases,
432.59	at the cost of some outdoor air pollution.
436.07	But in 1980, and even today,
438.374	the number one killer in China
438.374	is indoor air pollution,
442.833	because people do not have access
442.833	to clean cooking and heating fuels.
448.066	In fact, in 2040,
451.794	it's still estimated
451.794	that 200 million people in China
456.593	will not have access
456.593	to clean cooking fuels.
461.133	They have a remarkable path to follow.
464.854	India also needs to meet the needs
464.854	of its own people,
469.626	and it's going to do that by burning coal.
472.475	When we look at the EIA's projections
472.475	of coal burning in India,
478.591	India will supply nearly four times
478.591	as much of its energy from coal
483.518	as it will from renewables.
486.962	It's not because they don't know
486.962	the alternatives;
489.839	it's because rich countries
489.839	can do what they choose,
494.162	poor countries do what they must.
498.198	So what can we do to stop
498.198	coal's emissions in time?
502.899	What can we do that changes
502.899	this forecast that's in front of us?
507.535	Because it's a forecast that we can change
507.535	if we have the will to do it.
513.094	First of all, we have to think
513.094	about the magnitude of the problem.
516.537	Between now and 2040,
	are going to be built around the world.
526.085	This week, between one and three
526.085	one-gigawatt coal plants
530.718	are being turned on around the world.
533.817	That's happening regardless
533.817	of what we want,
537.891	because the people
537.891	that rule their countries,
540.423	assessing the interests of their citizens,
542.817	have decided it's in the interest
542.817	of their citizens to do that.
547.335	And that's going to happen
547.335	unless they have a better alternative.
551.726	And every 100 of those plants will use up
555.507	between one percent and three percent
558.662	of the Earth's climate budget.
561.264	So every day that you go home
561.264	thinking that you should do something
564.779	about global warming,
566.594	at the end of that week, remember:
568.55	somebody fired up a coal plant
568.55	that's going to run for 50 years
572.967	and take away your ability to change it.
577.972	What we've forgotten is something
577.972	that Vinod Khosla used to talk about,
581.59	a man of Indian ethnicity
581.59	but an American venture capitalist.
585.339	And he said, back in the early 2000s,
588.188	that if you needed to get
588.188	China and India off of fossil fuels,
592.219	you had to create a technology
592.219	"that passed the ""Chindia test,"""
596.64	"""Chindia"" being the appending"
596.64	of the two words.
599.9	It had to be first of all viable,
602.283	meaning that technically, they could
602.283	implement it in their country,
605.901	and that it would be accepted
605.901	by the people in the country.
610.191	Two, it had to be a technology
610.191	that was scalable,
616.788	that it could deliver the same benefits
619.83	on the same timetable as fossil fuels,
623.387	so that they can enjoy the kind of life,
623.387	again, that we take for granted.
627.766	And third, it had to be cost-effective
630.299	without subsidy or without mandate.
633.432	It had to stand on its own two feet;
636.17	it could not be maintained
636.17	for that many people
640.073	if in fact, those countries
640.073	had to go begging
643.009	or had some foreign country say,
643.009	"""I won't trade with you,"""
647.328	in order to get
647.328	the technology shift to occur.
652.168	If you look at the Chindia test,
653.878	we simply have not come up
653.878	with alternatives that meet that test.
658.984	That's what the EIA forecast tells us.
662.765	China's building 800 gigawatts of coal,
669.772	about 200 gigawatts of nuclear,
672.501	and on an energy-equivalent basis,
672.501	adjusting for intermittency,
676.586	about 100 gigawatts of renewables.
681.805	They're doing that, knowing the costs
681.805	better than any other country,
685.381	knowing the need better
685.381	than any other country.
688.454	But that's what they're aiming for in 2040
691.105	unless we give them a better choice.
694.199	To give them a better choice,
695.663	it's going to have to meet
695.663	the Chindia test.
698.248	If you look at all the alternatives
698.248	that are out there,
700.93	there are really two
700.93	that come near to meeting it.
703.865	First is this area of new nuclear
703.865	that I'll talk about in just a second.
708.107	It's a new generation of nuclear plants
708.107	that are on the drawing boards
711.431	around the world,
712.731	and the people who are
712.731	developing these say
715.093	we can get them
715.093	in position to demo by 2025
719.252	and to scale by 2030,
719.252	if you will just let us.
723.246	The second alternative
723.246	that could be there in time
726.771	is utility-scale solar
726.771	backed up with natural gas,
730.5	which we can use today,
732.248	versus the batteries
732.248	which are still under development.
736.589	So what's holding new nuclear back?
739.686	Outdated regulations
739.686	and yesterday's mindsets.
743.972	We have not used our latest
743.972	scientific thinking on radiological health
748.191	to think how we communicate
748.191	with the public
750.903	and govern the testing
750.903	of new nuclear reactors.
753.729	We have new scientific knowledge
753.729	that we need to use
757.95	in order to improve the way
757.95	we regulate nuclear industry.
762.872	The second thing is we've got a mindset
765.345	that it takes 25 years
765.345	and 2 to 5 billion dollars
768.178	to develop a nuclear power plant.
769.937	That comes from the historical,
769.937	military mindset
774.443	of the places nuclear power came from.
777.356	These new nuclear ventures are saying
779.591	that they can deliver power
779.591	for 5 cents a kilowatt hour;
783.212	they can deliver it
783.212	for 100 gigawatts a year;
786.543	they can demo it by 2025;
789.168	and they can deliver it in scale by 2030,
792.634	if only we give them a chance.
796.064	Right now, we're basically
796.064	waiting for a miracle.
799.888	What we need is a choice.
801.952	If they can't make it safe,
801.952	if they can't make it cheap,
804.78	it should not be deployed.
806.621	But what I want you to do
806.621	is not carry an idea forward,
810.699	but write your leaders,
812.374	write the head of the NGOs you support,
814.776	and tell them to give you the choice,
818.29	not the past.
819.465	Thank you very much.
820.673	(Applause)
