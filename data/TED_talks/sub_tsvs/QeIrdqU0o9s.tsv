12.673	Vision is the most important
15.055	and prioritized sense that we have.
17.643	We are constantly looking
19.327	at the world around us,
21.101	and quickly we identify and make sense
23.298	of what it is that we see.
25.633	Let's just start with an example
27.552	of that very fact.
28.825	I'm going to show you
28.825	a photograph of a person,
30.835	just for a second or two,
32.638	and I'd like for you to identify
34.533	what emotion is on his face.
36.672	Ready?
37.9	Here you go. Go with your gut reaction.
40.612	Okay. What did you see?
42.943	Well, we actually surveyed
45.207	over 120 individuals,
47.514	and the results were mixed.
49.464	People did not agree
51.731	on what emotion they saw on his face.
54.621	Maybe you saw discomfort.
56.426	That was the most frequent response
58.415	that we received.
59.67	But if you asked the person on your left,
61.759	they might have said regret or skepticism,
64.5	and if you asked somebody on your right,
66.429	they might have said
66.429	something entirely different,
69.323	like hope or empathy.
72.143	So we are all looking
73.702	at the very same face again.
76.804	We might see something
78.232	entirely different,
80.615	because perception is subjective.
83.679	What we think we see
85.847	is actually filtered
87.289	through our own mind's eye.
89.693	Of course, there are many other examples
91.946	of how we see the world
91.946	through own mind's eye.
94.361	I'm going to give you just a few.
96.143	So dieters, for instance,
98.803	see apples as larger
100.821	than people who are not counting calories.
103.841	Softball players see the ball as smaller
107.474	if they've just come out of a slump,
109.629	compared to people who 
109.629	had a hot night at the plate.
113.173	And actually, our political beliefs also
116.123	can affect the way we see other people,
118.365	including politicians.
120.538	So my research team and I
120.538	decided to test this question.
124.231	In 2008, Barack Obama
124.231	was running for president
127.862	for the very first time,
129.261	and we surveyed hundreds of Americans
132.243	one month before the election.
134.466	What we found in this survey
136.165	was that some people, some Americans,
138.451	think photographs like these
140.147	best reflect how Obama really looks.
143.139	Of these people, 75 percent
145.761	voted for Obama in the actual election.
148.628	Other people, though,
148.628	thought photographs like these
151.796	best reflect how Obama really looks.
156.061	voted for McCain.
157.882	We presented many photographs of Obama
161.388	one at a time,
162.985	so people did not realize
162.985	that what we were changing
165.884	from one photograph to the next
167.737	was whether we had artificially lightened
169.793	or darkened his skin tone.
172.341	So how is that possible?
173.901	How could it be that
173.901	when I look at a person,
176.736	an object, or an event,
178.457	I see something very different
180.432	than somebody else does?
182.261	Well, the reasons are many,
184.551	but one reason requires that we understand
186.802	a little bit more about how our eyes work.
189.355	So vision scientists know
191.364	that the amount of information
192.847	that we can see
194.718	at any given point in time,
196.557	what we can focus on,
196.557	is actually relatively small.
199.254	What we can see with great sharpness
201.983	and clarity and accuracy
204.16	is the equivalent
206.147	of the surface area of our thumb
208.323	on our outstretched arm.
210.618	Everything else around that is blurry,
212.757	rendering much of what is presented
215.198	to our eyes as ambiguous.
217.842	But we have to clarify
220.116	and make sense of what it is that we see,
222.364	and it's our mind that
222.364	helps us fill in that gap.
225.749	As a result, perception
225.749	is a subjective experience,
229.318	and that's how we end up seeing
230.777	through our own mind's eye.
233.005	So, I'm a social psychologist,
234.818	and it's questions like these
236.335	that really intrigue me.
238.048	I am fascinated by those times
239.699	when people do not see eye to eye.
242.196	Why is it that somebody might
243.893	literally see the glass as half full,
246.505	and somebody literally sees it
247.985	as half empty?
249.456	What is it about what one person
249.456	is thinking and feeling
252.577	that leads them to see the world
254.124	in an entirely different way?
256.484	And does that even matter?
258.947	So to begin to tackle these questions,
261.998	my research team and I
261.998	decided to delve deeply
264.637	into an issue that has received
266.487	international attention:
268.405	our health and fitness.
270.128	Across the world,
271.486	people are struggling
271.486	to manage their weight,
273.888	and there is a variety of strategies
276.102	that we have to help us
276.102	keep the pounds off.
279.459	For instance, we set
279.459	the best of intentions
282.565	to exercise after the holidays,
285.262	but actually, the majority of Americans
287.86	find that their New Year's resolutions
289.902	are broken by Valentine's Day.
292.958	We talk to ourselves
294.46	in very encouraging ways,
296.154	telling ourselves this is our year
297.987	to get back into shape,
299.688	but that is not enough to bring us back
301.53	to our ideal weight.
303.265	So why?
305.101	Of course, there is no simple answer,
307.184	but one reason, I argue,
309.947	is that our mind's eye
311.873	might work against us.
313.474	Some people may literally see exercise
316.493	as more difficult,
318.159	and some people might literally
319.973	see exercise as easier.
322.28	So, as a first step
322.28	to testing these questions,
326.028	we gathered objective measurements
328.291	of individuals' physical fitness.
331.137	We measured the 
331.137	circumference of their waist,
333.479	compared to the 
333.479	circumference of their hips.
336.735	A higher waist-to-hip ratio
338.204	is an indicator of being
338.204	less physically fit
340.387	than a lower waist-to-hip ratio.
342.459	After gathering these measurements,
344.686	we told our participants that
346.499	they would walk to a finish line
348.083	while carrying extra weight
349.966	in a sort of race.
351.123	But before they did that,
352.91	we asked them to estimate the distance
355.35	to the finish line.
357.037	We thought that the physical
357.037	states of their body
359.333	might change how
359.333	they perceived the distance.
362.818	So what did we find?
364.578	Well, waist-to-hip ratio
367.286	predicted perceptions of distance.
370.302	People who were out of shape and unfit
372.932	actually saw the distance
372.932	to the finish line
375.03	as significantly greater
376.193	than people who were in better shape.
378.084	People's states of their own body
380.125	changed how they
380.125	perceived the environment.
383.361	But so too can our mind.
385.477	In fact, our bodies and our minds
387.386	work in tandem
389.363	to change how we see the world around us.
391.971	That led us to think that maybe people
394.066	with strong motivations
395.344	and strong goals to exercise
397.164	might actually see
397.164	the finish line as closer
400.336	than people who have weaker motivations.
404.036	So to test whether motivations
406.378	affect our perceptual
406.378	experiences in this way,
409.73	we conducted a second study.
411.653	Again, we gathered objective measurements
414.334	of people's physical fitness,
416.338	measuring the circumference of their waist
418.396	and the circumference of their hips,
420.164	and we had them do a 
420.164	few other tests of fitness.
423.529	Based on feedback that we gave them,
426.072	some of our participants told us
427.637	they're not motivated
427.637	to exercise any more.
429.945	They felt like they already
429.945	met their fitness goals
432.339	and they weren't going
432.339	to do anything else.
434.472	These people were not motivated.
436.091	Other people, though, 
436.091	based on our feedback,
438.233	told us they were highly 
438.233	motivated to exercise.
440.518	They had a strong goal
440.518	to make it to the finish line.
443.23	But again, before we had them
443.23	walk to the finish line,
446.227	we had them estimate the distance.
448.197	How far away was the finish line?
449.945	And again, like the previous study,
452.307	we found that waist-to-hip ratio
454.141	predicted perceptions of distance.
456.101	Unfit individuals saw
456.101	the distance as farther,
460.733	saw the finish line as farther away,
462.703	than people who were in better shape.
464.65	Importantly, though, this only happened
466.659	for people who were not motivated
468.593	to exercise.
470.212	On the other hand,
471.802	people who were highly
471.802	motivated to exercise
474.846	saw the distance as short.
477.043	Even the most out of shape individuals
479.37	saw the finish line
480.928	as just as close,
482.432	if not slightly closer,
484.267	than people who were in better shape.
486.923	So our bodies can change
488.882	how far away that finish line looks,
491.12	but people who had committed
491.12	to a manageable goal
495.039	that they could accomplish
495.039	in the near future
497.148	and who believed that they were capable
499.342	of meeting that goal
500.938	actually saw the exercise as easier.
504.354	That led us to wonder,
506.264	is there a strategy that we could use
508.681	and teach people that would help
511.071	change their perceptions of the distance,
513.34	help them make exercise look easier?
515.821	So we turned to
515.821	the vision science literature
518.455	to figure out what should we do,
520.201	and based on what we read,
520.201	we came up with a strategy
522.683	"that we called, ""Keep "
522.683	"your eyes on the prize."""
526.061	So this is not the slogan
527.872	from an inspirational poster.
529.757	It's an actual directive
532.005	for how to look around your environment.
534.927	People that we trained in this strategy,
537.219	we told them to focus
537.219	their attention on the finish line,
541.093	to avoid looking around,
542.929	to imagine a spotlight
544.27	was shining on that goal,
545.893	and that everything around it was blurry
548.372	and perhaps difficult to see.
550.178	We thought that this strategy
552.349	would help make the exercise look easier.
554.842	We compared this group
556.461	to a baseline group.
558.119	To this group we said,
559.324	just look around the environment
560.911	as you naturally would.
562.16	You will notice the finish line,
563.72	but you might also notice
565.423	the garbage can off to the right,
567.292	or the people and the 
567.292	lamp post off to the left.
569.578	We thought that people
569.578	who used this strategy
572.263	would see the distance as farther.
574.365	So what did we find?
576.812	When we had them estimate the distance,
578.785	was this strategy successful
580.533	for changing their perceptual experience?
583.033	Yes.
584.231	People who kept their eyes on the prize
586.436	saw the finish line as 30 percent closer
589.485	than people who looked around
591.096	as they naturally would.
592.376	We thought this was great.
593.684	We were really excited because it meant
595.566	that this strategy helped make
597.046	the exercise look easier,
598.938	but the big question was,
600.872	could this help make exercise
602.709	actually better?
604.1	Could it improve the quality
605.765	of exercise as well?
607.646	So next, we told our participants,
609.909	you are going to walk to the finish line
611.804	while wearing extra weight.
614.031	We added weights to their ankles
616.051	that amounted to 15 percent
616.051	of their body weight.
618.748	We told them to lift their knees up high
620.696	and walk to the finish line quickly.
622.915	We designed this exercise in particular
625.075	to be moderately challenging
626.797	but not impossible,
628.574	like most exercises
629.834	that actually improve our fitness.
632.676	So the big question, then:
635.336	Did keeping your eyes on the prize
637.448	and narrowly focusing on the finish line
639.78	change their experience of the exercise?
642.545	It did.
644.14	People who kept their eyes on the prize
646.375	told us afterward that it required
650.284	for them to do this exercise
651.954	than people who looked around naturally.
655.393	It changed their subjective experience
657.457	of the exercise.
659.08	It also changed the objective nature
662.092	of their exercise.
663.391	People who kept their eyes on the prize
665.639	actually moved 23 percent faster
668.287	than people who looked around naturally.
671.735	To put that in perspective,
673.417	a 23 percent increase
675.09	is like trading in your
678.975	for a 1980 Chevrolet Corvette.
683.619	We were so excited by this,
686.131	because this meant that a strategy
688.298	that costs nothing,
689.98	that is easy for people to use,
691.747	regardless of whether they're in shape
693.718	or struggling to get there,
695.576	had a big effect.
697.016	Keeping your eyes on the prize
698.573	made the exercise look and feel easier
701.517	even when people were working harder
704.075	because they were moving faster.
706.294	Now, I know there's more to good health
709.264	than walking a little bit faster,
711.286	but keeping your eyes on the prize
713.471	might be one additional strategy
715.101	that you can use to help promote
716.71	a healthy lifestyle.
719.025	If you're not convinced yet
721.106	that we all see the world
721.106	through our own mind's eye,
723.626	let me leave you with one final example.
725.653	Here's a photograph of a beautiful 
725.653	street in Stockholm, with two cars.
729.076	The car in the back looks much larger
731.267	than the car in the front.
732.693	However, in reality,
734.299	these cars are the same size,
736.678	but that's not how we see it.
739.573	So does this mean that
741.697	our eyes have gone haywire
743.411	and that our brains are a mess?
745.981	No, it doesn't mean that at all.
748.553	It's just how our eyes work.
750.574	We might see the world in a different way,
753.263	and sometimes that might not
755.035	line up with reality,
757.101	but it doesn't mean
757.101	that one of us is right
759.226	and one of us is wrong.
761.321	We all see the world
761.321	through our mind's eye,
763.457	but we can teach ourselves
763.457	to see it differently.
766.308	So I can think of days
768.132	that have gone horribly wrong for me.
770.166	I'm fed up, I'm grumpy, I'm tired,
772.562	and I'm so behind,
774.102	and there's a big black cloud
776.508	hanging over my head,
777.991	and on days like these,
779.425	it looks like everyone around me
781.3	is down in the dumps too.
783.434	My colleague at work looks annoyed
785.167	when I ask for an extension on a deadline,
787.877	and my friend looks frustrated
789.855	when I show up late for lunch
789.855	because a meeting ran long,
792.554	and at the end of the day,
794.147	my husband looks disappointed
796.173	because I'd rather go to 
796.173	bed than go to the movies.
798.706	And on days like these,
798.706	when everybody looks
801.723	upset and angry to me,
803.731	I try to remind myself that there
803.731	are other ways of seeing them.
806.949	Perhaps my colleague was confused,
810.259	perhaps my friend was concerned,
812.695	and perhaps my husband was 
812.695	feeling empathy instead.
815.962	So we all see the world
817.856	through our own mind's eye,
819.682	and on some days, it might look
821.685	like the world is a dangerous
823.093	and challenging and insurmountable place,
825.63	but it doesn't have to look
825.63	that way all the time.
828.6	We can teach ourselves
828.6	to see it differently,
830.796	and when we find a way to make the world
833.462	look nicer and easier,
835.399	it might actually become so.
837.739	Thank you.
839.294	(Applause)
