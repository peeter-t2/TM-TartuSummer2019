12.78	This story begins in 1985,
15.78	when at age 22,
17.78	I became the World Chess Champion
20.18	after beating Anatoly Karpov.
24.3	Earlier that year,
25.58	I played what is called
25.58	simultaneous exhibition
29.22	against 32 of the world's
29.22	best chess-playing machines
33.54	in Hamburg, Germany.
35.98	I won all the games,
38.38	and then it was not considered
38.38	much of a surprise
41.58	that I could beat 32 computers
41.58	at the same time.
46.3	To me, that was the golden age.
48.9	(Laughter)
51.02	Machines were weak,
53.5	and my hair was strong.
54.86	(Laughter)
58.54	Just 12 years later,
60.62	I was fighting for my life
60.62	against just one computer
65.26	in a match
67.18	"called by the cover of ""Newsweek"""
69.26	"""The Brain's Last Stand."""
71.06	No pressure.
72.3	(Laughter)
74.86	From mythology to science fiction,
77.46	human versus machine
80.22	has been often portrayed
80.22	as a matter of life and death.
83.78	John Henry,
85.38	called the steel-driving man
87.1	in the 19th century
87.1	African American folk legend,
90.9	was pitted in a race
92.3	against a steam-powered hammer
95.06	bashing a tunnel through mountain rock.
98.62	John Henry's legend
98.62	is a part of a long historical narrative
103.5	pitting humanity versus technology.
108.02	And this competitive rhetoric
108.02	is standard now.
111.38	We are in a race against the machines,
114.18	in a fight or even in a war.
117.7	Jobs are being killed off.
119.34	People are being replaced
119.34	as if they had vanished from the Earth.
124.06	It's enough to think that the movies
124.06	"like ""The Terminator"" or ""The Matrix"""
127.58	are nonfiction.
131.46	There are very few instances of an arena
137.18	where the human body and mind
137.18	can compete on equal terms
141.459	with a computer or a robot.
144.1	Actually, I wish there were a few more.
147.58	Instead,
149.66	it was my blessing and my curse
154.34	to literally become the proverbial man
157.06	in the man versus machine competition
160.18	that everybody is still talking about.
164.94	In the most famous human-machine
164.94	competition since John Henry,
169.98	I played two matches
172.58	against the IBM supercomputer, Deep Blue.
178.86	Nobody remembers
178.86	that I won the first match --
181.06	(Laughter)
183.42	(Applause)
187.74	In Philadelphia, before losing the rematch
187.74	the following year in New York.
192.74	But I guess that's fair.
196.14	There is no day in history,
196.14	special calendar entry
201.26	for all the people
201.26	who failed to climb Mt. Everest
204.78	before Sir Edmund Hillary
204.78	and Tenzing Norgay
207.54	made it to the top.
209.78	And in 1997, I was still
209.78	the world champion
216.34	when chess computers finally came of age.
221.34	I was Mt. Everest,
223.34	and Deep Blue reached the summit.
226.42	I should say of course,
226.42	not that Deep Blue did it,
230.5	but its human creators --
232.66	Anantharaman, Campbell, Hoane, Hsu.
236.02	Hats off to them.
238.66	As always, machine's triumph
238.66	was a human triumph,
243.1	something we tend to forget when humans
243.1	are surpassed by our own creations.
250.18	Deep Blue was victorious,
253.22	but was it intelligent?
255.18	No, no it wasn't,
258.02	at least not in the way Alan Turing
258.02	and other founders of computer science
263.1	had hoped.
265.06	It turned out that chess
265.06	could be crunched by brute force,
269.86	once hardware got fast enough
274.14	and algorithms got smart enough.
278.58	Although by the definition of the output,
282.3	grandmaster-level chess,
285.54	Deep Blue was intelligent.
289.14	But even at the incredible speed,
297.18	Deep Blue's method
299.18	provided little of the dreamed-of insight
299.18	into the mysteries of human intelligence.
308.78	Soon,
310.62	machines will be taxi drivers
313.22	and doctors and professors,
315.66	"but will they be ""intelligent?"""
319.66	I would rather leave these definitions
322.18	to the philosophers and to the dictionary.
327.26	What really matters is how we humans
332.14	feel about living and working
332.14	with these machines.
337.98	When I first met Deep Blue
337.98	in 1996 in February,
343.26	I had been the world champion
343.26	for more than 10 years,
347.9	and I had played 182
347.9	world championship games
351.94	and hundreds of games against
351.94	other top players in other competitions.
357.06	I knew what to expect from my opponents
362.14	and what to expect from myself.
364.5	I was used to measure their moves
369.7	and to gauge their emotional state
373.34	by watching their body language
373.34	and looking into their eyes.
377.7	And then I sat across
377.7	the chessboard from Deep Blue.
384.78	I immediately sensed something new,
387.66	something unsettling.
391.26	You might experience a similar feeling
395.14	the first time you ride
395.14	in a driverless car
397.7	or the first time your new computer
397.7	manager issues an order at work.
405.62	But when I sat at that first game,
409.9	I couldn't be sure
412.06	what is this thing capable of.
416.74	Technology can advance in leaps,
416.74	and IBM had invested heavily.
420.5	I lost that game.
424.14	And I couldn't help wondering,
425.94	might it be invincible?
428.42	Was my beloved game of chess over?
432.62	These were human doubts, human fears,
436.78	and the only thing I knew for sure
439.22	was that my opponent Deep Blue
439.22	had no such worries at all.
442.14	(Laughter)
445.74	I fought back
448.22	after this devastating blow
450.82	to win the first match,
452.78	but the writing was on the wall.
456.22	I eventually lost to the machine
458.38	but I didn't suffer the fate of John Henry
461.46	who won but died
461.46	with his hammer in his hand.
469.54	It turned out that the world of chess
472.1	still wanted to have
472.1	a human chess champion.
476.74	And even today,
479.9	when a free chess app
479.9	on the latest mobile phone
483.38	is stronger than Deep Blue,
485.42	people are still playing chess,
488.5	even more than ever before.
491.62	Doomsayers predicted
491.62	that nobody would touch the game
494.86	that could be conquered by the machine,
497.14	and they were wrong, proven wrong,
499.38	but doomsaying has always been
499.38	a popular pastime
502.86	when it comes to technology.
506.18	What I learned from my own experience
508.94	is that we must face our fears
513.62	if we want to get the most
513.62	out of our technology,
518.18	and we must conquer those fears
520.58	if we want to get the best
520.58	out of our humanity.
527.94	While licking my wounds,
529.739	I got a lot of inspiration
532.9	from my battles against Deep Blue.
535.619	As the old Russian saying goes,
535.619	if you can't beat them, join them.
540.7	Then I thought,
542.1	what if I could play with a computer --
544.46	together with a computer at my side,
544.46	combining our strengths,
548.98	human intuition
548.98	plus machine's calculation,
552.78	human strategy, machine tactics,
555.5	human experience, machine's memory.
557.94	Could it be the perfect game ever played?
561.82	My idea came to life
564.74	in 1998 under the name of Advanced Chess
568.14	when I played this human-plus-machine
568.14	competition against another elite player.
575.1	But in this first experiment,
577.02	we both failed to combine
577.02	human and machine skills effectively.
586.74	Advanced Chess found
586.74	its home on the internet,
589.98	and in 2005, a so-called
589.98	freestyle chess tournament
594.86	produced a revelation.
599.06	A team of grandmasters
599.06	and top machines participated,
602.62	but the winners were not grandmasters,
605.38	not a supercomputer.
607.5	The winners were a pair
607.5	of amateur American chess players
611.86	operating three ordinary PCs
611.86	at the same time.
617.38	Their skill of coaching their machines
620.42	effectively counteracted
620.42	the superior chess knowledge
626.22	of their grandmaster opponents
627.82	and much greater
627.82	computational power of others.
633.42	And I reached this formulation.
636.38	A weak human player plus a machine
639.78	plus a better process is superior
643.06	to a very powerful machine alone,
645.5	but more remarkably,
645.5	is superior to a strong human player
649.42	plus machine
652.94	and an inferior process.
658.18	This convinced me that we would need
661.82	better interfaces
661.82	to help us coach our machines
666.34	towards more useful intelligence.
670.14	Human plus machine isn't the future,
673.46	it's the present.
674.7	Everybody that's used online translation
678.86	to get the gist of a news article
678.86	from a foreign newspaper,
683.18	knowing its far from perfect.
685.5	Then we use our human experience
687.62	to make sense out of that,
689.74	and then the machine
689.74	learns from our corrections.
692.54	This model is spreading and investing
692.54	in medical diagnosis, security analysis.
698.26	The machine crunches data,
701.14	calculates probabilities,
702.9	gets 80 percent of the way, 90 percent,
706.58	making it easier for analysis
710.98	and decision-making of the human party.
714.1	But you are not going to send your kids
719.82	to school in a self-driving car
719.82	with 90 percent accuracy,
724.42	even with 99 percent.
727.38	So we need a leap forward
730.26	to add a few more crucial decimal places.
738.98	Twenty years after
738.98	my match with Deep Blue,
744.02	second match,
745.66	this sensational
745.66	"""The Brain's Last Stand"" headline"
751.98	has become commonplace
753.58	as intelligent machines
756.14	move
758.38	in every sector, seemingly every day.
761.98	But unlike in the past,
765.1	when machines replaced
768.3	farm animals, manual labor,
770.7	now they are coming
770.7	after people with college degrees
773.22	and political influence.
775.94	And as someone
775.94	who fought machines and lost,
778.06	I am here to tell you
778.06	this is excellent, excellent news.
782.82	Eventually, every profession
785.06	will have to feel these pressures
787.18	or else it will mean humanity
787.18	has ceased to make progress.
794.58	We don't
797.26	get to choose
800.3	when and where
800.3	technological progress stops.
804.98	We cannot
807.78	slow down.
809.3	In fact,
811.14	we have to speed up.
816.42	Our technology excels at removing
821.02	difficulties and uncertainties
821.02	from our lives,
826.82	and so we must seek out
829.66	ever more difficult,
831.54	ever more uncertain challenges.
840.02	Machines have
843.7	calculations.
845.54	We have understanding.
847.14	Machines have instructions.
850.66	We have purpose.
852.54	Machines have
856.9	objectivity.
858.14	We have passion.
860.42	We should not worry
860.42	about what our machines can do today.
866.42	Instead, we should worry
866.42	about what they still cannot do today,
871.02	because we will need the help
871.02	of the new, intelligent machines
876.54	to turn our grandest dreams into reality.
881.82	And if we fail,
884.06	if we fail, it's not because our machines
884.06	are too intelligent,
888.74	or not intelligent enough.
891.02	If we fail, it's because
891.02	we grew complacent
895.5	and limited our ambitions.
898.34	Our humanity is not defined by any skill,
903.1	like swinging a hammer
903.1	or even playing chess.
906.38	There's one thing only a human can do.
909.42	That's dream.
911.94	So let us dream big.
914.5	Thank you.
915.74	(Applause)
