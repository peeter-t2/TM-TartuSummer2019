15.26	Embracing otherness.
18.26	When I first heard this theme,
20.26	I thought, well, embracing otherness
22.26	is embracing myself.
25.26	And the journey to that place
27.26	of understanding and acceptance
29.26	has been an interesting one for me,
32.26	and it's given me an insight
34.26	into the whole notion of self,
36.26	which I think is worth sharing with you today.
40.26	We each have a self,
42.26	but I don't think that we're born with one.
45.26	You know how newborn babies
47.26	believe they're part of everything;
49.26	they're not separate?
51.26	Well that fundamental sense of oneness
54.26	is lost on us very quickly.
56.26	It's like that initial stage is over --
58.26	oneness: infancy,
60.26	unformed, primitive.
62.26	It's no longer valid or real.
65.26	What is real is separateness,
67.26	and at some point in early babyhood,
69.26	the idea of self
71.26	starts to form.
73.26	Our little portion of oneness is given a name,
76.26	is told all kinds of things about itself,
79.26	and these details,
81.26	opinions and ideas
83.26	become facts,
85.26	which go towards building ourselves,
87.26	our identity.
89.26	And that self becomes the vehicle
91.26	for navigating our social world.
94.26	But the self is a projection
97.26	based on other people's projections.
99.26	Is it who we really are?
102.26	Or who we really want to be, or should be?
105.26	So this whole interaction
108.26	with self and identity
110.26	was a very difficult one for me growing up.
112.26	The self that I attempted to take out into the world
115.26	was rejected over and over again.
118.26	And my panic
120.26	at not having a self that fit,
122.26	and the confusion that came
124.26	from my self being rejected,
126.26	created anxiety, shame
129.26	and hopelessness,
131.26	which kind of defined me for a long time.
134.26	But in retrospect,
136.26	the destruction of my self was so repetitive
139.26	that I started to see a pattern.
141.26	The self changed,
144.26	got affected, broken, destroyed,
147.26	but another one would evolve --
150.26	sometimes stronger,
152.26	sometimes hateful,
154.26	sometimes not wanting to be there at all.
156.26	The self was not constant.
160.26	And how many times
162.26	would my self have to die
164.26	before I realized
166.26	that it was never alive in the first place?
169.26	I grew up on the coast of England
171.26	in the '70s.
173.26	My dad is white from Cornwall,
176.26	and my mom is black from Zimbabwe.
180.26	Even the idea of us as a family
182.26	was challenging to most people.
185.26	But nature had its wicked way,
187.26	and brown babies were born.
189.26	But from about the age of five,
191.26	I was aware that I didn't fit.
194.26	I was the black atheist kid
197.26	in the all-white Catholic school run by nuns.
200.26	I was an anomaly,
202.26	and my self was rooting around for definition
206.26	and trying to plug in.
209.26	Because the self likes to fit,
211.26	to see itself replicated,
213.26	to belong.
215.26	That confirms its existence
217.26	and its importance.
219.26	And it is important.
221.26	It has an extremely important function.
223.26	Without it, we literally can't interface with others.
227.26	We can't hatch plans
229.26	and climb that stairway of popularity,
232.26	of success.
234.26	But my skin color wasn't right.
237.26	My hair wasn't right.
239.26	My history wasn't right.
241.26	My self became defined
243.26	by otherness,
245.26	which meant that, in that social world,
247.26	I didn't really exist.
249.26	"And I was ""other"" before being anything else --"
252.26	even before being a girl.
255.26	I was a noticeable nobody.
258.26	Another world was opening up
261.26	around this time:
263.26	performance and dancing.
266.26	That nagging dread of self-hood
269.26	didn't exist when I was dancing.
272.26	I'd literally lose myself.
275.26	And I was a really good dancer.
278.26	I would put
280.26	all my emotional expression
282.26	into my dancing.
284.26	I could be in the movement
287.26	in a way that I wasn't able to be
289.26	in my real life, in myself.
292.26	And at 16,
294.26	I stumbled across another opportunity,
297.26	and I earned my first acting role in a film.
301.26	I can hardly find the words
303.26	to describe the peace I felt
306.26	when I was acting.
308.26	My dysfunctional self
310.26	could actually plug in
312.26	to another self, not my own,
314.26	and it felt so good.
317.26	It was the first time that I existed
319.26	inside a fully-functioning self --
322.26	one that I controlled,
325.26	that I steered,
327.26	that I gave life to.
330.26	But the shooting day would end,
332.26	and I'd return
334.26	to my gnarly, awkward self.
337.26	By 19,
340.26	I was a fully-fledged movie actor,
342.26	but still searching for definition.
345.26	I applied to read anthropology
347.26	at university.
349.26	Dr. Phyllis Lee gave me my interview,
352.26	"and she asked me, ""How would you define race?"""
356.26	Well, I thought I had the answer to that one,
358.26	"and I said, ""Skin color."""
361.26	"""So biology, genetics?"" she said."
365.26	"""Because, Thandie, that's not accurate."
367.26	Because there's actually more genetic difference
370.26	between a black Kenyan
372.26	and a black Ugandan
374.26	than there is between a black Kenyan
377.26	and, say, a white Norwegian.
379.26	Because we all stem from Africa.
381.26	So in Africa,
383.26	there's been more time
385.26	"to create genetic diversity."""
387.26	In other words,
389.26	race has no basis
391.26	in biological or scientific fact.
394.26	On the one hand, result.
397.26	Right?
399.26	On the other hand, my definition of self
402.26	just lost a huge chunk of its credibility.
405.26	But what was credible,
407.26	what is biological and scientific fact,
410.26	is that we all stem from Africa --
413.26	in fact, from a woman called Mitochondrial Eve
416.26	who lived 160,000 years ago.
419.26	And race is an illegitimate concept
422.26	which our selves have created
424.26	based on fear and ignorance.
428.26	Strangely, these revelations
430.26	didn't cure my low self-esteem,
433.26	that feeling of otherness.
436.26	My desire to disappear
438.26	was still very powerful.
440.26	I had a degree from Cambridge;
442.26	I had a thriving career,
444.26	but my self was a car crash,
447.26	and I wound up with bulimia
449.26	and on a therapist's couch.
451.26	And of course I did.
453.26	I still believed
455.26	my self was all I was.
457.26	I still valued self-worth
459.26	above all other worth,
461.26	and what was there to suggest otherwise?
464.26	We've created entire value systems
466.26	and a physical reality
468.26	to support the worth of self.
470.26	Look at the industry for self-image
472.26	and the jobs it creates,
474.26	the revenue it turns over.
477.26	We'd be right in assuming
479.26	that the self is an actual living thing.
481.26	But it's not. It's a projection
484.26	which our clever brains create
486.26	in order to cheat ourselves
488.26	from the reality of death.
492.26	But there is something
494.26	that can give the self
496.26	ultimate and infinite connection --
499.26	and that thing is oneness,
501.26	our essence.
503.26	The self's struggle
505.26	for authenticity and definition
507.26	will never end
509.26	unless it's connected to its creator --
511.26	to you and to me.
514.26	And that can happen with awareness --
517.26	awareness of the reality of oneness
520.26	and the projection of self-hood.
523.26	For a start, we can think about
525.26	all the times when we do lose ourselves.
528.26	It happens when I dance,
530.26	when I'm acting.
532.26	I'm earthed in my essence,
534.26	and my self is suspended.
537.26	In those moments,
539.26	I'm connected to everything --
541.26	the ground, the air,
544.26	the sounds, the energy from the audience.
546.26	All my senses are alert and alive
550.26	in much the same way as an infant might feel --
553.26	that feeling of oneness.
556.26	And when I'm acting a role,
559.26	I inhabit another self,
561.26	and I give it life for awhile,
563.26	because when the self is suspended
566.26	so is divisiveness
568.26	and judgment.
570.26	And I've played everything
572.26	from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery
574.26	to Secretary of State in 2004.
578.26	And no matter how other
580.26	these selves might be,
582.26	they're all related in me.
586.26	And I honestly believe
588.26	the key to my success as an actor
590.26	and my progress as a person
592.26	has been the very lack of self
595.26	that used to make me feel
597.26	so anxious and insecure.
599.26	I always wondered
601.26	why I could feel others' pain so deeply,
605.26	why I could recognize
607.26	the somebody in the nobody.
610.26	It's because I didn't have a self to get in the way.
614.26	I thought I lacked substance,
617.26	and the fact that I could feel others'
619.26	meant that I had nothing of myself to feel.
622.26	The thing that was a source of shame
625.26	was actually a source of enlightenment.
628.26	And when I realized
630.26	and really understood
632.26	that my self is a projection and that it has a function,
635.26	a funny thing happened.
637.26	I stopped giving it so much authority.
639.26	I give it its due.
641.26	I take it to therapy.
643.26	I've become very familiar
645.26	with its dysfunctional behavior.
647.26	But I'm not ashamed of my self.
650.26	In fact, I respect my self
652.26	and its function.
654.26	And over time and with practice,
657.26	I've tried to live
659.26	more and more from my essence.
661.26	And if you can do that,
664.26	incredible things happen.
666.26	I was in Congo in February,
669.26	dancing and celebrating
671.26	with women who've survived
673.26	the destruction of their selves
675.26	in literally unthinkable ways --
678.26	destroyed because other brutalized, psychopathic selves
681.26	all over that beautiful land
684.26	are fueling our selves' addiction
687.26	to iPods, Pads, and bling,
690.26	which further disconnect ourselves
692.26	from ever feeling their pain,
694.26	their suffering,
696.26	their death.
698.26	Because, hey,
700.26	if we're all living in ourselves
702.26	and mistaking it for life,
704.26	then we're devaluing
706.26	and desensitizing life.
708.26	And in that disconnected state,
710.26	yeah, we can build factory farms with no windows,
714.26	destroy marine life
716.26	and use rape as a weapon of war.
720.26	So here's a note to self:
723.26	The cracks have started to show
725.26	in our constructed world,
728.26	and oceans will continue
730.26	to surge through the cracks,
732.26	and oil and blood,
735.26	rivers of it.
738.26	Crucially, we haven't been figuring out
740.26	how to live in oneness
742.26	with the Earth and every other living thing.
745.26	We've just been insanely trying to figure out
748.26	how to live with each other -- billions of each other.
751.26	Only we're not living with each other;
753.26	our crazy selves are living with each other
756.26	and perpetuating an epidemic
758.26	of disconnection.
761.26	Let's live with each other
764.26	and take it a breath at a time.
767.26	If we can get under that heavy self,
771.26	light a torch of awareness,
773.26	and find our essence,
775.26	our connection to the infinite
777.26	and every other living thing.
780.26	We knew it from the day we were born.
782.26	Let's not be freaked out
784.26	by our bountiful nothingness.
787.26	It's more a reality
789.26	than the ones our selves have created.
791.26	Imagine what kind of existence we can have
795.26	if we honor inevitable death of self,
799.26	appreciate the privilege of life
803.26	and marvel at what comes next.
807.26	Simple awareness is where it begins.
810.26	Thank you for listening.
812.26	(Applause)
