13.11	I want you to touch your face.
15.406	Go on.
17.406	What do you feel?
18.833	Soft? Squishy?
21.313	It's you, right? You're feeling you?
24.929	Well, it's not quite true.
27.207	You're actually feeling
27.207	thousands of microscopic creatures
30.476	that live on our face and fingers.
34.301	You're feeling some of the fungi
36.047	that drifted down
36.047	from the air ducts today.
38.951	They set off our allergies
40.942	and smell of mildew.
43.865	You're feeling some
43.865	of the 100 billion bacterial cells
48.033	that live on our skin.
50.273	They've been munching away
50.273	at your skin oils and replicating,
54.203	producing the smells of body odor.
57.384	You're likely even touching
57.384	the fecal bacteria
60.323	that sprayed onto you the last time
60.323	you flushed a toilet,
64.007	or those bacteria that live
64.007	in our water pipes
67.155	and sprayed onto you
67.155	with your last shower.
70.486	Sorry.
71.661	(Laughter)
73.153	You're probably even giving
73.153	a microscopic high five
76.741	to the two species of mites
76.741	that live on our faces,
80.49	on all of our faces.
82.697	They've spent the night
82.697	squirming across your face
85.367	and having sex on the bridge of your nose.
88.239	(Laughter)
91.79	Many of them are now leaking
91.79	their gut contents onto your pores.
95.976	(Laughter)
98.056	Now look at your finger.
100.186	How's it feel? Gross?
102.311	In desperate need of soap or bleach?
106.192	That's how you feel now,
107.83	but it's not going to be
107.83	how you feel in the future.
111.274	For the last 100 years,
113.223	we've had an adversarial relationship
115.224	with the microscopic life nearest us.
117.863	If I told you there was
117.863	a bug in your house
120.009	or bacteria in your sink,
121.267	there was a human-devised
121.267	solution for that,
123.618	a product to eradicate, exterminate,
126.778	disinfect.
128.663	We strive to remove most
128.663	of the microscopic life in our world now.
133.642	But in doing so, we're ignoring
133.642	the best source of new technology
138.359	on this planet.
140.444	The last 100 years have featured
140.444	human solutions to microbial problems,
146.114	but the next 100 years will feature
146.114	microbial solutions to human problems.
152.331	I'm a scientist, and I work
152.331	with researchers
154.724	at North Carolina State University
154.724	and the University of Colorado
158.024	to uncover the microscopic
158.024	life that is nearest us,
162.637	and that's often in our most intimate
162.637	and boring environments,
166.529	be it under our couches, in our backyards,
169.711	or in our belly buttons.
171.903	I do this work because it turns out
171.903	that we know very little
174.797	about the microscopic life
174.797	that's nearest us.
178.101	As of a few years ago,
178.101	no scientist could tell you
180.598	what bugs or microorganisms
180.598	live in your home --
184.328	your home, the place you know
184.328	better than anywhere else.
188.427	And so I and teams of others
190.191	are armed with Q-tips and tweezers
192.408	and advanced DNA techniques
194.298	to uncover the microscopic
194.298	life nearest us.
198.042	In doing so, we found
198.042	over 600 species of bugs
202.126	that live in USA homes,
204.05	everything from spiders and cockroaches
206.571	to tiny mites that cling to feathers.
209.91	And we found over 100,000 species
209.91	of bacteria and fungi
215.259	that live in our dust bunnies,
217.298	thousands more that live
217.298	on our clothes or in our showers.
222.146	We've gone further still,
223.714	and we looked at the microorganisms
225.454	that live inside the bodies
225.454	of each of those bugs in our home.
230.328	In each bug, for example, a wasp,
233.762	we see a microscopic jungle
233.762	unfold in a petri plate,
237.996	a world of hundreds of vibrant species.
241.297	Behold the biological cosmos!
245.351	So many of the species
245.351	you're looking at right now
247.804	don't yet have names.
249.723	Most of the life around us
249.723	remains unknown.
253.65	I remember the first time I discovered
253.65	and got to name a new species.
257.177	It was a fungus that lives
257.177	in the nest of a paper wasp.
260.695	It's white and fluffy,
262.944	"and I named it ""mucor nidicola,"""
265.512	meaning in Latin that it lives
265.512	in the nest of another.
269.772	This is a picture of it
269.772	growing on a dinosaur,
272.64	because everyone
272.64	thinks dinosaurs are cool.
276.506	At the time, I was in graduate school,
278.846	and I was so excited
278.846	that I had found this new life form.
282.592	I called up my dad, and I go,
284.392	"""Dad! I just discovered"
284.392	"a new microorganism species."""
288.394	And he laughed and he goes,
289.919	"""That's great. I hope you also"
289.919	"discovered a cure for it."""
293.211	(Laughter)
294.681	"""Cure it."""
297.022	Now, my dad is my biggest fan,
299.753	so in that crushing moment where he wanted
299.753	to kill my new little life form,
304.147	I realized that actually I had failed him,
306.717	both as a daughter and a scientist.
308.902	In my years toiling away in labs
308.902	and in people's backyards,
312.852	investigating and cataloging
312.852	the microscopic life around us,
316.556	I'd never made clear
316.556	my true mission to him.
320.264	My goal is not to find technology
322.204	to kill the new microscopic
322.204	life around us.
325.135	My goal is to find new technology
325.135	from this life, that will help save us.
331.315	The diversity of life in our homes is more
331.315	than a list of 100,000 new species.
337.091	It is 100,000 new sources
337.091	of solutions to human problems.
342.268	I know it's hard to believe
342.268	that anything that's so small
344.993	or only has one cell
346.175	can do anything powerful,
347.518	but they can.
348.879	These creatures
348.879	are microscopic alchemists,
351.748	with the ability to transform
351.748	their environment
354.63	with an arsenal of chemical tools.
357.745	This means that they can live
357.745	anywhere on this planet,
360.752	and they can eat whatever
360.752	food is around them.
364.372	This means they can eat everything
364.372	from toxic waste to plastic,
369.895	and they can produce waste products
369.895	like oil and battery power
374.434	and even tiny nuggets of real gold.
378.549	They can transform the inedible
378.549	into nutritive.
382.567	They can make sugar into alcohol.
385.746	They give chocolate its flavor,
387.683	and soil the power to grow.
390.273	I'm here to tell you
391.464	that the next 100 years will feature
391.464	these microscopic creatures
394.635	solving more of our problems.
396.78	And we have a lot of problems
396.78	to choose from.
399.582	We've got the mundane:
399.582	bad-smelling clothes or bland food.
404.284	And we've got the monumental:
406.345	disease, pollution, war.
411.146	And so this is my mission:
412.854	to not just catalog
412.854	the microscopic life around us,
416.108	but to find out what it's uniquely
416.108	well-suited to help us with.
420.501	Here's an example.
421.89	We started with a pest,
423.546	a wasp that lives on many of our homes.
426.527	Inside that wasp, we plucked out
426.527	a little-known microorganism species
431.478	with a unique ability:
433.595	it could make beer.
435.706	This is a trait that only
435.706	a few species on this planet have.
439.255	In fact, all commercially produced
439.255	beer you've ever had
442.14	likely came from one of only
442.14	three microorganism species.
446.549	Yet our species, it could make
446.549	a beer that tasted like honey,
451.416	and it could also make
451.416	a delightfully tart beer.
454.863	In fact, this microorganism species
454.863	that lives in the belly of a wasp,
459.427	it could make a valuable sour beer
461.748	better than any other species
461.748	on this planet.
466.496	There are now four species
466.496	that produce commercial beer.
471.017	Where you used to see a pest,
473.356	now think of tasting
473.356	your future favorite beer.
477.745	As a second example,
479.298	I worked with researchers
479.298	to dig in the dirt in people's backyards.
483.313	There, we uncovered a microorganism
483.313	that could make novel antibiotics,
487.394	antibiotics that can kill
487.394	the world's worst superbugs.
491.51	This was an awesome thing to find,
494.743	but here's the secret:
496.984	for the last 60 years,
498.928	most of the antibiotics on the market
501.241	have come from similar soil bacteria.
504.089	Every day, you and I
504.089	and everyone in this room
507.138	and on this planet,
508.904	are saved by similar soil bacteria
508.904	that produce most of our antibiotics.
515.045	Where you used to see dirt,
516.742	now think of medication.
520.222	Perhaps my favorite example
520.222	comes from colleagues
522.892	who are studying
522.892	a pond scum microorganism,
525.812	which is tragically named after
525.812	the cow dung it was first found in.
530.208	It's pretty unremarkable
530.208	and would be unworthy of discussion,
534.19	except that the researchers found
534.19	that if you feed it to mice,
537.736	it vaccinates against PTSD.
541.662	It vaccinates against fear.
545.238	Where you used to see pond scum,
545.238	now think of hope.
549.897	There are so many more microbial examples
552.325	that I don't have time
552.325	to talk about today.
554.942	I gave you examples of solutions
554.942	that came from just three species,
560.35	but imagine what those other
564.72	might be able to do.
566.571	In the future, they might be able
566.571	to make you sexier
570.578	or smarter
572.855	or perhaps live longer.
576.303	So I want you to look
576.303	at your finger again.
579.005	Think about all those
579.005	microscopic creatures
581.315	that are unknown.
582.786	Think about in the future
582.786	what they might be able to do
585.815	or make
587.528	or whose life they might be able to save.
590.891	How does your finger feel right now?
593.322	A little bit powerful?
596.384	That's because you're feeling the future.
599.03	Thank you.
600.623	(Applause)
