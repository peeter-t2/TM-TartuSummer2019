12.457	Throughout the history of computers
15.581	we've been striving
15.581	to shorten the gap between us
18.828	and digital information,
20.422	the gap between our physical world
22.256	and the world in the screen
24.054	where our imagination can go wild.
26.896	And this gap has become shorter,
30.823	shorter, and even shorter,
33.588	and now this gap is shortened down
35.232	to less than a millimeter,
36.542	the thickness of a touch-screen glass,
38.42	and the power of computing
39.87	has become accessible to everyone.
44.773	But I wondered, what if there
44.773	could be no boundary at all?
49.812	I started to imagine
49.812	what this would look like.
53.556	First, I created this tool
56.007	which penetrates into the digital space,
58.516	so when you press it hard on the screen,
60.607	it transfers its physical
60.607	body into pixels.
63.94	Designers can materialize their ideas
66.052	directly in 3D,
67.748	and surgeons can practice
67.748	on virtual organs
70.3	underneath the screen.
72.524	So with this tool, this
72.524	boundary has been broken.
77.421	But our two hands still
77.421	remain outside the screen.
80.388	How can you reach inside and interact
82.872	with the digital information
84.299	using the full dexterity of our hands?
87.303	At Microsoft Applied Sciences,
89.605	along with my mentor Cati Boulanger,
91.521	I redesigned the computer
92.792	and turned a little space
92.792	above the keyboard
95.673	into a digital workspace.
98.038	By combining a transparent
98.038	display and depth cameras
100.539	for sensing your fingers and face,
102.189	now you can lift up your hands
102.189	from the keyboard
104.499	and reach inside this 3D space
107.337	and grab pixels with your bare hands.
109.837	(Applause)
112.808	Because windows and files have
112.808	a position in the real space,
117.014	selecting them is as easy
117.014	as grabbing a book off your shelf.
120.373	Then you can flip through this book
122.526	while highlighting the lines, words
124.243	on the virtual touch pad
124.243	below each floating window.
126.807	Architects can stretch
126.807	or rotate the models
129.342	with their two hands directly.
131.767	So in these examples,
133.387	we are reaching into the digital world.
136.124	But how about reversing its role
138.47	and having the digital
138.47	information reach us instead?
143.289	I'm sure many of us
143.289	have had the experience
145.361	of buying and returning items online.
147.468	But now you don't have to worry about it.
149.445	What I got here is an online
149.445	augmented fitting room.
154.083	This is a view that you get from
155.985	head-mounted or see-through display
157.729	when the system understands
157.729	the geometry of your body.
162.876	Taking this idea further,
162.876	I started to think,
166.427	instead of just seeing
166.427	these pixels in our space,
169.796	how can we make it physical
171.318	so that we can touch and feel it?
175.58	What would such a future look like?
178.629	At MIT Media Lab,
178.629	along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii
182.287	and my collaborator Rehmi Post,
184.31	we created this one physical pixel.
187.954	Well, in this case, this spherical magnet
190.578	acts like a 3D pixel in our space,
192.93	which means that both computers and people
195.834	can move this object to anywhere
197.732	within this little 3D space.
199.701	What we did was essentially
199.701	canceling gravity
203.193	and controlling the movement by combining
205.332	magnetic levitation
205.332	and mechanical actuation
208.156	and sensing technologies.
210.633	And by digitally programming the object,
213.138	we are liberating
213.138	the object from constraints
215.915	of time and space, which means that now,
219.35	human motions can be
219.35	recorded and played back
223.246	and left permanently
223.246	in the physical world.
226.865	So choreography can be taught
226.865	physically over distance
229.898	and Michael Jordan's famous
229.898	shooting can be replicated
232.494	over and over as a physical reality.
235.972	Students can use this as a tool
238.152	to learn about the complex concepts
240.094	such as planetary motion, physics,
244.178	and unlike computer screens or textbooks,
246.997	this is a real, tangible experience
249.479	that you can touch and feel,
249.479	and it's very powerful.
253.137	And what's more exciting
255.119	than just turning what's currently
255.119	in the computer physical
258.467	is to start imagining
258.467	how programming the world
261.656	will alter even our daily
261.656	physical activities.
267.46	(Laughter)
269.942	As you can see, the digital information
272.699	will not just show us something
274.217	but it will start directly acting upon us
276.327	as a part of our physical surroundings
278.626	without disconnecting
278.626	ourselves from our world.
282.824	Today, we started by talking
282.824	about the boundary,
287.17	but if we remove this boundary,
289.85	the only boundary left is our imagination.
293.738	Thank you.
294.986	(Applause)
