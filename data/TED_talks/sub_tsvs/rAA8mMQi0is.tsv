16.26	"The moment I say ""school,"""
18.26	so many memories come back to me.
22.26	It's like after every exam,
22.26	when I walk out,
25.26	"the teacher would say, ""Hey, come."
27.26	"How did you do?"""
29.26	I would say with a great smile,
29.26	"""I will definitely pass."""
31.26	And I didn't understand why,
33.26	"in one hand they say, ""Speak the truth,"""
35.26	in the other hand, when you say
35.26	the truth, they hated you.
38.046	So it went on like that,
39.26	and I didn't know where
39.26	else to find myself.
42.26	So I remember those nights
44.26	I used to go to sleep
46.26	with asking help from [the] Unknown
49.26	because, for some reason,
51.26	I couldn't believe
51.26	what my father and mother
53.38	hanged in the Puja room as a god,
56.26	because my friend's family
58.26	had something else as a god.
60.26	"So I thought, ""I guess"
60.26	I'll pray to [the] Unknown
62.618	"and ask help,"""
65.26	and started getting help from everywhere,
67.26	each and every corner
67.26	of my life at that time.
71.26	My brothers started giving me
71.26	a few tips about drawing and painting.
74.523	Then, when I was in eighth standard
77.26	around 13 years old,
80.26	I started working in a part-time job
82.26	in one of the signboard
82.26	artists called Putu.
88.212	And then school also
88.212	started supporting me.
90.26	"""Oh, he's bad at studies,"
92.26	but let him send
92.26	"to the drawing competitions."""
95.26	So it was good to survive
95.26	with that little tool
98.26	that I found to find
98.26	my own place in school.
102.26	And one of those competitions,
104.26	I just won a small,
104.26	little transistor Philips radio.
107.26	And I didn't have the patience to wait
109.26	until I reached home.
111.26	So I just switched
111.26	on in the train, loudly.
113.332	If you travel in Indian trains,
115.26	you can see people listening to radio
117.26	and, you know, even from their mobiles.
119.26	So at that time -- and I was 13 --
121.26	and I was listening to just radio,
124.26	and someone happened to sit next to me,
126.26	like these three people are sitting here.
128.26	You know, like just adjacent to me.
130.26	"He just started asking, ""Where did"
130.26	"you buy the radio? How much is it?"""
133.618	"I said, ""It's a prize"
133.618	"from [an] art competition."""
136.26	"And he said, ""Oh, I teach"
136.26	at a college of arts.
139.26	I think
141.26	you should study in a school of art.
143.26	"You just quit school and come there."""
145.26	So, why I'm telling you this,
147.26	you know, maybe, you know,
149.26	whoever is sitting next to you can
149.26	change your whole life -- it's possible.
152.856	It is that we need we need
152.856	to be open and fine-tuned.
156.26	So that's what made me enter
159.26	[the] college of arts after three attempts
162.26	and just continue to inquire
165.26	what I really want to do
165.26	with art work, or art
168.26	and finally I'm here in front of you.
170.26	When I look back, you know,
172.26	on what happened between that time
174.26	and now here --
177.26	the last 10/15 years --
179.26	I can see that most of the works
181.26	revolve around three subjects,
184.26	but it was not intentional.
186.26	And I just start out with a trace
186.26	because I was thinking,
188.26	"""What really makes us?"" -- you know,"
190.26	it's actually [the] past,
190.26	what makes a person.
194.26	So I was thinking,
196.26	but when you look at the past,
198.26	the way to understand the past
200.26	is only by the traces available,
202.26	because we cannot go back [to] the past.
204.26	It can be ruins, or it can be music,
206.26	or it can be painting or drawing
206.26	or writing, whatever it is.
209.26	But it is just a kind
209.26	of trace of that time.
214.26	And that fascinated me,
216.26	to explore that territory.
220.26	So I was working on the line,
223.26	but instead of working about traces,
227.26	I started capturing traces.
230.26	So here are some of the works
230.26	I would like to show you.
233.26	"So this is called ""Self In Progress."""
236.26	It's just a trace of being in this body.
239.26	So here, what happened then,
241.26	you know -- what I really enjoyed the most
243.26	is that this sculpture
245.26	is nothing but a trace of myself.
249.26	It's almost like a 3D photograph.
251.26	So there is an element of performance,
253.26	and there is an element of sculpture,
255.26	and there is an element of feeling
255.26	one's self, so close to one's self.
258.618	So it's almost like fossils
258.618	for the future.
261.26	And then moved slowly
263.26	to explore the other possibilities
263.26	of capturing traces.
269.26	So this is what I was talking
269.26	about, while molding,
272.26	it's such a great experience,
274.26	because we have freedom of like walking,
276.26	or moving my hand or,
276.26	moving around in the space,
279.26	but the moment this becomes solid,
282.26	when you cannot move even an inch,
285.26	because this is plaster of Paris, so
285.26	the moment you pour it it's like liquid;
288.951	but after 20 minutes,
288.951	it's almost like a hard stone.
292.26	So this is capturing
292.26	the trace of a thumbprint
296.26	because, knowingly or unknowingly,
298.26	whatever we do, you know,
298.26	we leave our traces here.
301.26	"So I just thought, ""I'm going to capture"
304.26	thumbprint, footprint,
306.26	"or whatever traces we leave as humans."""
309.26	This is the trace of fire,
312.26	this is the trace of sun.
315.26	Because when I was capturing
315.26	traces, you know,
317.475	this thought comes to me always:
320.26	is it, only when the object touches
320.26	the thing and it leaves the trace,
323.26	"or is there other ways to capture it?"""
325.26	So this work is nothing but like --
327.26	because of the focal length of the lens,
329.26	it just shows what is on the other side.
333.26	So I just put the paper
333.26	on the focal length,
335.38	which was an etching print,
337.26	then I got the portrait
337.26	of [the] sun from sunlight.
341.26	"This is called ""Dawn to Dawn."""
343.26	What I did here, I just put
343.26	like 10 feet [of] paper
346.26	then put a coconut rope,
348.26	and just burnt it.
350.26	So it took about 24
350.26	hours to get this line.
352.308	So wherever the fire is eating the paper,
354.308	that's what becomes the work --
356.26	detail.
362.26	Even though we have traces
364.26	when we try to understand them,
368.26	the perception and context
370.26	play a major role to understand it.
372.26	So do we really understand what it is,
375.26	or are we trying to get
377.26	what we think it is?
379.26	Then move towards questioning
379.26	the perception
381.38	because, even though there are traces,
383.26	when you try to understand them,
383.26	you know you play a major role.
386.332	So like let's say even a simple act.
388.26	How many of you saw
388.26	a cow crossing in India
391.26	while you were coming
391.26	from Bangalore to Mysore?
393.523	Can you just raise the hand?
396.26	If you just ask an opinion
398.26	of how, everyone can interpret it.
401.26	Like, let's say, if a schoolteacher says,
403.26	"she'll simply say, ""To"
403.26	"get to the other side."""
405.475	Why the cow was crossing
405.475	the road, you know.
408.26	The answer can be so
408.26	different if Potter said it.
411.26	"He would say, ""For the greater good."""
414.26	Martin Luther King would say,
416.26	"""I imagine a world where"
416.26	all cows will be free
419.26	to cross the road,
421.26	without having their motives
421.26	"called into question."""
424.26	(Laughter)
426.26	Imagine Moses comes now, and he sees
428.26	the same cow walking around the street.
430.26	He would definitely say,
432.26	"""God came down from heaven,"
435.26	and he said unto the cow,
438.26	'Thou shalt cross the road.'
441.26	And cow crossed the road,
443.26	and there was much
443.26	"rejoicing as a holy cow."""
446.26	(Laughter)
448.26	Freud would say,
450.26	"""The fact that you're at all concerned"
452.26	reveals your underlying
452.26	"sexual insecurity."""
455.26	(Laughter)
457.26	If we ask Einstein,
459.26	"he would say, ""Whether"
459.26	the cow crossed the road,
462.26	or the road moved underneath the cow,
464.26	"depends on your frame of reference."""
466.26	(Laughter)
468.26	Or Buddha --
470.26	if he saw the same cow, he would say,
472.26	"""Asking this question denies"
472.26	"your own nature [as a] cow."""
475.26	(Laughter)
478.26	So, what we see
481.26	is just what we think often,
484.26	and most of the time,
484.26	we don't see what it is.
487.26	It just all depends on one's perception.
490.26	And context, what is really context?
493.26	You know, I could just show you
493.26	this little piece of paper.
496.26	Because I always think meaning
496.26	doesn't really exist.
501.26	The meaning of what we create
501.26	in this world doesn't exist.
504.046	It's just created by the mind.
506.26	If you look at this piece of paper,
509.26	this is the breadth
511.26	and this is called length.
513.26	This is how we've been taught in school.
517.26	But if you tear it in the middle --
520.26	now, I didn't touch this breadth,
522.26	but still, the meaning of this changes.
524.26	So what we conceive as a meaning
526.26	is always not there;
528.26	it's on the other side,
530.26	even when we say dark, light,
532.26	good, bad, tall, short --
534.26	all meaning it doesn't exist in reality.
537.26	It's just that being a human,
539.26	the way we train to perceive the reality
542.26	creates this meaning.
544.26	So this work from this period
546.26	is mostly like --
548.26	you know, this is a work
548.26	"called ""Light Makes Dark."""
550.713	It's just captured through from the lamp.
553.26	So the lamp is not just giving
553.26	a light, it's also giving a darkness.
556.523	So this is a work of art,
556.523	which is just trying to explore that.
560.26	"This is called ""Limit Out."""
562.26	This shows how limited our eye
562.26	or hearing sense or touch --
565.26	do we really see?
567.26	This is an exact negative.
569.26	It's about six inches deep in the wall,
571.26	but it just appears
571.26	like it's coming out of the wall.
577.26	You know the wall is almost like --
579.26	this is the first skin,
579.26	and this is the second,
581.499	and there's a third,
581.499	and each creates a meaning.
583.809	And we're just pulling
583.809	the wall off the gallery.
586.26	"Again, ""Inward Out."""
588.26	It's a full-figure cast from myself.
590.26	It's about eight inches deep.
596.26	When I was doing that, I always wondered
596.26	since I've worked with creators --
599.26	and now you know, I've moved
599.26	to questioning the perception --
602.26	whenever I see the bird flying in the sky,
605.26	it just makes me feel like:
608.26	is there anything behind,
608.26	are there any traces up there,
611.26	which as a human, we don't see them?
614.26	Is there any way to capture the thought
617.26	into visual art?
620.26	I couldn't find it.
623.26	But a solution arrived
626.26	after being quiet and not working
626.26	for about six, seven months,
629.26	in the restroom,
631.26	when I was changing the air freshener
634.26	that goes from solid substance to vapor.
636.26	It's called Odonil.
638.26	This is the work I made
638.26	out of that material.
642.26	The process to get to make
642.26	the sculpture was interesting,
644.951	because I wrote to Balsara,
646.26	who produces that air
646.26	freshener called Odonil,
648.26	"saying, ""Dear Sir, I am an artist."
648.26	This is my catalogue.
650.26	"Will you help me to make this sculpture?"""
652.26	They never wrote back to me.
654.26	"Then I thought, ""I will go"
654.26	to the Small Scale Industries
657.26	"Facilitating Unit and ask help."""
659.26	"So I told them, ""I'd like to start"
659.26	"an air freshener company."""
663.26	"They said, ""Of course."
665.26	This is the fee for the project report,
667.26	and we will give you
667.26	"all the details,"" and they gave."
669.808	Finally, I went back to them and said,
672.26	"""It's not for starting the company,"
672.26	it's just to make my own work.
675.427	"Please come for the show."""
677.26	And they did.
679.26	And this work is in the Devi
679.26	Art Foundation in Delhi.
682.26	In India, nobody really
682.26	talks about works of art;
685.26	they always talk
685.26	about the appreciation of art.
688.26	You buy this for 3,000 rupees,
690.26	it'll become 30,000 in two months.
692.26	This is the craft that was going on,
694.26	but there are a few collectors
696.26	who also collect art which can depreciate.
698.26	And this was collected by Anupam --
700.26	which is like, finally in the end,
700.26	he will not have anything,
703.189	because it will evaporate.
706.26	So this is after a few weeks,
709.26	this is after a few months.
711.26	It's just all about questioning
711.26	the preconceptions.
714.26	"So if someone says, ""Oh,"
714.26	"I see the portrait,"""
717.26	it may not be the portrait
717.26	after a few months.
719.475	And if they say it's solid,
721.26	it will not be solid, it will evaporate.
724.26	And if they say they don't get it,
726.26	that's also not true,
728.26	because it's in the air.
730.26	It's in the same gallery
730.26	or in the same museum.
732.523	So they inhaled it,
734.26	but they are not aware of it.
737.26	While I was doing that work,
739.26	my mom and my dad,
741.26	they were looking at it and they said,
743.26	"""Why do you deal with negative"
743.26	"subjects all the time?"""
746.26	"And I was like, ""What do you mean?"""
748.26	"""Light makes dark and now"
748.26	evaporating self.
751.26	Don't you think it remained
751.26	"something about death,"" they said."
754.26	"""Of course not. For me,"" I'm thinking,"
756.26	"""this is tucked in some small solid,"
758.26	but the moment it evaporates,
760.26	"it's merged with the whole."""
762.26	"But she said, ""No. Still, I don't like it."
764.26	Can you make something from nothing
766.26	"as a sculptor?"""
768.26	"I said, ""No, mom. It can't be."
770.26	Because we can create
773.26	a sculpture
775.26	by gathering dust together,
777.26	or we can break the sculpture
777.26	and get the dust,
780.26	but there is nowhere that we can
780.26	"bring dust into the universe."""
783.26	So, I did this work for her.
786.26	"It's called ""Emerging Angel."""
788.26	This is the first day --
790.26	it just gives the appearance
792.26	that one is becoming the other.
794.26	So, the same sculpture
796.26	after a few days.
800.26	This is after 15/20 days.
803.26	Through that small little slit
805.26	between the glass box and the wood,
807.26	the air goes underneath the sculpture
807.26	and creates the other one.
810.332	This gave me a greater faith.
812.26	That evaporating sculpture
812.26	gave me a greater faith
815.26	that maybe there
815.26	is many more possibilities
817.332	to capture [the] invisible.
819.26	So what you see now
821.26	"is called ""Shadow Foreshadow."""
824.26	And what I'd like to tell you
826.26	is we don't see shadow,
826.26	and we don't see light too;
829.26	we see the source of the light.
831.26	We see where it's bouncing,
831.26	but we don't see [them] as they exist.
834.427	You know, that's why the night
834.427	sky, we see the sky as dark,
837.26	but it's filled with light all the time.
839.26	When it's bounced on the moon, we see it.
841.26	The same thing in the darkroom.
843.26	The little dust particle
843.26	will again, reflect the light,
846.26	and we realize the existence of light.
848.26	So we don't see dark, we don't see light,
851.26	we don't see gravity,
851.26	we don't see electricity.
854.26	So, I just started doing this work
857.26	to inquire further
860.26	about how to sculpt
862.26	the space between this object and there.
865.26	Because, as a visual artist, if I'm
865.26	seeing this and I'm seeing that --
868.618	but how to sculpt this, you know?
871.26	If we sculpt this, this
871.26	has two reference points.
874.26	The skin of this is also
874.26	representing this.
877.26	And skin at the other end
877.26	also represents the floor.
880.26	I did this as an experiment
883.26	of casting the shadow.
885.26	So this is a corrugated
885.26	box and its shadow.
888.26	Then the second one --
890.26	the moment you bring any invisible
890.26	into the visible world
893.26	it will have all the characteristics
893.26	of the visible existence.
896.26	So that produced a shadow.
898.26	Then I thought, okay, let me sculpt that.
900.26	Then, again, that becomes an object.
902.26	Again, throwing light, then the third one.
905.26	So what you see is nothing but shadow
907.26	of a shadow of a shadow.
909.26	And then again, at that point,
909.26	there is no shadow.
912.26	"I thought, ""Oh, good. Work is finished."""
916.26	You can see the detail.
922.26	"This is called ""Gravity."""
929.26	"It's called ""Breath."" It's just"
929.26	two holes on the gallery wall.
932.26	It's a false wall, which contains
934.26	like 110 cubic feet.
936.26	So that hole actually
938.26	makes the air come out and go in.
941.26	So where it's happening, we can see,
943.26	but what is happening
943.26	will remain invisible only.
945.594	This is from the show called
945.594	"""Invisible,"" at Talwar Gallery."
948.594	"This is called ""Kaayam."""
950.26	Detail.
955.26	And what I'd like to tell you,
958.26	our senses are so limited --
960.26	we cannot hear everything,
960.26	we cannot see everything.
962.26	"We don't feel, ""I am touching the air,"""
964.26	but if the breeze is a little more
964.26	faster, then I can feel it.
968.26	So all of our construction of reality
971.26	is through these limited senses.
973.26	So my request was like,
975.26	is there any way to use all this
977.26	as just a symbol or a sign?
981.26	And to really get to the point,
983.26	we should move beyond, you know,
985.26	go to the other side
985.26	of the wall, like illogic,
987.523	like are invisible.
989.26	Because when we see someone
989.26	walks, we see the footprint.
991.26	But if we're just cutting that footprint
991.26	from the whole thing and trying to analyze it,
994.26	you will miss the point
996.26	because the actual journey happens
996.26	between those footprints,
999.26	and the footprints are nothing
999.26	but passing time.
1001.57	Thank you.
1003.26	(Applause)
