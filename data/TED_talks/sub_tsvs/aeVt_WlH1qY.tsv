16.151	I'm going to talk about the power of a word:
19.365	jihad.
22.421	To the vast majority of practicing Muslims,
26.777	jihad is an internal struggle for the faith.
30.801	It is a struggle within, a struggle against vice, sin,
35.487	temptation, lust, greed.
37.777	It is a struggle to try and live a life
41.406	that is set by the moral codes written in the Koran.
48.104	In that original idea, the concept of jihad is as important
53.574	to Muslims as the idea of grace is to Christians.
59.432	It's a very powerful word, jihad, if you look at it in that respect,
63.178	and there's a certain almost mystical resonance to it.
68.16	And that's the reason why, for hundreds of years,
70.546	Muslims everywhere have named their children Jihad,
73.365	their daughters as much as their sons, in the same way
75.887	that, say, Christians name their daughters Grace,
79.709	and Hindus, my people, name our daughters Bhakti,
83.677	which means, in Sanskrit, spiritual worship.
89.149	But there have always been, in Islam, a small group,
91.914	a minority, who believe that jihad
94.383	is not only an internal struggle but also an external struggle
97.357	against forces that would threaten the faith, or the faithul.
103.733	And some of these people believe that in that struggle,
106.854	it is sometimes okay to take up arms.
110.453	And so the thousands of young Muslim men
113.16	who flocked to Afghanistan in the 1980s
116.077	to fight against the Soviet occupation of a Muslim country,
119.805	in their minds they were fighting a jihad,
122.533	they were doing jihad,
124.949	and they named themselves the Mujahideen,
127.741	which is a word that comes from the same root as jihad.
132.525	And we forget this now, but back then
135.365	the Mujahideen were celebrated in this country, in America.
139.323	We thought of them as holy warriors who were taking
141.821	the good fight to the ungodly communists.
145.577	America gave them weapons, gave them money,
147.622	gave them support, encouragement.
150.621	But within that group, a tiny, smaller group,
152.947	a minority within a minority within a minority,
156.829	were coming up with a new and dangerous
159.814	conception of jihad,
162.633	and in time this group would come to be led by Osama bin Laden,
167.942	and he refined the idea.
169.442	His idea of jihad was a global war of terror,
174.08	primarily targeted at the far enemy,
176.59	at the crusaders from the West, against America.
180.989	And the things he did in the pursuit of this jihad
183.828	were so horrendous, so monstrous,
186.508	and had such great impact,
188.483	that his definition was the one that stuck,
192.687	not just here in the West.
193.966	We didn't know any better. We didn't pause to ask.
197.825	We just assumed that if this insane man and his psychopathic followers
202.395	were calling what they did jihad, then that's what jihad must mean.
207.605	But it wasn't just us. Even in the Muslim world,
210.862	his definition of jihad began to gain acceptance.
215.533	A year ago I was in Tunis, and I met the imam
218.885	of a very small mosque, an old man.
220.825	Fifteen years ago, he named his granddaughter Jihad,
224.79	after the old meaning. He hoped that a name like that
227.757	would inspire her to live a spiritual life.
232.189	But he told me that after 9/11,
234.869	he began to have second thoughts.
237.549	He worried that if he called her by that name,
239.495	especially outdoors, outside in public,
242.02	he might be seen as endorsing bin Laden's idea of jihad.
247.938	On Fridays in his mosque, he gave sermons
250.401	trying to reclaim the meaning of the word,
254.818	but his congregants, the people who came to his mosque,
258.557	they had seen the videos. They had seen pictures
260.785	of the planes going into the towers, the towers coming down.
266.527	They had heard bin Laden say that that was jihad,
269.553	and claimed victory for it. And so the old imam worried
272.514	that his words were falling on deaf ears. No one was paying attention.
276.81	He was wrong. Some people were paying attention,
280.082	but for the wrong reasons.
281.988	The United States, at this point, was putting pressure
284.762	on all its Arab allies, including Tunisia,
287.201	to stamp out extremism in their societies,
291.538	and this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs
295.005	of the Tunisian intelligence service.
297.876	They had never paid him any attention before --
299.332	old man, small mosque --
302.557	but now they began to pay visits,
304.767	and sometimes they would drag him in for questions,
306.429	and always the same question:
307.777	"""Why did you name your granddaughter Jihad?"
311.988	Why do you keep using the word jihad in your Friday sermons?
316.587	Do you hate Americans?
318.652	"What is your connection to Osama bin Laden?"""
322.772	So to the Tunisian intelligence agency,
324.787	and organizations like it all over the Arab world,
327.62	jihad equaled extremism,
332.084	Bin Laden's definition had become institutionalized.
336.018	That was the power of that word that he was able to do.
339.807	And it filled this old imam, it filled him with great sadness.
345.529	He told me that, of bin Laden's many crimes, this was,
348.444	in his mind, one that didn't get enough attention,
351.516	that he took this word, this beautiful idea.
355.314	He didn't so much appropriate it as kidnapped it
359.78	and debased it and corrupted it
362.66	and turned it into something it was never meant to be,
366.02	and then persuaded all of us that it always was
371.697	a global jihad.
374.339	But the good news is
377.882	that the global jihad is almost over, as bin Laden defined it.
383.661	It was dying well before he did,
386.219	and now it's on its last legs.
388.528	Opinion polls from all over the Muslim world show
390.867	that there is very little interest among Muslims
395.419	in a global holy war against the West,
397.929	against the far enemy.
401.243	The supply of young men willing to fight and die for this cause is dwindling.
405.453	The supply of money — just as important, more important perhaps —
408.148	the supply of money to this activity is also dwindling.
410.811	The wealthy fanatics who were previously
413.619	sponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous.
420.235	What does that mean for us in the West?
421.668	Does it mean we can break out the champagne,
425.387	wash our hands of it, disengage, sleep easy at night?
430.615	No. Disengagement is not an option,
435.699	because if you let local jihad survive,
442.195	it becomes international jihad.
444.979	And so there's now a lot of different
447.66	violent jihads all over the world.
450.196	In Somalia, in Mali, in Nigeria,
452.483	in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, there are groups that claim
457.634	to be the inheritors of the legacy of Osama bin Laden.
463.032	They use his rhetoric.
464.548	They even use the brand name he created for his jihad.
469.715	So there is now an al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb,
473.873	there's an al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,
475.502	there is an al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.
478.152	There are other groups -- in Nigeria, Boko Haram,
480.239	in Somalia, al Shabaab -- and they all pay homage to Osama bin Laden.
486.352	But if you look closely,
488.286	they're not fighting a global jihad.
491.087	They're fighting battles over much narrower issues.
495.173	Usually it has to do with ethnicity or race or sectarianism,
499.542	or it's a power struggle.
500.734	More often than not, it's a power struggle
502.574	in one country, or even a small region within one country.
506.17	Occasionally they will go across a border,
509.134	from Iraq to Syria, from Mali to Algeria,
515.413	from Somalia to Kenya, but they're not fighting
517.293	a global jihad against some far enemy.
522.334	But that doesn't mean
525.421	that we can relax.
527.748	I was in Yemen recently, where -- it's the home
529.999	of the last al Qaeda franchise
533.31	that still aspires to attack America, attack the West.
537.422	It's old school al Qaeda.
539.645	You may remember these guys.
540.832	They are the ones who tried to send the underwear bomber here,
543.513	and they were using the Internet to try and instigate
546.462	violence among American Muslims.
549.302	But they have been distracted recently.
550.642	Last year, they took control over a portion of southern Yemen,
553.349	and ran it, Taliban-style.
556.106	And then the Yemeni military got its act together,
558.905	and ordinary people rose up against these guys
562.222	and drove them out, and since then, most of their activities,
565.508	most of their attacks have been directed at Yemenis.
569.709	So I think we've come to a point now where we can say
573.75	that, just like all politics, all jihad is local.
577.246	But that's still not reason for us to disengage,
581.718	because we've seen that movie before, in Afghanistan.
585.463	When those Mujahideen defeated the Soviet Union,
589.262	we disengaged.
591.958	And even before the fizz had gone out of our celebratory champagne,
599.047	the Taliban had taken over in Kabul,
601.827	"and we said, ""Local jihad, not our problem."""
605.741	And then the Taliban gave the keys of Kandahar
608.467	to Osama bin Laden. He made it our problem.
611.003	Local jihad, if you ignore it, becomes global jihad again.
617.284	The good news is that it doesn't have to be.
620.891	We know how to fight it now.
623.064	We have the tools. We have the knowhow,
625.835	and we can take the lessons we've learned
627.422	from the fight against global jihad, the victory against global jihad,
631.323	and apply those to local jihad.
634.803	What are those lessons? We know who killed bin Laden:
639.595	SEAL Team Six.
641.53	Do we know, do we understand, who killed bin Ladenism?
645.992	Who ended the global jihad?
649.355	There lie the answers to the solution to local jihad.
652.726	Who killed bin Ladenism? Let's start with bin Laden himself.
657.004	He probably thought 9/11 was his greatest achievement.
659.395	In reality, it was the beginning of the end for him.
663.547	He killed 3,000 innocent people, and that filled
666.419	the Muslim world with horror and revulsion,
670.603	and what that meant was that his idea of jihad
673.796	could never become mainstream.
675.375	He condemned himself to operating on the lunatic fringes
679.254	of his own community.
683.315	9/11 didn't empower him; it doomed him.
688.423	Who killed bin Ladenism? Abu Musab al-Zarqawi killed it.
693.241	He was the especially sadistic head of al Qaeda in Iraq
696.434	who sent hundreds of suicide bombers to attack
699.755	not Americans but Iraqis. Muslims. Sunni as well as Shiites.
706.227	Any claim that al Qaeda had to being protectors of Islam
710.195	against the Western crusaders
713.038	was drowned in the blood of Iraqi Muslims.
718.712	Who killed Osama bin Laden? The SEAL Team Six.
722.115	Who killed bin Ladenism? Al Jazeera did,
724.823	Al Jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations in Arabic,
729.883	because they circumvented the old, state-owned
732.9	television stations in a lot of these countries
736.395	which were designed to keep information from people.
739.387	Al Jazeera brought information to them, showed them
742.835	what was being said and done in the name of their religion,
746.232	exposed the hypocrisy of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda,
751.505	and allowed them, gave them the information
753.411	that allowed them to come to their own conclusions.
757.904	Who killed bin Ladenism? The Arab Spring did,
761.24	because it showed a way for young Muslims
764.704	to bring about change
768.552	in a manner that Osama bin Laden, with his
770.337	limited imagination, could never have conceived.
774	Who defeated the global jihad? The American military did,
777.398	the American soldiers did, with their allies,
779.88	fighting in faraway battlefields.
784.896	And perhaps, a time will come when they get the rightful credit for it.
790.072	So all these factors, and many more besides,
793.129	we don't even fully understand some of them yet,
796.296	these came together
799.129	to defeat a monstrosity as big as bin Ladenism,
802.92	the global jihad, you needed this group effort.
806.768	Now, not all of these things will work in local jihad.
808.848	The American military is not going to march into Nigeria
811.77	to take on Boko Haram,
814.379	and it's unlikely that SEAL Team Six will rappel
816.316	into the homes of al Shabaab's leaders and take them out.
820.85	But many of these other factors that were in play
824.404	are now even stronger than before. Half the work is already done.
830.278	We don't have to reinvent the wheel.
833.299	The notion of violent jihad in which more Muslims are killed
836.77	than any other kind of people is already thoroughly discredited.
840.346	We don't have to go back to that.
843.962	Satellite television and the Internet are informing
847.996	and empowering young Muslims in exciting new ways.
852.383	And the Arab Spring has produced governments,
855.008	many of them Islamist governments,
858.112	who know that, for their own self-preservation,
861.077	they need to take on the extremists in their midsts.
866.987	We don't need to persuade them, but we do need to help them,
869.842	because they haven't really come to this place before.
875.088	The good news, again, is that a lot of the things they need
878.842	we already have, and we are very good at giving:
881.641	economic assistance, not just money, but expertise,
885.564	technology, knowhow,
888.201	private investment, fair terms of trade,
892.239	medicine, education, technical support for training
896.449	for their police forces to become more effective,
899.54	for their anti-terror forces to become more efficient.
904.407	We've got plenty of these things.
905.821	Some of the other things that they need
908.114	we're not very good at giving. Maybe nobody is.
911.569	Time, patience, subtlety, understanding --
916.766	these are harder to give.
918.808	I live in New York now. Just this week,
921.185	posters have gone up in subway stations in New York
923.723	that describe jihad as savage.
929.449	But in all the many years that I have covered the Middle East,
933.802	I have never been as optimistic as I am today
937.034	that the gap between the Muslim world and the West
940.697	is narrowing fast,
943.321	and one of the many reasons for my optimism
944.994	is that, because I know there are millions,
948.306	hundreds of millions of people, Muslims like that old imam
952.129	in Tunis, who are reclaiming this word
958.871	and restoring to its original, beautiful purpose.
964.219	Bin Laden is dead. Bin Ladenism has been defeated.
966.835	His definition of jihad can now be expunged.
971.216	"To that jihad we can say, ""Goodbye. Good riddance."""
975.757	"To the real jihad we can say, ""Welcome back. Good luck."""
982.291	Thank you. (Applause)
