12.876	We're going to share
12.876	a lot of secrets today, you and I,
15.835	and in doing so, I hope that we can lift
18.315	some of the shame
18.315	many of us feel about sex.
22.915	How many here have ever been
22.915	catcalled by a stranger?
28.075	Lots of women.
30.521	For me, the time I remember best
33.202	is when that stranger
33.202	was a student of mine.
37.595	He came up to me after class that night
40.555	and his words confirmed
40.555	what I already knew:
43.435	"""I am so sorry, professor."
45.235	If I had known it was you,
45.235	"I would never have said those things."""
49.155	(Laughter)
51.475	I wasn't a person to him
51.475	until I was his professor.
56.515	This concept, called objectification,
59.115	is the foundation of sexism,
61.195	and we see it reinforced
61.195	through every aspect of our lives.
67.635	We see it in the government
69.875	that refuses to punish men
73.315	for raping women.
75.075	We see it in advertisements.
77.395	How many of you have seen an advertisement
79.427	that uses a woman's breast
79.427	to sell an entirely unrelated product?
86.515	Or movie after movie after movie
90.315	that portrays women
90.315	as only love interests?
94.195	These examples might seem
94.195	inconsequential and harmless,
97.835	but they're insidious,
99.115	slowly building into a culture
99.115	that refuses to see women as people.
103.955	We see this in the school
103.955	that sends home a 10-year-old girl
108.169	because her clothes were
108.169	a distraction to boys trying to learn,
111.835	or the government that refuses
111.835	to punish men for raping women
117.035	over and over,
118.635	or the woman who is killed
120.115	because she asked a man to stop
120.115	grinding on her on the dance floor.
127.515	Media plays a large role in perpetuating
127.515	the objectification of women.
133.395	Let's consider
133.395	the classic romantic comedy.
136.235	We're typically introduced
136.235	to two kinds of women in these movies,
140.155	two kinds of desirable women, anyway.
142.915	The first is the sexy bombshell.
145.355	This is the unbelievably gorgeous woman
145.355	with the perfect body.
149.035	Our leading man
149.035	has no trouble identifying her
151.675	and even less trouble having sex with her.
154.755	The second is our leading lady,
156.635	the beautiful but demure woman
156.635	our leading man falls in love with
160.515	despite not noticing her at first
162.675	or not liking her if he did.
165.835	The first is the slut.
167.875	She is to be consumed and forgotten.
169.915	She is much too available.
171.795	The second is desirable but modest,
175.475	and therefore worthy
175.475	of our leading man's future babies.
178.955	Marriage material.
180.755	We're actually told
180.755	that women have two roles,
183.715	but these two roles have a difficult time
183.715	existing within the same woman.
188.555	On the rare occasion
188.555	that I share with a new acquaintance
192.235	that I study sex,
193.995	if they don't end
193.995	the conversation right then,
196.395	they're usually pretty intrigued.
199.315	"""Oh. Tell me more."""
201.115	So I do.
204.195	"""I'm really interested"
204.195	in studying the sexual behaviors
206.835	"of pregnant and postpartum couples."""
208.635	At this point I get
208.635	a different kind of response.
212.195	(Laughter)
214.195	"""Oh. Huh."
216.675	Do pregnant people even have sex?
220.075	Have you thought
220.075	about studying sexual desire
224.035	or orgasms?
225.395	"That would be interesting, and sexy."""
230.115	Tell me. What are the first words
230.115	that come to mind
232.675	when you picture a pregnant woman?
235.275	I asked this question
235.275	in a survey of over 500 adults,
238.715	"and most responded with ""belly"" or ""round"""
242.315	"and ""cute."""
245.035	This didn't surprise me too much.
246.675	What else do we label as cute?
249.835	Babies. Puppies. Kittens.
252.355	The elderly. Right?
254.035	(Laughter)
257.05	When we label an adult as cute, though,
259.731	we take away a lot of their intelligence,
262.235	their complexity.
264.195	We reduce them to childlike qualities.
267.555	I also asked heterosexual men
269.235	to imagine a woman that they're
269.235	partnered with is pregnant,
272.395	and then asked women
272.395	to imagine that they are pregnant,
275.195	and then tell me
275.195	the first words that come to mind
277.835	when they imagine having sex.
280.955	Most of the responses were negative.
284.242	"""Gross."""
285.693	"""Awkward."""
287.09	"""Not sexy."" ""Odd."""
289.555	"""Uncomfortable."""
291.235	"""How?"""
292.515	(Laughter)
295.315	"""Not worth the trouble."""
295.315	"""Not worth the risk."""
298.435	That last one really stuck with me.
301.715	We might think that because we divorce
301.715	pregnant women and moms from sexuality,
306.475	we are removing the constraints
306.475	of sexual objectification.
311.515	They experience less sexism. Right?
314.235	Not exactly.
315.835	What happens instead
315.835	is a different kind of objectification.
319.755	In my efforts to explain this to others,
322.035	one conversation
322.035	led to the Venus of Willendorf,
325.835	a Paleolithic figurine scholars assumed
325.835	was a goddess of love and beauty,
330.675	hence the name Venus.
332.515	This theory was later revised, though,
334.675	when scholars noted
334.675	the sculptor's obvious focus
338.395	on the figurine's reproductive features:
341.835	large breasts,
341.835	considered ideal for nursing;
345.115	a round, possibly pregnant belly;
347.755	the remnants of red dye,
347.755	alluding to menstruation or birth.
352.555	They also assumed that she was
352.555	meant to be held or placed lying down
356.114	because her tiny feet
356.114	don't allow her to be freestanding.
360.515	She also had no face.
362.795	For this reason, it was assumed
362.795	that she was a representation of fertility
366.915	and not a portrait of a person.
369.795	She was an object.
371.675	In the history of her interpretation,
373.515	she went from object
373.515	of ideal beauty and love
376.675	to object of reproduction.
379.355	I think this transition speaks more
381.835	about the scholars
381.835	who have interpreted her purpose
385.635	than the actual purpose
385.635	of the figurine herself.
390.355	When a woman becomes pregnant,
392.475	she leaves the realm
392.475	of men's sexual desire
396.235	and slides into her reproductive
396.235	and child-rearing role.
400.835	In doing so, she also becomes
403.475	the property of the community,
405.275	considered very important
405.275	but only because she's pregnant. Right?
410.315	I've taken to calling this
410.315	the Willendorf effect,
412.835	and once again we see it reinforced
412.835	in many aspects of her life.
417.218	Has anyone here
417.218	ever been visibly pregnant?
419.755	(Laughter)
420.995	Yeah. Lots of you, right?
422.275	So how many of you ever had a stranger
422.275	touch your belly during pregnancy,
426.435	maybe without even asking
426.435	your permission first?
429.795	Or told what you can and cannot eat
432.555	by somebody who is not your doctor,
432.555	your medical care provider?
436.195	Or asked private questions
436.195	about your birth plan?
440.075	And then told why
440.075	those choices are all wrong?
443.555	Yeah, me too.
444.795	Or had a server refuse
444.795	to bring you a glass of wine?
449.075	This one might give you pause,
449.075	I know, but stay with me.
451.835	This is a huge secret.
453.955	It is actually safe to drink
453.955	in moderation during pregnancy.
458.515	Many of us don't know this
460.075	because doctors don't trust
460.075	pregnant women with this secret --
463.835	(Laughter)
469.355	especially if she's less educated
469.355	or a woman of color.
473.635	What this tells us is,
475.395	this Willendorf effect,
475.395	it's also classist and racist.
479.635	It's present when
479.635	the government reminds women
485.555	with every new anti-choice bill
488.235	that the contents of her uterus
488.235	are not her own,
491.115	or when an ob-gyn says,
493.195	"""While it's safe"
493.195	to have sex during pregnancy,
495.515	sometimes you never know.
496.875	"Better safe than sorry, right?"""
499.395	She's denied basic privacy
499.395	and bodily autonomy
503.675	"under the guise of ""be a good mother."""
506.155	We don't trust her
506.155	to make her own decisions.
509.115	She's cute, remember?
513.795	When we tell women
516.115	that sexual pleasure -- excuse me.
519.075	When we tell women that sex
519.075	isn't worth the risk during pregnancy,
523.915	what we're telling her is that
523.915	her sexual pleasure doesn't matter.
528.195	So what we are telling her
528.195	is that she in fact doesn't matter,
531.515	even though the needs of her fetus
531.515	are not at odds with her own needs.
537.195	So medical providers,
539.475	such as the American College
539.475	of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
542.475	have the opportunity to educate
542.475	about the safety of sex during pregnancy.
547.395	So what do the experts say?
549.755	ACOG actually has
549.755	no public official statement
552.275	about the safety of sex during pregnancy.
556.078	Guidance from the Mayo Clinic
556.078	is generally positive
559.115	but presented with a caveat:
561.635	"""Although most women can safely"
561.635	have sex throughout pregnancy,
564.81	"sometimes it's best to be cautious."""
566.955	Some women don't want
566.955	to have sex during pregnancy,
570.075	and that's OK.
571.355	Some women do want
571.355	to have sex during pregnancy,
573.995	and that's OK, too.
575.435	What needs to stop
575.435	is society telling women
578.115	what they can and cannot do
578.115	with their bodies.
581.475	(Applause)
588.035	Pregnant women are not faceless,
588.035	identity-less vessels of reproduction
592.715	who can't stand on their own two feet.
596.115	But the truth is, the real secret is,
598.555	we tell all women that
598.555	their sexual pleasure doesn't matter.
602.835	We refuse to even acknowledge
602.835	that women who have sex with women
606.075	or women who don't
606.075	want children even exist.
608.835	"""Oh, it's just a phase ..."
610.555	she just needs the right man
610.555	"to come along."""
614.155	Every time a woman has sex
616.515	simply because it feels good,
618.515	it is revolutionary.
620.275	She is revolutionary.
622.475	She is pushing back
622.475	against society's insistence
625.075	that she exist simply for men's pleasure
627.315	or for reproduction.
630.435	A woman who prioritizes
630.435	her sexual needs is scary,
634.435	because a woman who prioritizes
634.435	her sexual needs prioritizes herself.
639.595	(Applause)
643.395	That is a woman demanding
643.395	that she be treated as an equal.
647.835	That is a woman who insists
649.395	that you make room for her
649.395	at the table of power,
652.755	and that is the most terrifying of all
654.675	because we can't make room for her
657.515	without some of us giving up
657.515	the extra space we hold.
662.835	(Applause)
668.475	I have one last secret for you.
670.955	I am the mother of two boys
672.835	and we could use your help.
675.315	Even though my boys hear me say regularly
680.035	that it's important for men
680.035	to recognize women as equals
683.595	and they see their father modeling this,
686.155	we need what happens in the world
686.155	to reinforce what happens in our home.
690.595	This is not a men's problem
690.595	or a women's problem.
693.915	This is everyone's problem,
695.515	and we all play a role
695.515	in dismantling systems of inequality.
700.515	For starters, we have got
700.515	to stop telling women
703.155	what they can and cannot do
703.155	with their bodies.
705.595	(Applause)
710.235	This includes not treating pregnant women
710.235	like community property.
714.155	If you don't know her,
714.155	don't even ask to touch her belly.
717.875	You wouldn't anybody else.
719.595	Don't tell her
719.595	what she can and cannot eat.
721.755	Don't ask her private details
721.755	about her medical decisions.
724.795	This also includes understanding
726.715	that even if you are
726.715	personally against abortion,
729.315	you can still fight
729.315	for a woman's right to choose.
732.515	When it comes to women's equality,
732.515	the two need not oppose one another.
736.995	If you're somebody who has sex with women,
739.275	prioritize her pleasure.
740.795	If you don't know how, ask.
744.075	If you have children --
745.595	(Laughter)
747.555	have conversations about sex
747.555	as early as possible,
751.355	because kids don't look up s-e-x
751.355	in the dictionary anymore.
755.755	They look it up on the internet.
758.355	And when you're having
758.355	those conversations about sex,
761.795	don't center them on reproduction only.
763.755	People have sex for many reasons,
765.435	some because they want a baby,
767.235	but most of us have sex
767.235	because it feels good.
770.195	Admit it.
772.795	And regardless of whether
772.795	you have children or not,
775.395	support comprehensive sex education
775.395	that doesn't shame our teenagers.
779.675	(Applause)
788.155	Nothing positive comes from shaming teens
790.755	for their sexual desires, behaviors,
794.155	other than positive STD
794.155	and pregnancy tests.
798.635	Every single day,
798.635	we are all given the opportunity
801.715	to disrupt patterns of inequality.
804.995	I think we can all agree
804.995	that it's worth the trouble to do so.
809.235	Thank you.
810.475	(Applause)
