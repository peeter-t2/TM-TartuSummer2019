15.26	So I'm here to explain
17.26	why I'm wearing these ninja pajamas.
19.26	And to do that, I'd like to talk first
21.26	about environmental toxins in our bodies.
24.26	So some of you may know
26.26	about the chemical Bisphenol A, BPA.
28.26	It's a material hardener and synthetic estrogen
31.26	that's found in the lining of canned foods
33.26	and some plastics.
35.26	So BPA mimics the body's own hormones
38.26	and causes neurological and reproductive problems.
41.26	And it's everywhere.
43.26	A recent study found BPA
45.26	in 93 percent of people six and older.
49.26	But it's just one chemical.
51.26	The Center for Disease Control in the U.S.
54.26	says we have 219 toxic pollutants in our bodies,
58.26	and this includes preservatives, pesticides
61.26	and heavy metals like lead and mercury.
64.26	To me, this says three things.
66.26	First, don't become a cannibal.
70.26	Second, we are both responsible for and the victims of
73.26	our own pollution.
75.26	And third,
77.26	our bodies are filters and storehouses
79.26	for environmental toxins.
82.26	So what happens to all these toxins when we die?
85.26	The short answer is:
87.26	They return to the environment in one way or another,
89.26	continuing the cycle of toxicity.
91.26	But our current funeral practices
93.26	make the situation much worse.
95.26	If you're cremated,
97.26	all those toxins I mentioned are released into the atmosphere.
100.26	And this includes 5,000 pounds of mercury
103.26	from our dental fillings alone every year.
106.26	And in a traditional American funeral,
109.26	a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics
112.26	to make it look alive.
114.26	It's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde
117.26	to slow decomposition --
119.26	a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer
122.26	in funeral personnel.
125.26	So by trying to preserve our dead bodies,
128.26	we deny death, poison the living
131.26	and further harm the environment.
133.26	Green or natural burials, which don't use embalming,
136.26	are a step in the right direction,
138.26	but they don't address the existing toxins in our bodies.
142.26	I think there's a better solution.
144.26	I'm an artist,
146.26	so I'd like to offer a modest proposal
148.26	at the intersection
150.26	of art, science and culture.
152.26	The Infinity Burial Project,
154.26	an alternative burial system
156.26	that uses mushrooms
158.26	to decompose and clean toxins in bodies.
160.26	The Infinity Burial Project
162.26	began a few years ago with a fantasy
164.26	to create the Infinity Mushroom --
166.26	a new hybrid mushroom
168.26	that would decompose bodies, clean the toxins
171.26	and deliver nutrients to plant roots,
173.26	leaving clean compost.
175.26	But I learned it's nearly impossible
177.26	to create a new hybrid mushroom.
179.26	I also learned
181.26	that some of our tastiest mushrooms
183.26	can clean environmental toxins in soil.
185.26	So I thought maybe I could train an army
188.26	of toxin-cleaning edible mushrooms
191.26	to eat my body.
193.26	So today, I'm collecting what I shed or slough off --
196.26	my hair, skin and nails --
199.26	and I'm feeding these to edible mushrooms.
202.26	As the mushrooms grow,
204.26	I pick the best feeders
206.26	to become Infinity Mushrooms.
208.26	It's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process
211.26	for the afterlife.
213.26	So when I die,
215.26	the Infinity Mushrooms will recognize my body
217.26	and be able to eat it.
219.26	All right, so for some of you,
221.26	this may be really, really out there.
223.26	(Laughter)
225.26	Just a little.
227.26	I realize this is not the kind of relationship
230.26	that we usually aspire to have with our food.
233.26	We want to eat, not be eaten by, our food.
236.26	But as I watch the mushrooms grow
238.26	and digest my body,
240.26	I imagine the Infinity Mushroom
242.26	as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death
245.26	and the relationship between my body and the environment.
248.26	See for me,
250.26	cultivating the Infinity Mushroom
252.26	is more than just scientific experimentation
254.26	or gardening or raising a pet,
257.26	it's a step towards accepting the fact
259.26	that someday I will die and decay.
262.26	It's also a step
264.26	towards taking responsibility
266.26	for my own burden on the planet.
269.26	Growing a mushroom is also part of a larger practice
271.26	of cultivating decomposing organisms
273.26	called decompiculture,
275.26	a concept that was developed by an entomologist,
278.26	Timothy Myles.
280.26	The Infinity Mushroom is a subset of decompiculture
283.26	I'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation --
287.26	the cultivation of organisms that decompose
289.26	and clean toxins in bodies.
292.26	And now about these ninja pajamas.
294.26	Once it's completed,
296.26	I plan to integrate the Infinity Mushrooms into a number of objects.
299.26	First, a burial suit
301.26	infused with mushroom spores,
303.26	the Mushroom Death Suit.
305.26	(Laughter)
307.26	I'm wearing the second prototype
309.26	of this burial suit.
311.26	It's covered with a crocheted netting
314.26	that is embedded with mushroom spores.
316.26	The dendritic pattern you see
318.26	mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia,
321.26	which are the equivalent of plant roots.
323.26	I'm also making a decompiculture kit,
325.26	a cocktail of capsules
327.26	that contain Infinity Mushroom spores
329.26	and other elements
331.26	that speed decomposition and toxin remediation.
334.26	These capsules are embedded in a nutrient-rich jelly,
337.26	a kind of second skin,
339.26	which dissolves quickly
341.26	and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms.
344.26	So I plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit
347.26	in the next year or two,
349.26	and then I'd like to begin testing them,
352.26	first with expired meat from the market
354.26	and then with human subjects.
356.26	And believe it or not,
358.26	a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project
361.26	to be eaten by mushrooms.
364.26	(Laughter)
367.26	What I've learned from talking to these folks
369.26	is that we share a common desire
371.26	to understand and accept death
374.26	and to minimize the impact of our death on the environment.
377.26	I wanted to cultivate this perspective
380.26	just like the mushrooms,
382.26	so I formed the Decompiculture Society,
384.26	a group of people called decompinauts
387.26	who actively explore their postmortem options,
390.26	seek death acceptance
392.26	and cultivate decomposing organisms
394.26	like the Infinity Mushroom.
397.26	The Decompiculture Society shares a vision
399.26	of a cultural shift,
401.26	from our current culture of death denial and body preservation
404.26	to one of decompiculture,
406.26	a radical acceptance of death and decomposition.
410.26	Accepting death means accepting
412.26	that we are physical beings
414.26	who are intimately connected to the environment,
416.26	as the research on environmental toxins confirms.
419.26	And the saying goes,
421.26	we came from dust and will return to dust.
424.26	And once we understand that we're connected to the environment,
427.26	we see that the survival of our species
429.26	depends on the survival of the planet.
431.26	I believe this is the beginning
434.26	of true environmental responsibility.
436.26	Thank you.
438.26	(Applause)
