12.46	So what if I could make for you
14.94	a designer baby?
17.94	What if you as a parent-to-be
20.26	and I as a scientist decided
20.26	to go down that road together?
25.86	What if we didn't?
27.14	"What if we thought, ""That's a bad idea,"""
29.94	but many of our family,
29.94	friends and coworkers
33.34	did make that decision?
36.14	Let's fast-forward just 15 years from now.
39.78	Let's pretend it's the year 2030,
42.58	and you're a parent.
44.54	You have your daughter,
44.54	Marianne, next to you,
47.82	and in 2030, she is what we call a natural
51.22	because she has no genetic modifications.
55.1	And because you and your partner
55.1	consciously made that decision,
59.3	many in your social circle,
59.3	they kind of look down on you.
62.54	They think you're, like,
62.54	a Luddite or a technophobe.
67.34	Marianne's best friend Jenna,
67.34	who lives right next door,
70.34	is a very different story.
72.74	She was born a genetically modified
72.74	designer baby with numerous upgrades.
80.54	Yeah. Upgrades.
82.7	And these enhancements were introduced
85.62	using a new genetic
85.62	modification technology
88.18	that goes by the funny name CRISPR,
90.98	you know, like something's crisp,
92.7	this is CRISPR.
95.34	The scientist that Jenna's parents
95.34	hired to do this
98.66	for several million dollars
101.38	introduced CRISPR
101.38	into a whole panel of human embryos.
106.18	And then they used genetic testing,
107.9	and they predicted that
107.9	that little tiny embryo, Jenna's embryo,
111.98	would be the best of the bunch.
114.98	And now, Jenna is an actual, real person.
118.46	She's sitting on the carpet
118.46	in your living room
121.7	playing with your daughter Marianne.
124.9	And your families have known
124.9	each other for years now,
128.02	and it's become very clear to you
130.46	that Jenna is extraordinary.
133.02	She's incredibly intelligent.
135.06	If you're honest with yourself,
135.06	she's smarter than you,
138.34	and she's five years old.
140.859	She's beautiful, tall, athletic,
144.78	and the list goes on and on.
148.1	And in fact, there's
148.1	a whole new generation
150.7	of these GM kids like Jenna.
153.74	And so far it looks like
155.9	they're healthier
155.9	than their parents' generation,
158.26	than your generation.
160.02	And they have lower health care costs.
163.86	They're immune to a host
163.86	of health conditions,
166.62	including HIV/AIDS and genetic diseases.
170.9	It all sounds so great,
173.26	but you can't help but have
173.26	this sort of unsettling feeling,
176.34	a gut feeling, that there's something
176.34	just not quite right about Jenna,
181.98	and you've had the same feeling
181.98	about other GM kids that you've met.
186.94	You were also reading
186.94	in the newspaper earlier this week
190.34	that a study of these children
190.34	who were born as designer babies
194.3	indicates they may have some issues,
196.18	like increased aggressiveness
196.18	and narcissism.
201.46	But more immediately on your mind
203.14	is some news that you just got
203.14	from Jenna's family.
206.86	She's so smart,
208.38	she's now going to be going
208.38	to a special school,
211.5	a different school
211.5	than your daughter Marianne,
214.02	and this is kind of throwing
214.02	your family into a disarray.
217.78	Marianne's been crying,
219.14	and last night when you took her to bed
219.14	to kiss her goodnight,
222.58	"she said, ""Daddy, will Jenna"
222.58	"even be my friend anymore?"""
228.3	So now, as I've been telling you
228.3	this imagined 2030 story,
231.86	I have a feeling
231.86	that I may have put some of you
234.5	into this sci-fi
234.5	frame of reference. Right?
237.1	You think you're reading a sci-fi book.
239.62	Or maybe, like,
239.62	in Halloween mode of thinking.
242.58	But this is really
242.58	a possible reality for us,
245.02	just 15 years from now.
247.3	I'm a stem cell and genetics researcher
250.26	and I can see this new CRISPR technology
253.22	and its potential impact.
255.42	And we may find ourselves in that reality,
259.06	and a lot will depend
259.06	on what we decide to do today.
263.78	And if you're still
263.78	kind of thinking in sci-fi mode,
266.3	consider that the world of science
266.3	had a huge shock earlier this year,
270.82	and the public largely
270.82	doesn't even know about it.
273.779	Researchers in China just a few months ago
276.58	reported the creation
276.58	of genetically modified human embryos.
281.26	This was the first time in history.
283.82	And they did it using
283.82	this new CRISPR technology.
287.38	It didn't work perfectly,
289.14	but I still think
289.14	they sort of cracked the door ajar
292.74	on a Pandora's box here.
296.3	And I think some people
296.3	are going to run with this technology
299.22	and try to make designer babies.
302.02	Now, before I go on, some of you
302.02	may hold up your hands and say,
305.1	"""Stop, Paul, wait a minute."
307.38	Wouldn't that be illegal?
309.22	You can't just go off
309.22	"and create a designer baby."""
313.476	And in fact, to some extent, you're right.
315.5	In some countries, you couldn't do that.
318.34	But in many other countries,
318.34	including my country, the US,
321.62	there's actually no law on this,
321.62	so in theory, you could do it.
326.5	And there was another development
326.5	this year that resonates in this area,
330.98	and that happened
330.98	not so far from here over in the UK.
334.3	And the UK traditionally
334.3	has been the strictest country
337.42	when it comes to human
337.42	genetic modification.
340.26	It was illegal there,
342.22	but just a few months ago,
343.82	they carved out an exception to that rule.
346.3	They passed a new law
347.86	allowing the creation
347.86	of genetically modified humans
351.34	with the noble goal of trying
351.34	to prevent a rare kind of genetic disease.
356.22	But still I think in combination
356.22	these events are pushing us
359.94	further towards an acceptance
362.5	of human genetic modification.
365.66	So I've been talking
365.66	about this CRISPR technology.
368.58	What actually is CRISPR?
371.18	So if you think about the GMOs
371.18	that we're all more familiar with,
374.54	like GMO tomatoes and wheat
377.78	and things like that,
379.74	this technology
379.74	is similar to the technologies
382.38	that were used to make those,
384.26	but it's dramatically better,
386.66	cheaper and faster.
389.94	So what is it?
391.5	It's actually like
391.5	a genetic Swiss army knife.
393.98	We can pretend this is a Swiss army knife
396.26	with different tools in it,
397.62	and one of the tools
397.62	is kind of like a magnifying glass
400.78	or a GPS for our DNA,
403.7	so it can home in on a certain spot.
406.3	And the next tool is like scissors
407.98	that can cut the DNA right in that spot.
411.26	And finally we have a pen
412.86	where we can literally rewrite
412.86	the genetic code in that location.
417.38	It's really that simple.
419.5	And this technology, which came
419.5	on the scene just three years ago,
423.18	has taken science by storm.
425.82	It's evolving so fast, and it's
425.82	so freaking exciting to scientists,
430.1	and I admit I'm fascinated by it
430.1	and we use it in my own lab,
434.86	that I think someone
434.86	is going to go that extra step
438.46	and continue the GM human embryo work
441.06	and maybe make designer babies.
444.9	This is so ubiquitous now.
446.58	It just came on the scene three years ago.
449.02	Thousands of labs
449.02	literally have this in hand today,
453.38	and they're doing important research.
455.78	Most of them are not interested
455.78	in designer babies.
458.42	They're studying human disease
460.94	and other important elements of science.
463.38	So there's a lot of good research
463.38	going on with CRISPR.
466.82	And the fact that we can
466.82	now do genetic modifications
470.26	that used to take years
470.26	and cost millions of dollars
474.06	in a few weeks
474.06	for a couple thousand bucks,
477.1	to me as a scientist that's fantastic,
479.26	but again, at the same time,
481.42	it opens the door to people going too far.
485.14	And I think for some people
486.58	the focus is not going to be
486.58	so much on science.
489.62	That's not what's going
489.62	to be driving them.
491.66	It's going to be ideology
491.66	or the chase for a profit.
495.94	And they're going to go
495.94	for designer babies.
500.06	So why should we be concerned about this?
503.94	We know from Darwin,
503.94	if we go back two centuries,
507.18	that evolution and genetics
507.18	profoundly have impacted humanity,
511.34	who we are today.
513.5	And some think there's like
513.5	a social Darwinism at work in our world,
517.46	and maybe even a eugenics as well.
520.54	Imagine those trends, those forces,
524.3	with a booster rocket
524.3	of this CRISPR technology
527.3	that is so powerful and so ubiquitous.
530.82	And in fact, we can just go back
530.82	one century to the last century
534.739	to see the power that eugenics can have.
538.62	So my father, Peter Knoepfler,
541.1	was actually born right here in Vienna.
543.9	He was Viennese,
543.9	and he was born here in 1929.
548.42	And when my grandparents
548.42	had little baby Peter,
552.34	the world was very different. Right?
554.1	It was a different Vienna.
555.42	The United States was different.
557.02	The world was different.
558.3	There was a eugenics rising,
560.62	and my grandparents realized,
562.98	pretty quickly I think,
564.42	that they were on the wrong side
564.42	of the eugenics equation.
568.66	And so despite this being their home
571.06	and their whole extended family's home,
573.14	and this area being their family's
573.14	home for generations,
577.5	they decided because of eugenics
580.54	that they had to leave.
582.5	And they survived,
582.5	but they were heartbroken,
584.66	and I'm not sure my dad
584.66	ever really got over leaving Vienna.
588.82	He left when he was just eight years old
591.18	in 1938.
594.38	So today, I see a new eugenics
597.46	kind of bubbling to the surface.
599.82	It's supposed to be a kinder,
599.82	gentler, positive eugenics,
604.82	different than all that past stuff.
608.02	But I think even though it's focused
608.02	on trying to improve people,
612.42	it could have negative consequences,
615.14	and it really worries me
616.42	that some of the top proponents
616.42	of this new eugenics,
619.22	they think CRISPR is the ticket
619.22	to make it happen.
624.18	So I have to admit, you know,
625.94	eugenics, we talk
625.94	about making better people.
629.22	It's a tough question.
630.5	What is better when we're talking
630.5	about a human being?
634.18	But I admit I think maybe a lot of us
636.86	could agree that human beings,
639.82	maybe we could use a little betterment.
641.82	Look at our politicians
644.14	here, you know, back in the US --
646.22	God forbid we go there right now.
649.86	Maybe even if we just look in the mirror,
651.86	there might be ways
651.86	we think we could be better.
654.42	I might wish, honestly, that I had
654.42	more hair here, instead of baldness.
659.26	Some people might wish they were taller,
661.82	have a different weight, a different face.
665.7	If we could do those things,
665.7	we could make those things happen,
669.18	or we could make them happen
669.18	in our children,
671.46	it would be very seductive.
673.86	And yet coming with it
673.86	would be these risks.
676.78	I talked about eugenics,
678.7	but there would be risks
678.7	to individuals as well.
681.54	So if we forget about enhancing people
684.02	and we just try to make them
684.02	healthier using genetic modification,
688.5	this technology is so new
690.98	and so powerful,
692.58	that by accident
692.58	we could make them sicker.
696.34	That easily could happen.
698.5	And there's another risk,
699.78	and that is that all of the legitimate,
699.78	important genetic modification research
704.38	going on just in the lab --
706.06	again, no interest in designer babies --
709.1	a few people going
709.1	the designer baby route,
711.98	things go badly,
713.38	that entire field could be damaged.
717.26	I also think it's not that unlikely
719.74	that governments might start taking
719.74	an interest in genetic modification.
724.7	So for example our imagined GM Jenna child
729.66	who is healthier,
730.9	if there's a generation that looks
730.9	like they have lower health care costs,
734.94	it's possible that governments
734.94	may start trying to compel their citizens
739.18	to go the GM route.
741.1	Look at China's one-child policy.
743.14	It's thought that that prevented
743.14	the birth of 400 million human beings.
750.02	So it's not beyond the realm of possible
752.82	that genetic modification
752.82	could be something that governments push.
757.1	And if designer babies become popular,
760.62	in our digital age --
762.46	viral videos, social media --
765.14	what if designer babies
765.14	are thought to be fashionable,
767.74	and they kind of become
767.74	the new glitterati,
769.9	the new Kardashians or something?
771.66	(Laughter)
772.7	You know, are those trends
772.7	that we really could control?
777.26	I'm not convinced that we could.
780.46	So again, today it's Halloween
783.66	and when we talk
783.66	about genetic modification,
786.14	there's one Halloween-associated character
789.3	that is talked about
789.3	or invoked more than anything else,
791.98	and that is Frankenstein.
794.42	Mostly that's been Frankenfoods
794.42	and all this other stuff.
798.86	But if we think about this now
798.86	and we think about it in the human context
803.46	on a day like Halloween,
804.74	if parents can in essence
804.74	costume their children genetically,
810.18	are we going to be talking about
810.18	a Frankenstein 2.0 kind of situation?
816.06	I don't think so. I don't think
816.06	it's going to get to that extreme.
819.26	But when we are going about
819.26	hacking the human code,
823.26	I think all bets are off
823.26	in terms of what might come of that.
826.54	There would still be dangers.
829.54	And we can look in the past
830.9	to other elements
830.9	of transformative science
833.54	and see how they can
833.54	basically go out of control
837.38	and permeate society.
839.38	So I'll just give you one example,
839.38	and that is in vitro fertilization.
844.3	Almost exactly 40 years ago,
847.94	test tube baby number one
847.94	Louise Brown was born,
851.66	and that's a great thing,
852.94	and I think since then
852.94	five million IVF babies have been born,
858.5	bringing immeasurable happiness.
860.18	A lot of parents now can love those kids.
863.34	But if you think about it,
863.34	in four decades,
865.42	five million babies being born
865.42	from a new technology
869.34	is pretty remarkable,
871.18	and the same kind of thing could happen
873.42	with human genetic modification
873.42	and designer babies.
877.02	So depending on the decisions
877.02	we make in the next few months,
880.22	the next year or so,
881.54	if designer baby number one is born,
884.7	within a few decades,
885.94	there could well be millions
885.94	of genetically modified humans.
889.62	And there's a difference there too,
889.62	because if we, you in the audience, or I,
894.1	if we decide to have a designer baby,
897.02	then their children will also
897.02	be genetically modified, and so on,
901.06	because it's heritable.
902.38	So that's a big difference.
905.42	So with all of this in mind,
907.34	what should we do?
909.94	There's actually going to be a meeting
911.78	a month from tomorrow in Washington, D.C.
914.7	by the US National Academy of Sciences
916.66	to tackle that exact question.
919.3	What is the right path forward
919.3	with human genetic modification?
923.82	I believe at this time
926.26	we need a moratorium.
927.74	We have to ban this.
929.26	We should not allow
929.26	creating genetically modified people,
932.86	because it's just too dangerous
932.86	and too unpredictable.
937.18	But there's a lot of people --
938.66	(Applause)
939.82	Thanks.
941.06	(Applause)
947.7	And let me say, just as a scientist,
950.02	it's a little bit scary
950.02	for me to say that in public,
952.54	because science generally doesn't like
952.54	self-regulation and things like that.
959.06	So I think we need to put a hold on this,
962.22	but there are many people
962.22	who not only disagree with me,
964.98	they feel the exact opposite.
966.5	They're like, step on the gas,
966.5	full speed ahead,
969.86	let's make designer babies.
971.5	And so in the meeting in December
974.46	and other meetings that are likely
974.46	to follow in the next few months,
977.94	it's very possible
977.94	there may be no moratorium.
981.1	And I think part
981.1	of the problem that we have
984.18	is that all of this trend,
986.26	this revolution in genetic modification
986.26	applying to humans,
990.38	the public hasn't known about it.
992.02	Nobody has been saying,
993.86	look, this is a big deal,
993.86	this is a revolution,
997.94	and this could affect you
997.94	in very personal ways.
1000.22	And so part of my goal
1000.22	is actually to change that
1003.06	and to educate and engage with the public
1006.02	and get you guys talking about this.
1009.34	And so I hope at these meetings
1009.34	that there will be a role for the public
1013.14	to bring their voice to bear as well.
1017.5	So if we kind of circle back now
1017.5	to 2030 again, that imagined story,
1023.02	and depending on the decisions
1023.02	we make, again, today --
1026.06	literally we don't have a lot of time --
1028.02	in the next few months,
1028.02	the next year or so,
1030.14	because this technology
1030.14	is spreading like wildfire.
1033.38	Let's pretend we're back in that reality.
1036.34	We're at a park,
1038.179	and our kid is swinging on the swing.
1042.419	Is that kid a regular old kid,
1045.06	or did we decide to have a designer baby?
1048.54	And let's say we went
1048.54	the sort of traditional route,
1052.02	and there's our kid swinging on the swing,
1054.54	and frankly, they're kind of a mess.
1057.38	Their hair is all over
1057.38	the place like mine.
1060.1	They have a stuffy nose.
1062.34	They're not the best student in the world.
1065.06	They're adorable, you love them,
1067.3	but there on the swing next to them,
1069.26	their best friend is a GM kid,
1072.3	and the two of them
1072.3	are kind of swinging like this,
1074.74	and you can't help
1074.74	but compare them, right?
1076.78	And the GM kid is swinging higher,
1079.3	they look better,
1079.3	they're a better student,
1081.5	they don't have that stuffy nose
1081.5	you need to wipe.
1084.5	How is that going to make you feel
1086.78	and what decision
1086.78	might you make next time?
1090.66	Thank you.
