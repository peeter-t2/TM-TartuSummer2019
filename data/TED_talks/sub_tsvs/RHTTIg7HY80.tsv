25	If you'd like to learn how to play the lobster, we have some here.
28	And that's not a joke, we really do.
30	So come up afterwards and I'll show you how to play a lobster.
33	So, actually, I started working on what's called the mantis shrimp
37	a few years ago because they make sound.
40	This is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp
42	that's found off the coast of California.
55	And while that's an absolutely fascinating sound,
58	it actually turns out to be a very difficult project.
61	And while I was struggling to figure out how and why mantis shrimp,
66	or stomatopods, make sound, I started to think about their appendages.
70	"And mantis shrimp are called ""mantis shrimp"" after the praying mantises,"
73	which also have a fast feeding appendage. And I started to think,
77	well, maybe it will be interesting, while listening to their sounds,
80	to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes.
83	And so today I'll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike,
87	work that I've done in collaboration with Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell.
90	So, mantis shrimp come in two varieties:
93	there are spearers and smashers.
95	And this is a spearing mantis shrimp, or stomatopod.
98	And he lives in the sand, and he catches things that go by overhead.
103	So, a quick strike like that. And if we slow it down a bit,
108	this is the mantis shrimp -- the same species --
110	recorded at 1,000 frames a second,
112	played back at 15 frames per second.
114	And you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs,
120	exploding upward to actually just catch
123	a dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it.
125	Now, the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod,
130	and these guys open up snails for a living.
133	And so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack.
138	(Laughter)
139	So, I'll play it one more time.
141	He wiggles it in place, tugs it with his nose, and smash.
145	And a few smashes later, the snail is broken open, and he's got a good dinner.
152	So, the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end,
156	or it can smash with the heel.
158	And today I'll talk about the smashing type of strike.
161	And so the first question that came to mind was,
163	well, how fast does this limb move?
166	Because it's moving pretty darn fast on that video.
169	And I immediately came upon a problem.
172	Every single high-speed video system in the biology department
175	at Berkeley wasn't fast enough to catch this movement.
179	We simply couldn't capture it on video.
181	And so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time.
184	And then a BBC crew came cruising through the biology department,
187	looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology.
192	And so we struck up a deal.
194	"I said, ""Well, if you guys rent the high-speed video system"
196	that could capture these movements,
198	"you guys can film us collecting the data."""
201	And believe it or not, they went for it. (Laughter)
203	So we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology --
207	it just came out about a year ago --
209	that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light.
214	And low light is a critical issue with filming animals,
216	because if it's too high, you fry them. (Laughter)
219	So this is a mantis shrimp. There are the eyes up here,
224	and there's that raptorial appendage, and there's the heel.
227	And that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail.
230	And the snail's wired to a stick,
231	so he's a little bit easier to set up the shot. And -- yeah.
235	(Laughter)
237	I hope there aren't any snail rights activists around here.
240	(Laughter)
242	So this was filmed at 5,000 frames per second,
247	and I'm playing it back at 15. And so this is slowed down 333 times.
252	And as you'll notice, it's still pretty gosh darn fast
255	slowed down 333 times. It's an incredibly powerful movement.
259	The whole limb extends out. The body flexes backwards --
262	just a spectacular movement.
265	And so what we did is, we took a look at these videos,
267	and we measured how fast the limb was moving
269	to get back to that original question.
271	And we were in for our first surprise.
274	So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving
277	at the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second
279	all the way up to 23 meters per second.
281	And for those of you who prefer miles per hour,
283	that's over 45 miles per hour in water. And this is really darn fast.
288	In fact, it's so fast we were able to add a new point
292	on the extreme animal movement spectrum.
295	And mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike
298	of any animal system. So our first surprise.
302	(Applause)
303	So that was really cool and very unexpected.
306	So, you might be wondering, well, how do they do it?
309	And actually, this work was done in the 1960s
312	by a famous biologist named Malcolm Burrows.
314	And what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use
317	"what's called a ""catch mechanism,"" or ""click mechanism."""
320	And what this basically consists of is a large muscle
324	that takes a good long time to contract,
326	and a latch that prevents anything from moving.
329	So the muscle contracts, and nothing happens.
331	And once the muscle's contracted completely, everything's stored up --
334	the latch flies upward, and you've got the movement.
338	"And that's basically what's called a ""power amplification system."""
341	It takes a long time for the muscle to contract,
343	and a very short time for the limb to fly out.
345	And so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story.
348	This was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes.
352	But then I took a trip to the National Museum of Natural History.
356	And if any of you ever have a chance,
358	backstage of the National Museum of Natural History
360	is one of the world's best collections of preserved mantis shrimp. And what --
364	(Laughter)
365	this is serious business for me.
367	(Laughter)
368	So, this -- what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb,
373	whether it's a spearer or a smasher,
375	is a beautiful saddle-shaped structure
377	right on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here.
381	It just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse.
383	It's a very beautiful structure.
385	And it's surrounded by membranous areas. And those membranous areas
390	suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure.
394	And this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while.
397	And then we did a series of calculations, and what we were able to show
401	is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring.
405	There needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism
408	in order to generate the amount of force that we observe,
410	and the speed that we observe, and the output of the system.
413	So we thought, OK, this must be a spring --
416	the saddle could very well be a spring.
418	And we went back to those high-speed videos again,
420	and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending.
426	And I'll just do that one more time.
429	And then if you take a look at the video --
431	it's a little bit hard to see -- it's outlined in yellow.
433	The saddle is outlined in yellow. You can actually see it
435	extending over the course of the strike, and actually hyperextending.
439	So, we've had very solid evidence showing
441	that that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends,
445	and does, in fact, function as a spring.
447	"The saddle-shaped structure is also known as a ""hyperbolic paraboloid surface,"""
452	"or an ""anticlastic surface."""
454	And this is very well known to engineers and architects,
456	because it's a very strong surface in compression.
459	It has curves in two directions,
461	one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other,
464	so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces
467	over the surface of this type of shape.
470	So it's very well known to engineers, not as well known to biologists.
474	It's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry,
478	because it requires very little material
481	to build this type of surface, and it's very strong.
484	So if you're going to build a thin gold structure,
486	it's very nice to have it in a shape that's strong.
488	Now, it's also known to architects. One of the most famous architects
493	is Eduardo Catalano, who popularized this structure.
496	And what's shown here is a saddle-shaped roof that he built
499	that's 87 and a half feet spanwise.
503	It's two and a half inches thick, and supported at two points.
506	And one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's --
511	he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure
515	that's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points.
519	And all of these are the same principles that apply
523	to the saddle-shaped spring in stomatopods.
525	In biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot
528	of extra material requirements for building it.
531	So, very interesting parallels between the biological
534	and the engineering worlds. And interestingly, this turns out --
538	the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first
540	described biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring.
543	That's a bit long, but it is sort of interesting.
546	So the next and final question was, well, how much force
549	does a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails?
553	And so I wired up what's called a load cell.
555	A load cell measures forces, and this is actually
557	a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it.
560	And when this crystal is squeezed, the electrical properties change
564	and it -- which -- in proportion to the forces that go in.
566	So these animals are wonderfully aggressive,
569	and are really hungry all the time. And so all I had to do
572	was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell,
575	and they'd smash away at it.
577	And so this is just a regular video of the animal
581	just smashing the heck out of this load cell.
584	And we were able to get some force measurements out.
587	And again, we were in for a surprise.
589	I purchased a 100-pound load cell, thinking,
591	no animal could produce more than 100 pounds at this size of an animal.
595	And what do you know? They immediately overloaded the load cell.
597	So these are actually some old data
599	where I had to find the smallest animals in the lab,
601	and we were able to measure forces of well over 100 pounds
604	generated by an animal about this big.
607	And actually, just last week I got a 300-pound load cell
609	up and running, and I've clocked these animals generating
612	well over 200 pounds of force.
614	And again, I think this will be a world record.
617	I have to do a little bit more background reading,
619	but I think this will be the largest amount of force produced
622	by an animal of a given -- per body mass. So, really incredible forces.
627	And again, that brings us back to the importance of that spring
630	in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system.
634	But that was not the end of the story.
636	Now, things -- I'm making this sound very easy, this is actually a lot of work.
639	And I got all these force measurements,
641	and then I went and looked at the force output of the system.
645	And this is just very simple -- time is on the X-axis
648	and the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks.
651	And that was what really got me puzzled.
655	The first peak, obviously, is the limb hitting the load cell.
658	But there's a really large second peak half a millisecond later,
664	and I didn't know what that was.
666	So now, you'd expect a second peak for other reasons,
669	but not half a millisecond later.
671	Again, going back to those high-speed videos,
673	there's a pretty good hint of what might be going on.
677	Here's that same orientation that we saw earlier.
679	There's that raptorial appendage -- there's the heel,
682	and it's going to swing around and hit the load cell.
685	And what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this,
688	on the surface of the load cell, as the limb comes flying through.
693	And I hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light.
698	Audience: Wow.
700	Sheila Patek: And so if we just take that one frame, what you can actually see there
704	at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble.
707	And what that is, is cavitation.
709	And cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon
713	which occurs when you have areas of water
716	moving at extremely different speeds.
718	And when this happens, it can cause areas of very low pressure,
722	which results in the water literally vaporizing.
725	And when that vapor bubble collapses, it emits sound, light and heat,
729	and it's a very destructive process.
731	And so here it is in the stomatopod. And again, this is a situation
736	where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon,
739	because it destroys boat propellers.
741	People have been struggling for years to try and design
744	a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate
748	and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it,
750	just like these pictures show.
752	So this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further,
761	I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail.
764	This is taken at 20,000 frames per second, and I have to give
768	full credit to the BBC cameraman, Tim Green, for setting this shot up,
772	because I could never have done this in a million years --
775	one of the benefits of working with professional cameramen.
778	You can see it coming in, and an incredible flash of light,
782	and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail.
786	So really, just an amazing image,
789	slowed down extremely, to extremely slow speeds.
793	And again, we can see it in slightly different form there,
796	with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces.
800	In fact, you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb.
805	So to solve this quandary of the two force peaks:
808	what I think was going on is: that first impact is actually
810	the limb hitting the load cell, and the second impact is actually
813	the collapse of the cavitation bubble.
815	And these animals may very well be making use of
818	not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring,
822	but the extremes of the fluid dynamics. And they might actually be
826	making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail.
830	So, really fascinating double whammy, so to speak, from these animals.
836	So, one question I often get after this talk --
838	so I figured I'd answer it now -- is, well, what happens to the animal?
841	Because obviously, if it's breaking snails,
844	the poor limb must be disintegrating. And indeed it does.
847	That's the smashing part of the heel on both these images,
850	and it gets worn away. In fact, I've seen them wear away
852	their heel all the way to the flesh.
854	But one of the convenient things about being an arthropod
857	is that you have to molt. And every three months or so
860	these animals molt, and they build a new limb and it's no problem.
865	Very, very convenient solution to that particular problem.
869	So, I'd like to end on sort of a wacky note.
874	(Laughter)
877	Maybe this is all wacky to folks like you, I don't know.
881	(Laughter)
882	So, the saddles -- that saddle-shaped spring --
885	has actually been well known to biologists for a long time,
889	not as a spring but as a visual signal.
893	And there's actually a spectacular colored dot
895	in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods.
901	And this is quite interesting, to find evolutionary origins
904	of visual signals on what's really, in all species, their spring.
910	And I think one explanation for this could be
912	going back to the molting phenomenon.
914	So these animals go into a molting period where they're
917	unable to strike -- their bodies become very soft.
920	And they're literally unable to strike or they will self-destruct.
923	This is for real. And what they do is, up until that time period
930	when they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful,
933	and they strike everything in sight; it doesn't matter who or what.
937	And the second they get into that time point when they can't strike any more,
941	they just signal. They wave their legs around.
944	And it's one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing.
948	It's a well-established fact of these animals
950	that they actually bluff. They can't actually strike, but they pretend to.
954	And so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots
956	in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information
960	about their ability to strike, or their strike force,
963	and something about the time period in the molting cycle.
966	So sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure
971	right in the middle of their spring.
974	So to conclude, I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators,
979	Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell, who worked closely with me on this.
982	And also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science,
985	which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time,
989	and for that I'm very grateful. Thank you very much.
992	(Applause)
