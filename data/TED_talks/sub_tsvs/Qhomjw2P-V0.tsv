12.58	How many companies
12.58	have you interacted with today?
17.06	Well, you got up in the morning,
18.74	took a shower,
19.98	washed your hair,
21.26	used a hair dryer,
22.82	ate breakfast --
24.06	ate cereals, fruit, yogurt, whatever --
25.942	had coffee --
27.18	tea.
28.58	You took public transport to come here,
30.58	or maybe used your private car.
33.34	You interacted with the company
33.34	that you work for or that you own.
37.98	You interacted with your clients,
40.58	your customers,
42.46	and so on and so forth.
43.74	I'm pretty sure there are
43.74	at least seven companies
47.38	you've interacted with today.
49.78	Let me tell you a stunning statistic.
52.66	One out of seven
52.66	large, public corporations
57.06	commit fraud every year.
60.22	This is a US academic study
60.22	that looks at US companies --
63.66	I have no reason to believe
63.66	that it's different in Europe.
67.3	This is a study that looks
67.3	at both detected and undetected fraud
71.54	using statistical methods.
73.3	This is not petty fraud.
75.94	These frauds cost
75.94	the shareholders of these companies,
78.82	and therefore society,
80.1	on the order of
84.78	We can all think of some examples, right?
87.02	The car industry's secrets
87.02	aren't quite so secret anymore.
91.62	Fraud has become a feature,
94.94	not a bug,
96.18	of the financial services industry.
98.14	That's not me who's claiming that,
100.38	that's the president
100.38	of the American Finance Association
103.66	who stated that
103.66	in his presidential address.
106.62	That's a huge problem
106.62	if you think about, especially,
109.38	an economy like Switzerland,
111.1	which relies so much on the trust
111.1	put into its financial industry.
116.78	On the other hand,
118.02	there are six out of seven companies
118.02	who actually remain honest
121.58	despite all temptations
121.58	to start engaging in fraud.
126.06	There are whistle-blowers
126.06	like Michael Woodford,
128.38	who blew the whistle on Olympus.
130.74	These whistle-blowers risk their careers,
133.46	their friendships,
134.7	to bring out the truth
134.7	about their companies.
136.86	There are journalists
136.86	like Anna Politkovskaya
139.5	who risk even their lives
139.5	to report human rights violations.
143.38	She got killed --
144.62	every year,
145.86	around 100 journalists get killed
147.54	because of their conviction
147.54	to bring out the truth.
151.86	So in my talk today,
153.14	I want to share with you
153.14	some insights I've obtained and learned
156.66	in the last 10 years
156.66	of conducting research in this.
159.98	I'm a researcher,
159.98	a scientist working with economists,
163.5	financial economists,
164.86	ethicists, neuroscientists,
166.94	lawyers and others
168.3	trying to understand
168.3	what makes humans tick,
170.42	and how can we address this issue
170.42	of fraud in corporations
175.22	and therefore contribute
175.22	to the improvement of the world.
179.1	I want to start by sharing with you
179.1	two very distinct visions
182.66	of how people behave.
184.5	First, meet Adam Smith,
187.02	founding father of modern economics.
190.1	His basic idea was that if everybody
190.1	behaves in their own self-interests,
194.42	that's good for everybody in the end.
197.9	Self-interest isn't
197.9	a narrowly defined concept
200.98	just for your immediate utility.
202.94	It has a long-run implication.
204.9	Let's think about that.
206.9	Think about this dog here.
208.94	That might be us.
211.26	There's this temptation --
212.54	I apologize to all vegetarians, but --
214.94	(Laughter)
215.98	Dogs do like the bratwurst.
217.7	(Laughter)
220.1	Now, the straight-up,
220.1	self-interested move here
223.22	is to go for that.
224.82	So my friend Adam here might jump up,
227.78	get the sausage and thereby ruin
227.78	all this beautiful tableware.
231.82	But that's not what Adam Smith meant.
233.66	He didn't mean
233.66	disregard all consequences --
236.34	to the contrary.
237.58	He would have thought,
238.86	well, there may be negative consequences,
240.9	for example,
242.14	the owner might be angry with the dog
245.26	and the dog, anticipating that,
245.26	might not behave in this way.
249.66	That might be us,
250.94	weighing the benefits
250.94	and costs of our actions.
254.02	How does that play out?
255.78	Well, many of you, I'm sure,
257.78	have in your companies,
259.34	especially if it's a large company,
261.18	a code of conduct.
262.86	And then if you behave
262.86	according to that code of conduct,
266.3	that improves your chances
266.3	of getting a bonus payment.
269.5	And on the other hand,
269.5	if you disregard it,
271.659	then there are higher chances
271.659	of not getting your bonus
274.42	or its being diminished.
275.98	In other words,
277.26	this is a very economic motivation
279.1	of trying to get people to be more honest,
281.9	or more aligned with
281.9	the corporation's principles.
286.06	Similarly, reputation is a very
286.06	powerful economic force, right?
291.34	We try to build a reputation,
292.9	maybe for being honest,
294.34	because then people
294.34	trust us more in the future.
297.78	Right?
299.02	Adam Smith talked about the baker
301.14	who's not producing good bread
301.14	out of his benevolence
304.94	for those people who consume the bread,
307.98	but because he wants to sell
307.98	more future bread.
311.98	In my research, we find, for example,
314.22	at the University of Zurich,
315.62	that Swiss banks
315.62	who get caught up in media,
320.54	and in the context, for example,
322.34	of tax evasion, of tax fraud,
323.9	have bad media coverage.
325.66	They lose net new money in the future
328.42	and therefore make lower profits.
330.06	That's a very powerful reputational force.
334.02	Benefits and costs.
336.94	Here's another viewpoint of the world.
339.54	Meet Immanuel Kant,
344.74	He developed this notion
346.38	that independent of the consequences,
349.54	some actions are just right
352.54	and some are just wrong.
354.26	It's just wrong to lie, for example.
357.5	So, meet my friend Immanuel here.
360.66	He knows that the sausage is very tasty,
363.5	but he's going to turn away
363.5	because he's a good dog.
365.98	He knows it's wrong to jump up
368.7	and risk ruining
368.7	all this beautiful tableware.
372.34	If you believe that people
372.34	are motivated like that,
374.78	then all the stuff about incentives,
376.98	all the stuff about code of conduct
376.98	and bonus systems and so on,
380.78	doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
382.98	People are motivated
382.98	by different values perhaps.
387.18	So, what are people actually motivated by?
390.58	These two gentlemen here
390.58	have perfect hairdos,
392.78	but they give us
392.78	very different views of the world.
397.66	What do we do with this?
398.94	Well, I'm an economist
400.62	and we conduct so-called experiments
400.62	to address this issue.
404.82	We strip away facts
404.82	which are confusing in reality.
408.14	Reality is so rich,
408.14	there is so much going on,
410.9	it's almost impossible to know
410.9	what drives people's behavior really.
415.34	So let's do a little experiment together.
418.5	Imagine the following situation.
422.22	You're in a room alone,
424.66	not like here.
426.22	There's a five-franc coin
426.22	like the one I'm holding up right now
430.38	in front of you.
431.98	Here are your instructions:
433.58	toss the coin four times,
437.62	and then on a computer
437.62	terminal in front of you,
440.06	enter the number of times tails came up.
443.74	This is the situation.
445.54	Here's the rub.
446.78	For every time that you announce
446.78	that you had a tails throw,
450.18	you get paid five francs.
451.7	So if you say I had two tails throws,
454.26	you get paid 10 francs.
456.5	If you say you had zero,
456.5	you get paid zero francs.
459.46	"If you say, ""I had four tails throws,"""
461.94	then you get paid 20 francs.
463.98	It's anonymous,
465.26	nobody's watching what you're doing,
467.18	and you get paid that money anonymously.
469.54	I've got two questions for you.
471.58	(Laughter)
473.22	You know what's coming now, right?
475.82	First, how would you behave
475.82	in that situation?
480.06	The second, look to your left
480.06	and look to your right --
483.02	(Laughter)
484.06	and think about how
484.06	the person sitting next to you
486.46	might behave in that situation.
488.14	We did this experiment for real.
490.3	We did it at the Manifesta art exhibition
493.02	that took place here in Zurich recently,
495.5	not with students in the lab
495.5	at the university
498.38	but with the real population,
500.18	like you guys.
501.9	First, a quick reminder of stats.
504.06	If I throw the coin four times
504.06	and it's a fair coin,
507.66	then the probability
507.66	that it comes up four times tails
511.78	is 6.25 percent.
514.9	And I hope you can intuitively see
516.58	that the probability that all four
516.58	of them are tails is much lower
519.98	than if two of them are tails, right?
522.58	Here are the specific numbers.
525.859	Here's what happened.
527.379	People did this experiment for real.
530.619	Around 30 to 35 percent of people said,
533.979	"""Well, I had four tails throws."""
537.46	That's extremely unlikely.
539.3	(Laughter)
541.26	But the really amazing thing here,
544.42	perhaps to an economist,
545.74	is there are around 65 percent of people
545.74	who did not say I had four tails throws,
552.3	even though in that situation,
554.5	nobody's watching you,
556.62	the only consequence that's in place
558.58	is you get more money
558.58	if you say four than less.
561.94	You leave 20 francs on the table
561.94	by announcing zero.
565.86	I don't know whether
565.86	the other people all were honest
568.46	or whether they also said a little bit
568.46	higher or lower than what they did
571.94	because it's anonymous.
573.18	We only observed the distribution.
574.86	But what I can tell you --
574.86	and here's another coin toss.
577.54	There you go, it's tails.
579.06	(Laughter)
580.58	Don't check, OK?
582.06	(Laughter)
584.9	What I can tell you
586.22	is that not everybody behaved
586.22	like Adam Smith would have predicted.
592.66	So what does that leave us with?
594.26	Well, it seems people are motivated
594.26	by certain intrinsic values
598.78	and in our research, we look at this.
601.26	We look at the idea that people have
601.26	so-called protected values.
606.58	A protected value isn't just any value.
609.42	A protected value is a value
609.42	where you're willing to pay a price
615.26	to uphold that value.
616.54	You're willing to pay a price
616.54	to withstand the temptation to give in.
622.02	And the consequence is you feel better
624.7	if you earn money in a way
624.7	that's consistent with your values.
629.02	Let me show you this again
629.02	in the metaphor of our beloved dog here.
634.42	If we succeed in getting the sausage
634.42	without violating our values,
638.5	then the sausage tastes better.
640.5	That's what our research shows.
642.54	If, on the other hand,
643.82	we do so --
645.1	if we get the sausage
646.54	and in doing so
646.54	we actually violate values,
650.02	we value the sausage less.
653.02	Quantitatively, that's quite powerful.
655.5	We can measure these protected values,
657.98	for example,
659.22	by a survey measure.
662.18	Simple, nine-item survey that's quite
662.18	predictive in these experiments.
668.18	If you think about the average
668.18	of the population
670.54	and then there's
670.54	a distribution around it --
672.66	people are different,
672.66	we all are different.
675.3	People who have a set of protected values
678.3	that's one standard deviation
678.3	above the average,
682.5	they discount money they receive
682.5	by lying by about 25 percent.
687.58	That means a dollar received when lying
691.22	is worth to them only 75 cents
693.38	without any incentives you put in place
693.38	for them to behave honestly.
697.1	It's their intrinsic motivation.
698.86	By the way, I'm not a moral authority.
700.74	I'm not saying I have
700.74	all these beautiful values, right?
704.26	But I'm interested in how people behave
706.22	and how we can leverage
706.22	that richness in human nature
709.62	to actually improve
709.62	the workings of our organizations.
714.22	So there are two
714.22	very, very different visions here.
717.42	On the one hand,
718.78	you can appeal to benefits and costs
721.82	and try to get people
721.82	to behave according to them.
724.5	On the other hand,
726.14	you can select people who have the values
730.18	and the desirable
730.18	characteristics, of course --
732.42	competencies that go
732.42	in line with your organization.
736.02	I do not yet know where
736.02	these protected values really come from.
740.26	Is it nurture or is it nature?
743.66	What I can tell you
745.06	is that the distribution
745.06	looks pretty similar for men and women.
750.18	It looks pretty similar
750.18	for those who had studied economics
753.98	or those who had studied psychology.
757.82	It looks even pretty similar
757.82	around different age categories
761.22	among adults.
762.46	But I don't know yet
762.46	how this develops over a lifetime.
765.14	That will be the subject
765.14	of future research.
769.46	The idea I want to leave you with
771.14	is it's all right to appeal to incentives.
773.94	I'm an economist;
775.18	I certainly believe in the fact
775.18	that incentives work.
779.22	But do think about selecting
779.22	the right people
783.26	rather than having people
783.26	and then putting incentives in place.
786.78	Selecting the right people
786.78	with the right values
789.06	may go a long way
789.06	to saving a lot of trouble
793.02	and a lot of money
794.42	in your organizations.
796.18	In other words,
797.46	it will pay off to put people first.
801.86	Thank you.
803.1	(Applause)
