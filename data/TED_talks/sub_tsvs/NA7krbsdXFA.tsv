12.879	What I'd like to do
12.879	is talk to you a little bit about fear
16.667	and the cost of fear
18.38	and the age of fear
18.38	from which we are now emerging.
22.072	I would like you to feel comfortable
22.072	with my doing that
26.071	by letting you know that I know something
26.071	about fear and anxiety.
31.388	I'm a Jewish guy from New Jersey.
33.599	(Laughter)
35.107	I could worry before I could walk.
37.999	(Laughter)
39.529	Please, applaud that.
41.995	(Applause)
44.407	Thank you.
46.954	But I also grew up in a time
46.954	where there was something to fear.
52.915	We were brought out in the hall
52.915	when I was a little kid
56.2	and taught how to put
56.2	our coats over our heads
59.674	to protect us from global
59.674	thermonuclear war.
63.838	Now even my seven-year-old brain
63.838	knew that wasn't going to work.
69.179	But I also knew
70.361	that global thermonuclear war
70.361	was something to be concerned with.
75.109	And yet, despite the fact
75.109	that we lived for 50 years
79.294	with the threat of such a war,
81.681	the response of our government
81.681	and of our society
85.686	was to do wonderful things.
88.22	We created the space program
88.22	in response to that.
91.242	We built our highway system
91.242	in response to that.
94.363	We created the Internet
94.363	in response to that.
97.934	So sometimes fear can produce
97.934	a constructive response.
102.847	But sometimes it can produce
102.847	an un-constructive response.
107.066	On September 11, 2001,
114.534	and flew them into a couple of buildings.
117.667	They exacted a horrible toll.
120.151	It is not for us to minimize
120.151	what that toll was.
124.965	But the response that we had
124.965	was clearly disproportionate --
131.972	disproportionate to the point
131.972	of verging on the unhinged.
136.874	We rearranged the national security
136.874	apparatus of the United States
140.8	and of many governments
142.664	to address a threat that,
142.664	at the time that those attacks took place,
147.406	was quite limited.
148.733	In fact, according to our
148.733	intelligence services,
152.188	on September 11, 2001,
155.58	there were 100 members of core Al-Qaeda.
159.414	There were just a few thousand terrorists.
162.357	They posed an existential threat
165.495	to no one.
167.561	But we rearranged our entire
167.561	national security apparatus
172.161	in the most sweeping way
172.161	since the end of the Second World War.
176.577	We launched two wars.
178.44	We spent trillions of dollars.
180.797	We suspended our values.
182.998	We violated international law.
184.873	We embraced torture.
186.129	We embraced the idea
187.826	that if these 19 guys could do this,
187.826	anybody could do it.
191.385	And therefore,
191.385	for the first time in history,
194.265	we were seeing everybody as a threat.
197.237	And what was the result of that?
199.113	Surveillance programs that listened in
199.113	on the emails and phone calls
203.145	of entire countries --
205.334	hundreds of millions of people --
207.764	setting aside whether
207.764	those countries were our allies,
210.811	setting aside what our interests were.
214.735	I would argue that 15 years later,
218.037	since today there are more terrorists,
220.454	more terrorist attacks,
220.454	more terrorist casualties --
224.02	this by the count
224.02	of the U.S. State Department --
227.384	since today the region
227.384	from which those attacks emanate
230.477	is more unstable
230.477	than at any time in its history,
234.19	since the Flood, perhaps,
237.894	we have not succeeded in our response.
242.206	Now you have to ask,
242.206	where did we go wrong?
244.237	What did we do?
244.237	What was the mistake that was made?
246.711	And you might say, well look,
246.711	Washington is a dysfunctional place.
250.864	There are political food fights.
252.582	We've turned our discourse
252.582	into a cage match.
256.169	And that's true.
258.039	But there are bigger problems,
258.039	believe it or not, than that dysfunction,
261.477	even though I would argue
263.369	that dysfunction that makes it impossible
263.369	to get anything done
268.044	in the richest and most powerful
268.044	country in the world
271.749	is far more dangerous than anything
271.749	that a group like ISIS could do,
277.422	because it stops us in our tracks
277.422	and it keeps us from progress.
282.183	But there are other problems.
284.127	And the other problems
285.315	came from the fact that in Washington
285.315	and in many capitals right now,
288.895	we're in a creativity crisis.
291.108	In Washington, in think tanks,
293.779	where people are supposed to be
293.779	thinking of new ideas,
296.921	you don't get bold new ideas,
299.011	because if you offer up a bold new idea,
301.902	not only are you attacked on Twitter,
303.778	but you will not get confirmed
303.778	in a government job.
307.153	Because we are reactive to the heightened
307.153	venom of the political debate,
312.406	you get governments that have
312.406	an us-versus-them mentality,
315.54	tiny groups of people making decisions.
317.961	When you sit in a room with a small group
317.961	of people making decisions,
321.267	what do you get?
322.45	You get groupthink.
324.114	Everybody has the same worldview,
325.727	and any view from outside of the group
325.727	is seen as a threat.
329.366	That's a danger.
331.258	You also have processes
331.258	that become reactive to news cycles.
335.543	And so the parts of the U.S. government
335.543	that do foresight, that look forward,
339.86	that do strategy --
341.039	the parts in other governments
341.039	that do this -- can't do it,
343.826	because they're reacting
343.826	to the news cycle.
346.383	And so we're not looking ahead.
348.311	On 9/11, we had a crisis
348.311	because we were looking the wrong way.
352.527	Today we have a crisis because,
352.527	because of 9/11,
355.978	we are still looking
355.978	in the wrong direction,
358.653	and we know because we see
358.653	transformational trends on the horizon
364.525	that are far more important
364.525	than what we saw on 9/11;
369.401	far more important than the threat
369.401	posed by these terrorists;
373.227	far more important even
373.227	than the instability that we've got
376.501	in some areas of the world
376.501	that are racked by instability today.
381.161	In fact, the things that we are seeing
381.161	in those parts of the world
385.845	may be symptoms.
388.883	They may be a reaction to bigger trends.
392.385	And if we are treating the symptom
392.385	and ignoring the bigger trend,
397.113	then we've got far bigger
397.113	problems to deal with.
401.415	And so what are those trends?
403.51	Well, to a group like you,
405.311	the trends are apparent.
408.444	We are living at a moment
408.444	in which the very fabric of human society
413.723	is being rewoven.
417.057	If you saw the cover of The Economist
417.057	a couple of days ago --
420.301	it said that 80 percent
420.301	of the people on the planet,
423.871	by the year 2020, would have a smartphone.
427.564	They would have a small computer
427.564	connected to the Internet in their pocket.
431.808	In most of Africa, the cell phone
431.808	penetration rate is 80 percent.
437.749	We passed the point last October
440.437	when there were more
440.437	mobile cellular devices, SIM cards,
444.432	out in the world than there were people.
447.166	We are within years
447.166	of a profound moment in our history,
453.086	when effectively every single
453.086	human being on the planet
458.467	is going to be part of a man-made
458.467	system for the first time,
463.099	able to touch anyone else --
465.164	touch them for good, touch them for ill.
467.999	And the changes associated with that
467.999	are changing the very nature
473.849	of every aspect of governance
473.849	and life on the planet
477.474	in ways that our leaders
477.474	ought to be thinking about,
480.944	when they're thinking about
480.944	these immediate threats.
483.824	On the security side,
485.614	we've come out of a Cold War in which
485.614	it was too costly to fight a nuclear war,
491.142	and so we didn't,
492.7	to a period that I call
492.7	Cool War, cyber war,
496.541	where the costs of conflict are actually
496.541	so low, that we may never stop.
502.137	We may enter a period of constant warfare,
504.887	and we know this because
504.887	we've been in it for several years.
509.322	And yet, we don't have the basic doctrines
509.322	to guide us in this regard.
515.255	We don't have the basic ideas formulated.
517.37	If someone attacks us with a cyber attack,
519.934	do have the ability to respond
519.934	with a kinetic attack?
523.787	We don't know.
525.573	If somebody launches a cyber attack,
525.573	how do we deter them?
529.682	When China launched
529.682	a series of cyber attacks,
531.893	what did the U.S. government do?
533.444	It said, we're going to indict
533.444	a few of these Chinese guys,
537.453	who are never coming to America.
539.897	They're never going to be anywhere near
539.897	a law enforcement officer
543.87	who's going to take them into custody.
546.252	It's a gesture -- it's not a deterrent.
549.678	Special forces operators
549.678	out there in the field today
553.5	discover that small groups
553.5	of insurgents with cell phones
558.395	have access to satellite imagery
558.395	that once only superpowers had.
563.69	In fact, if you've got a cell phone,
565.881	you've got access to power
565.881	that a superpower didn't have,
569.221	and would have highly
569.221	classified 10 years ago.
571.4	In my cell phone,
571.4	I have an app that tells me
574.315	where every plane in the world is,
574.315	and its altitude, and its speed,
578.879	and what kind of aircraft it is,
580.725	and where it's going
580.725	and where it's landing.
584.429	They have apps that allow them to know
589.002	what their adversary is about to do.
591.245	They're using these tools in new ways.
593.645	When a cafe in Sydney
593.645	was taken over by a terrorist,
597.783	he went in with a rifle...
600.1	and an iPad.
601.936	And the weapon was the iPad.
604.999	Because he captured people,
604.999	he terrorized them,
608.322	he pointed the iPad at them,
611.051	and then he took the video
611.051	and he put it on the Internet,
613.747	and he took over the world's media.
617.861	But it doesn't just affect
617.861	the security side.
622.132	The relations between great powers --
623.985	we thought we were past the bipolar era.
627.259	We thought we were in a unipolar world,
629.157	where all the big issues were resolved.
631.075	Remember? It was the end of history.
634.129	But we're not.
635.449	We're now seeing that our
635.449	basic assumptions about the Internet --
639.861	that it was going to connect us,
639.861	weave society together --
643.946	are not necessarily true.
646.083	In countries like China,
646.083	you have the Great Firewall of China.
649.303	You've got countries saying no,
649.303	if the Internet happens within our borders
652.847	we control it within our borders.
654.446	We control the content.
654.446	We are going to control our security.
657.33	We are going to manage that Internet.
659.12	We are going to say what can be on it.
660.957	We're going to set
660.957	a different set of rules.
663.032	Now you might think,
663.032	well, that's just China.
665.153	But it's not just China.
667.651	It's China, India, Russia.
670.708	It's Saudi Arabia,
670.708	it's Singapore, it's Brazil.
673.832	After the NSA scandal, the Russians,
673.832	the Chinese, the Indians, the Brazilians,
678.37	they said, let's create
678.37	a new Internet backbone,
681.449	because we can't be dependent
681.449	on this other one.
683.955	And so all of a sudden, what do you have?
686.4	You have a new bipolar world
688.923	in which cyber-internationalism,
691.138	our belief,
692.313	is challenged by cyber-nationalism,
695.174	another belief.
697.593	We are seeing these changes
697.593	everywhere we look.
701.629	We are seeing the advent of mobile money.
703.631	It's happening in the places
703.631	you wouldn't expect.
705.952	It's happening in Kenya and Tanzania,
708.353	where millions of people who haven't
708.353	had access to financial services
711.646	now conduct all those
711.646	services on their phones.
714.702	There are 2.5 million people
714.702	who don't have financial service access
719.226	that are going to get it soon.
721.74	A billion of them are going
721.74	to have the ability to access it
724.577	on their cell phone soon.
725.796	It's not just going to give them
725.796	the ability to bank.
728.957	It's going to change
728.957	what monetary policy is.
731.858	It's going to change what money is.
735.262	Education is changing in the same way.
738.43	Healthcare is changing in the same way.
740.915	How government services are delivered
740.915	is changing in the same way.
745.607	And yet, in Washington, we are debating
749.893	whether to call the terrorist group
749.893	that has taken over Syria and Iraq
755.382	ISIS or ISIL or Islamic State.
760.54	We are trying to determine
763.675	how much we want to give
763.675	in a negotiation with the Iranians
768.988	on a nuclear deal which deals
768.988	with the technologies of 50 years ago,
773.811	when in fact, we know that the Iranians
773.811	right now are engaged in cyber war with us
779.193	and we're ignoring it, partially
779.193	because businesses are not willing
785.251	to talk about the attacks
785.251	that are being waged on them.
789.399	And that gets us to another breakdown
792.232	that's crucial,
793.48	and another breakdown that couldn't be
793.48	more important to a group like this,
797.215	because the growth of America
797.215	and real American national security
800.891	and all of the things that drove progress
800.891	even during the Cold War,
805.356	was a public-private partnership
805.356	between science, technology and government
810.131	that began when Thomas Jefferson
810.131	sat alone in his laboratory
813.663	inventing new things.
816.528	But it was the canals
816.528	and railroads and telegraph;
820.362	it was radar and the Internet.
823.129	It was Tang, the breakfast drink --
825.437	probably not the most important
825.437	of those developments.
828.795	But what you had was
828.795	a partnership and a dialogue,
831.698	and the dialogue has broken down.
833.987	It's broken down because in Washington,
836.39	less government is considered more.
838.18	It's broken down because there is,
838.18	believe it or not,
840.683	in Washington, a war on science --
842.547	despite the fact that
842.547	in all of human history,
845.61	every time anyone has waged
845.61	a war on science,
848.594	science has won.
851.463	(Applause)
856.712	But we have a government
856.712	that doesn't want to listen,
860.932	that doesn't have people
860.932	at the highest levels
863.115	that understand this.
864.293	In the nuclear age,
865.468	when there were people
865.468	in senior national security jobs,
868.659	they were expected to speak throw-weight.
872.005	They were expected to know
872.005	the lingo, the vocabulary.
875.047	If you went to the highest level
875.047	of the U.S. government now
877.87	"and said, ""Talk to me about cyber,"
877.87	about neuroscience,
880.427	about the things that are going
880.427	"to change the world of tomorrow,"""
883.591	you'd get a blank stare.
884.766	I know, because when I wrote this book,
886.711	I talked to 150 people,
886.711	many from the science and tech side,
889.775	who felt like they were being
889.775	shunted off to the kids' table.
893.389	Meanwhile, on the tech side,
895.495	we have lots of wonderful people
895.495	creating wonderful things,
899.324	but they started in garages
899.324	and they didn't need the government
902.305	and they don't want the government.
904.002	Many of them have a political view
904.002	that's somewhere between
906.793	libertarian and anarchic:
908.711	leave me alone.
911.305	But the world's coming apart.
913.668	All of a sudden, there are going to be
913.668	massive regulatory changes
917.081	and massive issues
917.081	associated with conflict
920.023	and massive issues associated
920.023	with security and privacy.
924.332	And we haven't even gotten
924.332	to the next set of issues,
926.841	which are philosophical issues.
929.601	If you can't vote,
929.601	if you can't have a job,
932.447	if you can't bank,
932.447	if you can't get health care,
934.963	if you can't be educated
934.963	without Internet access,
937.429	is Internet access a fundamental right
937.429	that should be written into constitutions?
942.364	If Internet access is a fundamental right,
945.559	is electricity access for the 1.2 billion
945.559	who don't have access to electricity
949.741	a fundamental right?
951.5	These are fundamental issues.
951.5	Where are the philosophers?
954.553	Where's the dialogue?
957.59	And that brings me
957.59	to the reason that I'm here.
960.559	I live in Washington. Pity me.
963.101	(Laughter)
964.895	The dialogue isn't happening there.
967.932	These big issues
967.932	that will change the world,
970.351	change national security,
970.351	change economics,
973.023	create hope, create threats,
975.93	can only be resolved
975.93	when you bring together
978.668	groups of people who understand
978.668	science and technology
982.073	back together with government.
983.77	Both sides need each other.
986.486	And until we recreate that connection,
991.262	until we do what helped America grow
991.262	and helped other countries grow,
996.717	then we are going to grow
996.717	ever more vulnerable.
1000.547	The risks associated with 9/11
1000.547	will not be measured
1004.382	in terms of lives lost by terror attacks
1007.412	or buildings destroyed
1007.412	or trillions of dollars spent.
1012.04	They'll be measured in terms of the costs
1012.04	of our distraction from critical issues
1016.967	and our inability to get together
1020.724	scientists, technologists,
1020.724	government leaders,
1024.944	at a moment of transformation
1024.944	akin to the beginning of the Renaissance,
1030.103	akin to the beginning
1030.103	of the major transformational eras
1033.845	that have happened on Earth,
1036.358	and start coming up with,
1036.358	if not the right answers,
1040.828	then at least the right questions.
1043.205	We are not there yet,
1045.272	but discussions like this
1045.272	and groups like you
1048.36	are the places where those questions
1048.36	can be formulated and posed.
1052.553	And that's why I believe
1052.553	that groups like TED,
1057.131	discussions like this around the planet,
1059.748	are the place where the future
1059.748	of foreign policy, of economic policy,
1064.482	of social policy, of philosophy,
1064.482	will ultimately take place.
1070.394	And that's why it's been
1070.394	a pleasure speaking to you.
1072.848	Thank you very, very much.
1074.127	(Applause)
