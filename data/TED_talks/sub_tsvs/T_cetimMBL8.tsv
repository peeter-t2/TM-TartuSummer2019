12.76	The conventional wisdom
12.76	about our world today
15.6	is that this is a time
15.6	of terrible decline.
19.64	And that's not surprising,
19.64	given the bad news all around us,
23.72	from ISIS to inequality,
25.84	political dysfunction, climate change,
28.28	Brexit, and on and on.
31.76	But here's the thing,
31.76	and this may sound a little weird.
35.64	I actually don't buy
35.64	this gloomy narrative,
38.96	and I don't think you should either.
40.76	Look, it's not that
40.76	I don't see the problems.
43.28	I read the same headlines that you do.
46	What I dispute is the conclusion
46	that so many people draw from them,
49.84	namely that we're all screwed
51.76	because the problems are unsolvable
54.88	and our governments are useless.
57.24	Now, why do I say this?
58.64	It's not like I'm particularly
58.64	optimistic by nature.
62.36	But something about the media's
62.36	constant doom-mongering
66.08	with its fixation on problems
66.08	and not on answers
69.8	has always really bugged me.
71.96	So a few years ago I decided,
74.08	well, I'm a journalist,
76	I should see if I can do any better
78	by going around the world
78	and actually asking folks
81.56	if and how they've tackled
82.84	their big economic
82.84	and political challenges.
86.76	And what I found astonished me.
89.28	It turns out that there are remarkable
89.28	signs of progress out there,
93.72	often in the most unexpected places,
96.8	and they've convinced me
96.8	that our great global challenges
100	may not be so unsolvable after all.
103.04	Not only are there theoretical fixes;
105.76	those fixes have been tried.
107.88	They've worked.
109.64	And they offer hope for the rest of us.
112.4	I'm going to show you what I mean
114.04	by telling you about
114.04	how three of the countries I visited --
116.92	Canada, Indonesia and Mexico --
118.56	overcame three supposedly
118.56	impossible problems.
122.72	Their stories matter because they contain
122.72	tools the rest of us can use,
126.84	and not just for those
126.84	particular problems,
129.8	but for many others, too.
133.12	When most people think
133.12	about my homeland, Canada, today,
137.36	if they think about Canada at all,
139.004	they think cold, they think boring,
139.004	they think polite.
142.639	"They think we say ""sorry"" too much"
142.639	in our funny accents.
146.8	And that's all true.
148.04	(Laughter)
149.6	Sorry.
150.84	(Laughter)
152.36	But Canada's also important
155.24	because of its triumph over a problem
157.08	currently tearing
157.08	many other countries apart:
159.76	immigration.
161.08	Consider, Canada today is among
161.08	the world's most welcoming nations,
165.52	even compared to other
165.52	immigration-friendly countries.
169.2	Its per capita immigration rate
169.2	is four times higher than France's,
173.96	and its percentage
173.96	of foreign-born residents
176.16	is double that of Sweden.
178.08	Meanwhile, Canada admitted
	in the last year
183.6	than did the United States.
185.32	(Applause)
192.48	And now Canada is taking even more.
194.96	And yet, if you ask Canadians
196.84	what makes them proudest of their country,
199.52	"they rank ""multiculturalism,"""
202	a dirty word in most places,
204.24	second,
205.48	ahead of hockey.
207.72	Hockey.
208.96	(Laughter)
211.96	In other words,
211.96	at a time when other countries
214.16	are now frantically building
214.16	new barriers to keep foreigners out,
217.44	Canadians want even more of them in.
221.32	Now, here's the really interesting part.
223.52	Canada wasn't always like this.
225.96	Until the mid-1960s, Canada followed
225.96	an explicitly racist immigration policy.
232.48	"They called it ""White Canada,"""
234.8	and as you can see, they were not
234.8	just talking about the snow.
239.48	So how did that Canada
239.48	become today's Canada?
245.32	Well, despite what my mom
245.32	in Ontario will tell you,
247.76	the answer had nothing to do with virtue.
249.76	Canadians are not inherently
249.76	better than anyone else.
253.16	The real explanation involves the man
253.16	who became Canada's leader in 1968,
257.84	Pierre Trudeau, who is also
257.84	the father of the current prime minister.
261.12	(Applause)
265	The thing to know about that first Trudeau
267.04	is that he was very different
267.04	from Canada's previous leaders.
269.959	He was a French speaker in a country
269.959	long-dominated by its English elite.
274.48	He was an intellectual.
276.08	He was even kind of groovy.
278.88	I mean, seriously, the guy did yoga.
281.56	He hung out with the Beatles.
282.965	(Laughter)
284.08	And like all hipsters,
284.08	he could be infuriating at times.
288.68	But he nevertheless pulled off
290.44	one of the most progressive
290.44	transformations any country has ever seen.
296.36	His formula, I've learned,
296.36	involved two parts.
298.72	First, Canada threw out
298.72	its old race-based immigration rules,
302.72	and it replaced them
302.72	with new color-blind ones
305.56	that emphasized education,
305.56	experience and language skills instead.
310.76	And what that did
310.76	was greatly increase the odds
313.28	that newcomers would
313.28	contribute to the economy.
316.68	Then part two, Trudeau
316.68	created the world's first policy
320.24	of official multiculturalism
320.24	to promote integration
324.44	and the idea that diversity
324.44	was the key to Canada's identity.
329.56	Now, in the years that followed,
329.56	Ottawa kept pushing this message,
333.04	but at the same time, ordinary Canadians
335.84	soon started to see the economic,
335.84	the material benefits of multiculturalism
340.36	all around them.
341.64	And these two influences soon combined
344.28	to create the passionately
344.28	open-minded Canada of today.
349.68	Let's now turn to another country
349.68	and an even tougher problem,
353.16	Islamic extremism.
355.44	In 1998, the people of Indonesia
355.44	took to the streets
358.72	and overthrew
358.72	their longtime dictator, Suharto.
362.36	It was an amazing moment,
364.64	but it was also a scary one.
366.4	With 250 million people,
368.12	Indonesia is the largest
368.12	Muslim-majority country on Earth.
372.24	It's also hot, huge and unruly,
375.24	made up of 17,000 islands,
377.56	where people speak
377.56	close to a thousand languages.
380.64	Now, Suharto had been a dictator,
383.2	and a nasty one.
384.84	But he'd also been
384.84	a pretty effective tyrant,
387.96	and he'd always been careful
387.96	to keep religion out of politics.
391.28	So experts feared that without
391.28	him keeping a lid on things,
394.88	the country would explode,
396.64	or religious extremists would take over
398.56	and turn Indonesia
398.56	into a tropical version of Iran.
403.6	And that's just what seemed
403.6	to happen at first.
406.36	In the country's
406.36	first free elections, in 1999,
409.48	Islamist parties scored
412.88	and the islands burned
414.56	as riots and terror attacks
414.56	killed thousands.
418.64	Since then, however,
418.64	Indonesia has taken a surprising turn.
423.92	While ordinary folks have grown
423.92	more pious on a personal level --
427.52	I saw a lot more headscarves
427.52	on a recent visit
429.72	than I would have a decade ago --
431.68	the country's politics
431.68	have moved in the opposite direction.
435.96	Indonesia is now
435.96	a pretty decent democracy.
440.32	And yet, its Islamist parties
440.32	have steadily lost support,
443.28	from a high of about 38 percent in 2004
446.64	down to 25 percent in 2014.
450.6	As for terrorism, it's now extremely rare.
454.04	And while a few Indonesians
454.04	have recently joined ISIS,
457.44	their number is tiny,
459.84	far fewer in per capita terms
462.84	than the number of Belgians.
466.28	Try to think of one other
466.28	Muslim-majority country
468.76	that can say all those same things.
471.2	In 2014, I went to Indonesia
471.2	to ask its current president,
474.12	a soft-spoken technocrat
474.12	named Joko Widodo,
477.72	"""Why is Indonesia thriving when"
477.72	"so many other Muslim states are dying?"""
483.12	"""Well, what we realized,"" he told me,"
484.96	"""is that to deal with extremism,"
484.96	"we needed to deal with inequality first."""
489.84	See, Indonesia's religious parties,
489.84	like similar parties elsewhere,
493.4	had tended to focus on things like
493.4	reducing poverty and cutting corruption.
498.04	So that's what Joko
498.04	and his predecessors did too,
500.64	thereby stealing the Islamists' thunder.
503.48	They also cracked down hard on terrorism,
506.12	but Indonesia's democrats
506.12	have learned a key lesson
508.72	from the dark years of dictatorship,
510.68	namely that repression
510.68	only creates more extremism.
516.08	So they waged their war
516.08	with extraordinary delicacy.
520	They used the police instead of the army.
522.08	They only detained suspects
522.08	if they had enough evidence.
525.12	They held public trials.
526.72	They even sent
526.72	liberal imams into the jails
529.44	to persuade the jihadists
529.44	that terror is un-Islamic.
532.76	And all of this paid off
532.76	in spectacular fashion,
535.88	creating the kind of country
535.88	that was unimaginable 20 years ago.
540.6	So at this point,
540.6	my optimism should, I hope,
543.72	be starting to make a bit more sense.
545.56	Neither immigration nor Islamic extremism
545.56	are impossible to deal with.
550.44	Join me now on one last trip,
552.52	this time to Mexico.
554.96	Now, of our three stories,
554.96	this one probably surprised me the most,
558.16	since as you all know,
559.6	the country is still struggling
559.6	with so many problems.
562.72	And yet, a few years ago,
562.72	Mexico did something
565.4	that many other countries
565.4	from France to India to the United States
570.56	can still only dream of.
572.48	It shattered the political paralysis
572.48	that had gripped it for years.
577.2	To understand how,
577.2	we need to rewind to the year 2000,
580.2	when Mexico finally became a democracy.
582.8	Rather than use their new freedoms
582.8	to fight for reform,
587	Mexico's politicians used them
587	to fight one another.
590.36	Congress deadlocked,
590.36	and the country's problems --
593.32	drugs, poverty, crime, corruption --
596.4	spun out of control.
598	Things got so bad that in 2008,
600.64	the Pentagon warned
600.64	that Mexico risked collapse.
604.68	Then in 2012, this guy
604.68	named Enrique Peña Nieto
609.08	somehow got himself elected president.
611.6	Now, this Peña hardly inspired
611.6	much confidence at first.
616.68	Sure, he was handsome,
618.96	but he came from Mexico's
618.96	corrupt old ruling party, the PRI,
622.88	and he was a notorious womanizer.
626.52	In fact, he seemed
626.52	like such a pretty boy lightweight
629.6	"that women called him ""bombón,"" sweetie,"
632.4	at campaign rallies.
635.36	And yet this same bombón
635.36	soon surprised everyone
639	by hammering out a truce
640.28	between the country's
640.28	three warring political parties.
643.32	And over the next 18 months,
643.32	they together passed
645.92	an incredibly comprehensive
645.92	set of reforms.
648.88	They busted open Mexico's
648.88	smothering monopolies.
651.96	They liberalized
651.96	its rusting energy sector.
655.2	They restructured
655.2	its failing schools, and much more.
658.44	To appreciate the scale
658.44	of this accomplishment,
660.68	try to imagine the US Congress
660.68	passing immigration reform,
664.92	campaign finance reform
664.92	and banking reform.
667.88	Now, try to imagine Congress
667.88	doing it all at the same time.
671.92	That's what Mexico did.
674.16	Not long ago, I met with Peña
674.16	and asked how he managed it all.
678.32	The President flashed me
678.32	his famous twinkly smile --
681.44	(Laughter)
684.64	and told me that the short answer
684.64	"was ""compromiso,"" compromise."
689.6	Of course, I pushed him for details,
691.36	and the long answer
691.36	that came out was essentially
693.92	"""compromise, compromise"
693.92	"and more compromise."""
697.28	See, Peña knew that he needed
697.28	to build trust early,
700.08	so he started talking to the opposition
700.08	just days after his election.
703.88	To ward off pressure
703.88	from special interests,
706.24	he kept their meetings small and secret,
709.04	and many of the participants
709.04	later told me that it was this intimacy,
713.36	plus a lot of shared tequila,
715.04	that helped build confidence.
717.6	So did the fact that all decisions
717.6	had to be unanimous,
720.48	and that Peña even agreed to pass
720.48	some of the other party's priorities
724.64	before his own.
726.8	As Santiago Creel,
726.8	an opposition senator, put it to me,
729.88	"""Look, I'm not saying that I'm special"
729.88	or that anyone is special,
734.56	"but that group, that was special."""
738.04	The proof?
739.28	When Peña was sworn in, the pact held,
742.64	and Mexico moved forward
742.64	for the first time in years.
747.52	Bueno.
748.76	So now we've seen
748.76	how these three countries
751.08	overcame three of their great challenges.
753.64	And that's very nice for them, right?
755.48	But what good does it do the rest of us?
759	Well, in the course of studying these
759	and a bunch of other success stories,
762.6	like the way Rwanda pulled itself
762.6	back together after civil war
766.76	or Brazil has reduced inequality,
769.52	or South Korea has kept its economy
769.52	growing faster and for longer
773.28	than any other country on Earth,
775.24	I've noticed a few common threads.
777.72	Now, before describing them,
777.72	I need to add a caveat.
780.84	I realize, of course,
780.84	that all countries are unique.
783.48	So you can't simply
783.48	take what worked in one,
786.2	port it to another
786.2	and expect it to work there too.
788.92	Nor do specific solutions work forever.
791.28	You've got to adapt them
791.28	as circumstances change.
794.88	That said, by stripping
794.88	these stories to their essence,
798.52	you absolutely can distill
798.52	a few common tools for problem-solving
803.2	that will work in other countries
806.16	and in boardrooms
807.48	and in all sorts of other contexts, too.
810.64	Number one, embrace the extreme.
813.96	In all the stories we've just looked at,
815.92	salvation came at a moment
815.92	of existential peril.
819.76	And that was no coincidence.
821.64	Take Canada: when Trudeau took office,
821.64	he faced two looming dangers.
826.64	First, though his vast,
826.64	underpopulated country
829.32	badly needed more bodies,
830.96	its preferred source
830.96	for white workers, Europe,
833.6	had just stopped exporting them
833.6	as it finally recovered from World War II.
837.68	The other problem was
837.68	that Canada's long cold war
840.2	between its French
840.2	and its English communities
843.04	had just become a hot one.
845.28	Quebec was threatening to secede,
847.48	and Canadians were actually
847.48	killing other Canadians over politics.
851.28	Now, countries face
851.28	crises all the time. Right?
854.76	That's nothing special.
856.96	But Trudeau's genius
856.96	was to realize that Canada's crisis
860.76	had swept away all the hurdles
860.76	that usually block reform.
864.88	Canada had to open up. It had no choice.
869	And it had to rethink its identity.
870.84	Again, it had no choice.
872.56	And that gave Trudeau
872.56	a once-in-a-generation opportunity
876.12	to break the old rules and write new ones.
879.36	And like all our other heroes,
879.36	he was smart enough to seize it.
884.36	Number two, there's power
884.36	in promiscuous thinking.
888.2	Another striking similarity
888.2	among good problem-solvers
891.16	is that they're all pragmatists.
893.2	They'll steal the best answers
893.2	from wherever they find them,
896.4	and they don't let details
897.8	like party or ideology
897.8	or sentimentality get in their way.
903.16	As I mentioned earlier,
903.16	Indonesia's democrats were clever enough
906.48	to steal many of the Islamists'
906.48	best campaign promises for themselves.
911.28	They even invited some of the radicals
911.28	into their governing coalition.
915.2	Now, that horrified
915.2	a lot of secular Indonesians.
919.84	But by forcing the radicals
919.84	to actually help govern,
924.72	it quickly exposed the fact
924.72	that they weren't any good at the job,
928.6	and it got them mixed up
928.6	in all of the grubby compromises
931.64	and petty humiliations
931.64	that are part of everyday politics.
934.72	And that hurt their image so badly
934.72	that they've never recovered.
939.24	Number three,
940.64	please all of the people some of the time.
944.2	I know I just mentioned how crises
944.2	can grant leaders extraordinary freedoms.
949.32	And that's true, but problem-solving
949.32	often requires more than just boldness.
953.32	It takes showing restraint, too,
955.92	just when that's
955.92	the last thing you want to do.
958.6	Take Trudeau: when he took office,
960.56	he could easily have put
960.56	his core constituency,
963.16	that is Canada's French community, first.
965.84	He could have pleased
965.84	some of the people all of the time.
969.92	And Peña could have used his power
969.92	to keep attacking the opposition,
973.48	as was traditional in Mexico.
975.28	Yet he chose to embrace
975.28	his enemies instead,
978.44	while forcing his own party to compromise.
980.96	And Trudeau pushed everyone
980.96	to stop thinking in tribal terms
985.16	and to see multiculturalism,
985.16	not language and not skin color,
989.68	as what made them
989.68	quintessentially Canadian.
992.96	Nobody got everything they wanted,
995.48	but everyone got just enough
995.48	that the bargains held.
1000.56	So at this point you may be thinking,
1003	"""OK, Tepperman,"
1004.24	if the fixes really are out there
1004.24	like you keep insisting,
1007	then why aren't more countries
1007	"already using them?"""
1010.64	It's not like they require
1010.64	special powers to pull off.
1013.24	I mean, none of the leaders
1013.24	we've just looked at were superheroes.
1016.84	They didn't accomplish
1016.84	anything on their own,
1019	and they all had plenty of flaws.
1021.2	Take Indonesia's
1021.2	first democratic president,
1023.64	Abdurrahman Wahid.
1025.32	This man was so powerfully uncharismatic
1028.56	that he once fell asleep
1030.68	in the middle of his own speech.
1032.48	(Laughter)
1034.12	True story.
1039.96	So what this tells us
1039.96	is that the real obstacle is not ability,
1043.68	and it's not circumstances.
1045.52	It's something much simpler.
1047.599	Making big changes
1047.599	involves taking big risks,
1051.599	and taking big risks is scary.
1054.48	Overcoming that fear requires guts,
1057.839	and as you all know,
1059.2	gutsy politicians are painfully rare.
1063.12	But that doesn't mean we voters
1065.24	can't demand courage
1065.24	from our political leaders.
1068	I mean, that's why we put them
1068	in office in the first place.
1071.52	And given the state of the world today,
1071.52	there's really no other option.
1075.88	The answers are out there,
1078.72	but now it's up to us
1081.08	to elect more women and men
1083.64	brave enough to find them,
1086.04	to steal them
1087.44	and to make them work.
1089.08	Thank you.
1090.48	(Applause)
