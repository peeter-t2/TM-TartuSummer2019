16.244	Shall I ask for a show
16.244	of hands or a clapping
21.404	of people in different generations?
23.528	I'm interested in how many
23.528	are three to 12 years old.
27.26	(Laughter)
32.534	None, huh?
33.844	(Laughter)
35.243	All right.
37.069	I'm going to talk about dinosaurs.
38.851	Do you remember dinosaurs
38.851	when you were that age?
41.26	(Applause)
48.855	Dinosaurs are kind of funny, you know.
51.26	(Laughter)
53.781	We're going to kind of go
53.781	in a different direction right now.
56.714	I hope you all realize that.
58.814	So I'll just give you my message up front:
61.615	Try not to go extinct.
63.254	(Laughter)
64.616	That's it.
65.826	(Laughter)
71.179	People ask me a lot --
73.274	in fact, one of the most asked
73.274	questions I get
75.95	is, why do children
75.95	like dinosaurs so much?
79.26	What's the fascination?
81.741	And I usually just say,
84.26	"""Well, dinosaurs were big,"
87.091	"different and gone."""
90.456	They're all gone.
91.778	Well that's not true,
93.848	but we'll get to the goose in a minute.
96.007	So that's sort of the theme:
98.528	big, different and gone.
102.404	The title of my talk:
104.093	Shape-shifting Dinosaurs:
106.159	The cause of a premature extinction.
109.265	Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs.
112.078	And there's lots of different shapes.
115.005	Lots of different kinds.
117.482	A long time ago,
119.95	back in the early 1900s,
119.95	museums were out looking for dinosaurs.
125.122	They went out and gathered them up.
127.861	And this is an interesting story.
130.463	Every museum wanted a little bigger
130.463	or better one than anybody else had.
134.518	So if the museum in Toronto went out
134.518	and collected a Tyrannosaur, a big one,
141.33	then the museum in Ottawa
141.33	wanted a bigger one, and a better one.
146.052	And that happened for all museums.
147.904	So everyone was out looking
147.904	for all these bigger and better dinosaurs.
153.161	And this was in the early 1900s.
156.406	By about 1970,
160.121	some scientists were sitting around
160.121	"and they thought, ""What in the world --"
164.975	Look at these dinosaurs, they're all big.
169.012	"Where are all the little ones?"""
171.006	(Laughter)
173.834	And they thought about it
173.834	and they even wrote papers about it:
177.374	"""Where are the little dinosaurs?"""
179.26	(Laughter)
188.159	Well, go to a museum, you'll see,
191.8	see how many baby dinosaurs there are.
194.922	People assumed --
194.922	and this was actually a problem --
197.733	people assumed
197.733	that if they had little dinosaurs,
202.061	if they had juvenile dinosaurs,
202.061	they'd be easy to identify.
205.787	You'd have a big dinosaur
205.787	and a littler dinosaur.
209.684	(Laughter)
211.126	But all they had were big dinosaurs.
214.243	And it comes down to a couple of things.
216.26	First off, scientists have egos,
221.038	and scientists like to name dinosaurs.
224.915	They like to name anything.
226.26	Everybody likes to have
226.26	their own animal that they named.
230.241	(Laughter)
233.242	And so every time they found something
233.242	that looked a little different,
236.573	they named it something different.
238.928	And what happened, of course,
240.354	is we ended up with a whole
240.354	bunch of different dinosaurs.
245.902	In 1975,
249.556	a light went on in somebody's head.
252.089	Dr. Peter Dodson
252.089	at the University of Pennsylvania
256.338	actually realized that dinosaurs
256.338	grew kind of like birds do,
263.928	which is different
263.928	than the way reptiles grow.
267.506	And in fact,
269.11	he used the cassowary as an example.
272.65	And it's kind of cool --
272.65	if you look at the cassowary,
275.725	or any of the birds
275.725	that have crests on their heads,
278.976	they grow to about 80 percent adult size
278.976	before the crest starts to grow.
286.694	Now think about that.
288.26	They're basically retaining
288.26	their juvenile characteristics
291.26	very late in what we call ontogeny.
294.804	So allometric cranial ontogeny
294.804	is relative skull growth.
301.26	So you can see that if you actually found
301.26	one that was 80 percent grown
308.721	and you didn't know that it was going
308.721	to grow up to a cassowary,
312.17	you would think
312.17	they were two different animals.
315.43	So this was a problem,
318.26	and Peter Dodson pointed this out
318.26	using some duck-billed dinosaurs
324.322	then called Hypacrosaurus.
325.847	And he showed that if you were to take
325.847	a baby and an adult
330.737	and make an average
330.737	of what it should look like,
334.062	if it grew in sort of a linear fashion,
337.313	it would have a crest
337.313	about half the size of the adult.
341.496	But the actual subadult at 65 percent
341.496	had no crest at all.
347.581	So this was interesting.
349.26	So this is where people went astray again.
355.371	I mean, if they'd have just taken that,
358.002	taken Peter Dodson's work,
358.002	and gone on with that,
361.044	then we would have a lot less
361.044	dinosaurs than we have.
364.918	But scientists have egos;
364.918	they like to name things.
369.38	And so they went on naming dinosaurs
369.38	because they were different.
375.405	Now we have a way of actually testing
378.082	to see whether a dinosaur, or any animal,
378.082	is a young one or an older one.
383.401	And that's by actually
383.401	cutting into their bones.
387.149	But cutting into the bones of a dinosaur
387.149	is hard to do, as you can imagine,
393.947	because in museums, bones are precious.
401.102	You go into a museum,
401.102	and they take really good care of them.
403.984	They put them in foam, little containers.
407.6	They're very well taken care of.
411.432	They don't like it if you come in
411.432	and want to saw them open and look inside.
415.37	(Laughter)
416.395	So they don't normally let you do that.
419.828	(Laughter)
420.853	But I have a museum
420.853	and I collect dinosaurs
425.387	and I can saw mine open.
427.275	So that's what I do.
429.276	(Applause)
435.965	So if you cut open a little dinosaur,
438.646	it's very spongy inside, like A.
441.36	And if you cut into an older dinosaur,
441.36	it's very massive.
444.26	You can tell it's mature bone.
447.361	So it's real easy to tell them apart.
449.864	So what I want to do is show you these.
453.593	In North America in the northern plains
453.593	of the United States
457.518	and the southern plains
457.518	of Alberta and Saskatchewan,
461.26	there's this unit of rock
461.26	called the Hell Creek Formation
465.01	that produces the last
465.01	dinosaurs that lived on Earth.
468.485	And there are 12 of them
468.485	that everyone recognizes --
471.433	I mean the 12 primary dinosaurs
471.433	that went extinct.
475.873	And so we will evaluate them.
479.399	And that's sort of what I've been doing.
481.379	So my students, my staff,
481.379	we've been cutting them open.
487.074	Now as you can imagine,
487.074	cutting open a leg bone is one thing,
490.941	but when you go to a museum
494.024	"and say, ""You don't mind if I cut open"
494.024	"your dinosaur's skull, do you?"""
498.714	"they say, ""Go away."""
501.26	(Laughter)
508.808	So here are 12 dinosaurs.
510.26	And we want to look at these three first.
514.005	So these are dinosaurs
514.005	that are called Pachycephalosaurus.
517.403	And everybody knows
517.403	that these three animals are related.
521.057	And the assumption is that they're related
521.057	like cousins or whatever.
527.382	But no one ever considered
527.382	that they might be more closely related.
533.242	In other words,
534.49	people looked at them
534.49	and they saw the differences.
537.845	And you all know
537.845	that if you are going to determine
541.26	whether you're related
541.26	to your brother or your sister,
544.19	you can't do it by looking at differences.
547.95	You can only determine relatedness
547.95	by looking for similarities.
551.475	So people were looking at these
553.498	and they were talking
553.498	about how different they are.
555.955	Pachycephalosaurus has a big,
555.955	thick dome on its head,
559.403	and it's got some little bumps
559.403	on the back of its head,
562.124	and it's got a bunch of gnarly things
562.124	on the end of its nose.
566.05	And then Stygimoloch, another dinosaur
566.05	from the same age, lived at the same time,
571.83	has spikes sticking out
571.83	the back of its head.
574.02	It's got a little, tiny dome,
576.016	and it's got a bunch
576.016	of gnarly stuff on its nose.
579.549	And then there's this thing
579.549	called Dracorex hogwartsia.
584.487	Guess where that came from?
585.941	Dragon.
587.129	So here's a dinosaur that has spikes
587.129	sticking out of its head,
590.905	no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose.
594.744	Nobody noticed the gnarly stuff
594.744	sort of looked alike.
598.362	But they did look at these three
599.985	"and they said, ""These"
599.985	are three different dinosaurs,
602.464	and Dracorex is probably
602.464	the most primitive of them.
605.402	And the other one
605.402	"is more primitive than the other."""
609.416	It's unclear to me how they actually
609.416	sorted these three of them out.
613.541	But if you line them up,
615.458	if you just take those three skulls
615.458	and just line them up,
618.537	they line up like this.
620.548	Dracorex is the littlest one,
622.628	Stygimoloch is the middle-size one,
625.261	Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one.
627.26	And one would think,
627.26	that should give me a clue.
631.26	(Laughter)
633.613	But it didn't give them a clue.
635.167	(Laughter)
636.365	Because, well we know why.
639.464	Scientists like to name things.
643.928	So if we cut open Dracorex --
646.688	I cut open our Dracorex --
648.637	and look, it was spongy inside,
648.637	really spongy inside.
652.885	I mean, it is a juvenile
652.885	and it's growing really fast.
657.164	So it is going to get bigger.
659.175	If you cut open Stygimoloch,
659.175	it is doing the same thing.
662.837	The dome, that little dome,
662.837	is growing really fast.
666.491	It's inflating very fast.
668.824	What's interesting is the spike
668.824	on the back of the Dracorex
672.224	was growing very fast as well.
674.327	The spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch
674.327	are actually resorbing,
677.6	which means they're getting smaller
677.6	as that dome is getting bigger.
681.758	And if we look at Pachycephalosaurus,
684.26	Pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome
687.535	and its little bumps on the back
687.535	of its head were also resorbing.
692.527	So just with these three dinosaurs,
696.26	as a scientist, we can easily hypothesize
698.98	that it is just a growth series
698.98	of the same animal.
704.459	Which of course means
708.222	that Stygimoloch and Dracorex are extinct.
712.965	(Laughter)
717.953	OK.
719.314	(Laughter)
722.207	Which of course means
722.207	we have 10 primary dinosaurs to deal with.
728.494	So a colleague of mine at Berkeley --
728.494	he and I were looking at Triceratops.
733.455	And before the year 2000 --
735.794	now remember, Triceratops was first
735.794	found in the 1800s --
739.49	before 2000, no one had ever seen
739.49	a juvenile Triceratops.
745.622	There's a Triceratops
745.622	in every museum in the world,
749.19	but no one had ever collected a juvenile.
753.678	And we know why, right?
755.104	Because everybody wants to have a big one.
758.104	So everyone had a big one.
760.162	So we went out and collected
760.162	a whole bunch of stuff
762.594	and we found a whole bunch of little ones.
764.625	They're everywhere,
764.625	they're all over the place.
767.844	So we have a whole bunch
767.844	of them at our museum.
770.133	(Laughter)
774.607	And everybody says
774.607	it's because I have a little museum.
777.295	When you have a little museum,
777.295	you have little dinosaurs.
780.039	(Laughter)
783.149	If you look at the Triceratops,
784.915	you can see it's changing,
784.915	it's shape-shifting.
787.584	As the juveniles are growing up,
787.584	their horns actually curve backwards.
791.496	And then as they get older,
791.496	the horns grow forward.
795.185	And that's pretty cool.
796.588	If you look along the edge of the frill,
798.927	they have these little triangular bones
798.927	that actually grow big as triangles
804.117	and then they flatten against the frill
806.845	pretty much like the spikes do
806.845	on the Pachycephalosaurs.
811.078	And then, because the juveniles
811.078	are in my collection,
815.583	I cut them open ...
817.087	(Laughter)
818.262	and look inside.
819.46	And the little one is really spongy.
822.629	And the middle-size one is really spongy.
825.027	But what was interesting
825.027	was the adult Triceratops was also spongy.
829.926	And this is a skull
829.926	that is two meters long.
833.373	It's a big skull.
836.088	But there's another dinosaur
836.088	that is found in this formation
840.879	that looks like a Triceratops,
840.879	except it's bigger,
844.386	and it's called Torosaurus.
847.215	And Torosaurus, when we cut
847.215	into it, has mature bone.
851.697	But it's got these big
851.697	holes in its shield.
853.763	And everybody says,
854.94	"""A Triceratops and a Torosaurus"
854.94	can't possibly be the same animal
858.624	because one of them's bigger
858.624	"than the other one."""
861.14	(Laughter)
865.799	"""And it has holes in its frill."""
868.296	"And I said, ""Well do we have"
868.296	"any juvenile Torosauruses?"""
871.279	"And they said, ""Well, no,"
871.279	"but it has holes in its frill."""
876.723	So one of my graduate
876.723	students, John Scannella,
880.199	looked through our whole collection
881.942	and he actually discovered that the hole
881.942	starting to form in Triceratops
888.082	and, of course it's open, in Torosaurus --
891.241	so he found the transitional ones
891.241	between Triceratops and Torosaurus,
896.403	which was pretty cool.
897.659	So now we know that Torosaurus
897.659	is actually a grown-up Triceratops.
905.224	Now when we name dinosaurs,
907.028	when we name anything,
907.028	the original name gets to stick
910.588	and the second name is thrown out.
915.196	So Torosaurus is extinct.
918.701	Triceratops, if you've heard the news,
918.701	a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong.
922.543	They thought Torosaurus should be kept
922.543	and Triceratops thrown out,
926.117	but that's not going to happen.
927.925	(Laughter)
933.439	All right, so we can do this
933.439	with a bunch of dinosaurs.
936.746	I mean, here's Edmontosaurus
938.816	and Anatotitan.
940.683	Anatotitan: giant duck.
943.892	It's a giant duck-bill dinosaur.
946.067	Here's another one.
947.819	So we look at the bone histology.
950.316	The bone histology tells us
950.316	that Edmontosaurus is a juvenile,
955.223	or at least a subadult,
956.875	and the other one is an adult,
956.875	and we have an ontogeny.
963.533	And we get rid of Anatotitan.
966.66	So we can just keep doing this.
968.505	And the last one is T. Rex.
972.592	So there's these two dinosaurs,
972.592	T. Rex and Nanotyrannus.
977.26	(Laughter)
980.174	Again, it makes you wonder.
982.914	(Laughter)
986.148	But they had a good question.
988.507	They were looking at them and they said,
988.507	"""One's got 17 teeth,"
991.416	and the biggest one's got 12 teeth.
993.304	And that doesn't make any sense at all,
995.198	because we don't know of any dinosaurs
995.198	that gain teeth as they get older.
998.89	So it must be true --
1001.162	"they must be different."""
1003.903	So we cut into them.
1006.633	And sure enough,
1006.633	Nanotyrannus has juvenile bone
1010.534	and the bigger one has more mature bone.
1014.699	It looks like it could still get bigger.
1017.126	And at the Museum
1017.126	of the Rockies where we work,
1019.371	I have four T. rexes,
1019.371	so I can cut a whole bunch of them.
1023.034	But I didn't have to cut
1023.034	any of them really,
1025.26	because I just lined up their jaws
1028.26	and it turned out
1028.26	the biggest one had 12 teeth
1031.594	and the next smallest one had 13
1033.793	and the next smallest had 14.
1036.047	And of course, Nano has 17.
1038.094	And we just went out and looked
1038.094	at other people's collections
1041.005	and we found one that has
1041.005	sort of 15 teeth.
1044.764	So again, real easy to say
1047.566	that Tyrannosaurus ontogeny
1047.566	included Nanotyrannus,
1052.946	and therefore we can take out
1052.946	another dinosaur.
1057.609	(Laughter)
1062.637	So when it comes down
1062.637	to our end Cretaceous,
1065.954	we have seven left.
1069.359	And that's a good number.
1071.016	That's a good number
1071.016	to go extinct, I think.
1074.864	Now as you can imagine,
1076.122	this is not very popular
1076.122	with fourth-graders.
