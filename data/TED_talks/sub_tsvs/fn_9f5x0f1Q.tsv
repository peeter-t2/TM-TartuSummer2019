15.704	I think I'll start out
15.704	and just talk a little bit
18.174	about what exactly autism is.
19.689	Autism is a very big continuum
22.348	that goes from very severe --
22.348	the child remains nonverbal --
25.546	all the way up to brilliant
25.546	scientists and engineers.
28.26	And I actually feel at home here,
30.261	because there's a lot
30.261	of autism genetics here.
32.831	(Laughter)
33.887	You wouldn't have any --
35.069	(Applause)
38.062	It's a continuum of traits.
40.122	When does a nerd turn into Asperger,
40.122	which is just mild autism?
45.803	I mean, Einstein and Mozart and Tesla
45.803	would all be probably diagnosed
50.985	as autistic spectrum today.
52.901	And one of the things
52.901	that is really going to concern me
56.216	is getting these kids to be the ones
58.475	that are going to invent
58.475	the next energy things
61.321	that Bill Gates talked about this morning.
64.058	OK, now, if you want
64.058	to understand autism: animals.
67.995	I want to talk to you now
67.995	about different ways of thinking.
70.909	You have to get away from verbal language.
73.783	I think in pictures.
73.783	I don't think in language.
78.082	Now, the thing about the autistic mind
78.082	is it attends to details.
83.376	This is a test where you either
83.376	have to pick out the big letters
86.455	or the little letters,
87.702	and the autistic mind picks out
87.702	the little letters more quickly.
91.947	And the thing is, the normal brain
91.947	ignores the details.
95.722	Well, if you're building a bridge,
95.722	details are pretty important
98.756	because it'll fall down
98.756	if you ignore the details.
101.178	And one of my big concerns
101.178	with a lot of policy things today
104.069	is things are getting too abstract.
105.771	People are getting away
105.771	from doing hands-on stuff.
109.022	I'm really concerned
109.022	that a lot of the schools
111.206	have taken out the hands-on classes,
111.206	because art, and classes like that --
115.198	those are the classes where I excelled.
117.535	In my work with cattle,
119.713	I noticed a lot of little things
119.713	that most people don't notice
122.715	would make the cattle balk.
124.027	For example, this flag waving
124.027	right in front of the veterinary facility.
127.598	This feed yard was going to tear down
127.598	their whole veterinary facility;
130.949	all they needed to do was move the flag.
132.887	Rapid movement, contrast.
134.979	In the early '70s when I started,
134.979	I got right down in the chutes
138.037	to see what cattle were seeing.
139.56	People thought that was crazy.
141.046	A coat on a fence would make them balk,
141.046	shadows would make them balk,
144.352	a hose on the floor --
144.352	people weren't noticing these things.
147.44	A chain hanging down ...
148.98	And that's shown
148.98	very, very nicely in the movie.
151.26	In fact, I loved the movie,
151.26	how they duplicated all my projects.
154.739	That's the geek side.
156.104	My drawings got to star in the movie, too.
158.548	And, actually, it's called
158.548	"""Temple Grandin,"""
160.682	"not ""Thinking in Pictures."""
162.03	So what is thinking in pictures?
163.619	It's literally movies in your head.
166.322	My mind works like Google for images.
169.228	When I was a young kid,
169.228	I didn't know my thinking was different.
172.296	I thought everybody thought in pictures.
174.239	Then when I did my book,
174.239	"""Thinking in Pictures,"""
176.518	I started interviewing people
176.518	about how they think.
178.954	And I was shocked to find out
178.954	that my thinking was quite different.
182.133	"Like if I say, ""Think"
182.133	"about a church steeple,"""
184.333	most people get this sort
184.333	of generalized generic one.
186.87	Now, maybe that's not true in this room,
188.806	but it's going to be true
188.806	in a lot of different places.
192.096	I see only specific pictures.
194.623	They flash up into my memory,
194.623	just like Google for pictures.
198.456	And in the movie,
198.456	they've got a great scene in there,
201.023	"where the word ""shoe"" is said,"
201.023	and a whole bunch of '50s and '60s shoes
204.847	pop into my imagination.
206.908	OK, there's my childhood church;
206.908	that's specific.
209.807	There's some more, Fort Collins.
211.699	OK, how about famous ones?
213.77	And they just kind of come up,
213.77	kind of like this.
216.471	Just really quickly,
216.471	like Google for pictures.
219.406	And they come up one at a time,
220.989	"and then I think, ""OK, well,"
220.989	maybe we can have it snow,
223.964	"or we can have a thunderstorm,"""
225.612	and I can hold it there
225.612	and turn them into videos.
228.26	Now, visual thinking
228.26	was a tremendous asset
231.497	in my work designing
231.497	cattle-handling facilities.
234.799	And I've worked really hard
234.799	on improving how cattle are treated
238.023	at the slaughter plant.
239.199	I'm not going to go
239.199	into any gucky slaughter slides.
241.719	I've got that stuff up on YouTube,
241.719	if you want to look at it.
244.631	(Laughter)
245.696	But one of the things
245.696	that I was able to do in my design work
248.613	is I could test-run a piece
248.613	of equipment in my mind,
251.26	just like a virtual reality
251.26	computer system.
254.708	And this is an aerial view
254.708	of a recreation of one of my projects
258.373	that was used in the movie.
259.759	That was like just so super cool.
261.794	And there were a lot of, kind of,
261.794	Asperger types and autism types
265.296	working out there on the movie set, too.
267.268	(Laughter)
268.468	But one of the things
268.468	that really worries me is:
271.283	Where's the younger version
271.283	of those kids going today?
274.82	They're not ending up in Silicon Valley,
277.299	where they belong.
278.563	(Laughter)
280.407	(Applause)
285.339	One of the things I learned very early on
285.339	because I wasn't that social,
288.944	is I had to sell my work, and not myself.
292.706	And the way I sold livestock jobs
292.706	is I showed off my drawings,
295.69	I showed off pictures of things.
297.446	Another thing that helped me
297.446	as a little kid
299.709	is, boy, in the '50s,
299.709	you were taught manners.
301.962	You were taught you can't pull
301.962	the merchandise off the shelves
305.025	in the store and throw it around.
306.683	When kids get to be
306.683	in third or fourth grade,
308.859	you might see that this kid's going
308.859	to be a visual thinker,
311.711	drawing in perspective.
313	Now, I want to emphasize
314.222	that not every autistic kid
314.222	is going to be a visual thinker.
317.712	Now, I had this brain scan
317.712	done several years ago,
321.714	and I used to joke around about having
321.714	a gigantic Internet trunk line
325.671	going deep into my visual cortex.
327.622	This is tensor imaging.
329.521	And my great big Internet trunk line
329.521	is twice as big as the control's.
333.397	The red lines there are me,
335.025	and the blue lines are the sex
335.025	and age-matched control.
339.85	And there I got a gigantic one,
341.896	and the control over there, the blue one,
341.896	has got a really small one.
347.101	And some of the research now is showing
349.26	that people on the spectrum actually
349.26	think with the primary visual cortex.
353.315	Now, the thing is, the visual thinker
353.315	is just one kind of mind.
356.38	You see, the autistic mind
356.38	tends to be a specialist mind --
359.989	good at one thing, bad at something else.
363.102	And where I was bad was algebra.
364.88	And I was never allowed
364.88	to take geometry or trig.
367.194	Gigantic mistake.
368.381	I'm finding a lot of kids
368.381	who need to skip algebra,
370.84	go right to geometry and trig.
372.847	Now, another kind of mind
372.847	is the pattern thinker.
375.471	More abstract.
376.734	These are your engineers,
376.734	your computer programmers.
379.321	This is pattern thinking.
380.739	That praying mantis is made
380.739	from a single sheet of paper --
383.648	no scotch tape, no cuts.
385.089	And there in the background
385.089	is the pattern for folding it.
388.648	Here are the types of thinking:
390.731	photo-realistic visual thinkers, like me;
393.856	pattern thinkers, music and math minds.
397.26	Some of these oftentimes
397.26	have problems with reading.
399.872	You also will see these kind of problems
399.872	with kids that are dyslexic.
404.377	You'll see these different kinds of minds.
406.425	And then there's a verbal mind,
406.425	they know every fact about everything.
410.023	Now, another thing is the sensory issues.
412.013	I was really concerned about having
412.013	to wear this gadget on my face.
415.692	And I came in half an hour beforehand
417.87	so I could have it put on
417.87	and kind of get used to it,
420.877	and they got it bent
420.877	so it's not hitting my chin.
423.639	But sensory is an issue.
424.815	Some kids are bothered
424.815	by fluorescent lights;
426.988	others have problems
426.988	with sound sensitivity.
429.497	You know, it's going to be variable.
432.652	Now, visual thinking gave me
432.652	a whole lot of insight
436.096	into the animal mind.
438.38	Because think about it:
438.38	an animal is a sensory-based thinker,
441.837	not verbal -- thinks in pictures,
441.837	thinks in sounds, thinks in smells.
448.058	Think about how much information
448.058	there is on the local fire hydrant.
451.426	He knows who's been there --
452.812	(Laughter)
453.867	When they were there.
455.048	Are they friend or foe?
455.048	Is there anybody he can go mate with?
457.967	There's a ton of information
457.967	on that fire hydrant.
460.873	It's all very detailed information.
463.996	And looking at these kind of details
463.996	gave me a lot of insight into animals.
468.688	Now, the animal mind, and also my mind,
472.26	puts sensory-based information
472.26	into categories.
476.853	Man on a horse,
478.58	and a man on the ground --
480.159	that is viewed as two
480.159	totally different things.
482.968	You could have a horse
482.968	that's been abused by a rider.
485.491	They'll be absolutely fine
485.491	with the veterinarian
487.785	and with the horseshoer,
487.785	but you can't ride him.
490.26	You have another horse,
490.26	where maybe the horseshoer beat him up,
493.459	and he'll be terrible for anything
493.459	on the ground with the veterinarian,
497.478	but a person can ride him.
499.517	Cattle are the same way.
500.848	Man on a horse, a man on foot --
500.848	they're two different things.
504.797	You see, it's a different picture.
506.777	See, I want you to think
506.777	about just how specific this is.
509.922	Now, this ability to put
509.922	information into categories,
513.333	I find a lot of people
513.333	are not very good at this.
516.709	When I'm out troubleshooting equipment
518.901	or problems with something in a plant,
520.753	they don't seem to be able to figure out:
522.782	"""Do I have a training-people issue?"
524.506	Or do I have something wrong
524.506	"with the equipment?"""
526.965	In other words, categorize
526.965	equipment problem from a people problem.
530.683	I find a lot of people
530.683	have difficulty doing that.
533.803	Now, let's say I figure out
533.803	it's an equipment problem.
536.391	Is it a minor problem,
536.391	with something simple I can fix?
539.191	Or is the whole design
539.191	of the system wrong?
541.53	People have a hard time figuring that out.
544.26	Let's just look at something
544.26	like, you know,
546.38	solving problems with making
546.38	airlines safer.
548.65	Yeah, I'm a million-mile flier.
550.26	I do lots and lots of flying,
552.11	and if I was at the FAA,
555.366	what would I be doing a lot
555.366	of direct observation of?
559.457	It would be their airplane tails.
561.785	You know, five fatal wrecks
561.785	in the last 20 years,
564.359	the tail either came off,
566.158	or steering stuff inside the tail
566.158	broke in some way.
570.007	It's tails, pure and simple.
572.084	And when the pilots walk
572.084	around the plane, guess what?
574.641	They can't see that stuff inside the tail.
576.716	Now as I think about that,
578.177	I'm pulling up all of that
578.177	specific information.
581.66	It's specific.
582.857	See, my thinking's bottom-up.
584.376	I take all the little pieces and I put
584.376	the pieces together like a puzzle.
588.097	Now, here is a horse that was deathly
588.097	afraid of black cowboy hats.
591.888	He'd been abused by somebody
591.888	with a black cowboy hat.
594.472	White cowboy hats,
594.472	that was absolutely fine.
597.856	Now, the thing is,
597.856	the world is going to need
600.43	all of the different kinds of minds
600.43	to work together.
604.543	We've got to work on developing
604.543	all these different kinds of minds.
607.758	And one of the things
607.758	that is driving me really crazy
610.324	as I travel around
610.324	and I do autism meetings,
612.695	is I'm seeing a lot of smart,
612.695	geeky, nerdy kids,
615.86	and they just aren't very social,
618.059	and nobody's working
618.059	on developing their interest
621.174	in something like science.
622.926	And this brings up the whole thing
622.926	of my science teacher.
625.637	My science teacher is shown
625.637	absolutely beautifully in the movie.
628.769	I was a goofball student
628.769	when I was in high school.
631.279	I just didn't care at all about studying,
633.331	until I had Mr. Carlock's science class.
636.584	He was now Dr. Carlock in the movie.
639.357	And he got me challenged
639.357	to figure out an optical illusion room.
645.26	This brings up the whole thing
645.26	of you've got to show kids
647.999	interesting stuff.
649.574	You know, one of the things
649.574	that I think maybe TED ought to do
652.911	is tell all the schools about all
652.911	the great lectures that are on TED,
656.25	and there's all kinds
656.25	of great stuff on the Internet
658.761	to get these kids turned on.
660.157	Because I'm seeing a lot
660.157	of these geeky, nerdy kids,
662.667	and the teachers out in the Midwest
662.667	and other parts of the country
665.875	when you get away from these tech areas,
667.837	they don't know what to do
667.837	with these kids.
669.873	And they're not going down the right path.
671.918	The thing is, you can make a mind
673.724	to be more of a thinking
673.724	and cognitive mind,
676.473	or your mind can be wired
676.473	to be more social.
678.972	And what some of the research
678.972	now has shown in autism
681.627	is there may by extra wiring back here
681.627	in the really brilliant mind,
685.121	and we lose a few social circuits here.
687.058	It's kind of a trade-off
687.058	between thinking and social.
690.033	And then you can get to the point
690.033	where it's so severe,
692.649	you're going to have a person
692.649	that's going to be non-verbal.
695.529	In the normal human mind,
697.26	language covers up the visual thinking
697.26	we share with animals.
700.906	This is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller.
704.756	He studied Alzheimer's patients
704.756	that had frontal temporal lobe dementia.
708.512	And the dementia ate out
708.512	the language parts of the brain.
711.559	And then this artwork came out of somebody
713.854	who used to install stereos in cars.
716.827	Now, Van Gogh doesn't know
716.827	anything about physics,
720.517	but I think it's very interesting
720.517	that there was some work done
723.862	to show that this eddy pattern
723.862	in this painting
726.609	followed a statistical model
726.609	of turbulence,
729.781	which brings up the whole interesting idea
731.824	of maybe some of this mathematical
731.824	patterns is in our own head.
735.586	And the Wolfram stuff --
737.163	I was taking notes and writing down
737.163	all the search words I could use,
741.753	because I think that's going to go on
741.753	in my autism lectures.
745.104	We've got to show
745.104	these kids interesting stuff.
747.555	And they've taken out the auto-shop class
749.846	and the drafting class and the art class.
751.97	I mean, art was my best subject in school.
754.26	We've got to think about all
754.26	these different kinds of minds,
757.143	and we've got to absolutely
757.143	work with these kind of minds,
759.947	because we absolutely are going to need
762.259	these kinds of people in the future.
765.26	And let's talk about jobs.
767.524	OK, my science teacher got me studying,
769.741	because I was a goofball
769.741	that didn't want to study.
772.179	But you know what?
772.179	I was getting work experience.
774.548	I'm seeing too many of these smart kids
774.548	who haven't learned basic things,
778.036	like how to be on time -- I was taught
778.036	that when I was eight years old.
781.508	How to have table manners
781.508	at granny's Sunday party.
784.087	I was taught that
784.087	when I was very, very young.
786.746	And when I was 13, I had a job
786.746	at a dressmaker's shop sewing clothes.
791.747	I did internships in college,
794.359	I was building things,
797.586	and I also had to learn
797.586	how to do assignments.
800.627	You know, all I wanted to do was draw
800.627	pictures of horses when I was little.
804.241	"My mother said, ""Well let's do"
804.241	"a picture of something else."""
807.093	They've got to learn
807.093	how to do something else.
809.281	Let's say the kid is fixated on Legos.
811.149	Let's get him working
811.149	on building different things.
813.87	The thing about the autistic mind
813.87	is it tends to be fixated.
817.49	Like if the kid loves race cars,
817.49	let's use race cars for math.
821.392	Let's figure out how long it takes
821.392	a race car to go a certain distance.
824.856	In other words, use that fixation
827.993	in order to motivate that kid,
827.993	that's one of the things we need to do.
831.873	I really get fed up when the teachers,
834.985	especially when you get away
834.985	from this part of the country,
837.811	they don't know what to do
837.811	with these smart kids.
840.215	It just drives me crazy.
841.402	What can visual thinkers
841.402	do when they grow up?
843.668	They can do graphic design,
843.668	all kinds of stuff with computers,
846.641	photography, industrial design.
851.643	The pattern thinkers -- they're the ones
851.643	that are going to be your mathematicians,
855.599	your software engineers,
855.599	your computer programmers,
858.13	all of those kinds of jobs.
860.117	And then you've got the word minds;
860.117	they make great journalists,
863.713	and they also make really,
863.713	really good stage actors.
866.26	Because the thing about being autistic is,
868.676	I had to learn social skills
868.676	like being in a play.
871.531	You just kind of ...
871.531	you just have to learn it.
874.26	And we need to be working
874.26	with these students.
877.26	And this brings up mentors.
879.392	You know, my science teacher
879.392	was not an accredited teacher.
882.516	He was a NASA space scientist.
884.26	Some states now are getting it to where,
884.26	if you have a degree in biology
887.688	or in chemistry,
888.983	you can come into the school
888.983	and teach biology or chemistry.
891.844	We need to be doing that.
893.8	Because what I'm observing is,
895.614	the good teachers,
895.614	for a lot of these kids,
897.687	are out in the community colleges.
899.359	But we need to be getting
899.359	some of these good teachers
901.919	into the high schools.
903.094	Another thing that can be very,
903.094	very, very successful is:
906.674	there's a lot of people
906.674	that may have retired
908.806	from working in the software industry,
910.652	and they can teach your kid.
912.064	And it doesn't matter
912.064	if what they teach them is old,
914.897	because what you're doing
914.897	is you're lighting the spark.
917.648	You're getting that kid turned on.
920.136	And you get him turned on,
920.136	then you'll learn all the new stuff.
923.575	Mentors are just essential.
925.863	I cannot emphasize enough
925.863	what my science teacher did for me.
930.204	And we've got to mentor them, hire them.
933.26	And if you bring them in
933.26	for internships in your companies,
936.092	the thing about the autism,
936.092	Asperger-y kind of mind,
938.589	you've got to give them a specific task.
940.581	"Don't just say, ""Design new software."""
942.447	You've got to tell them
942.447	something more specific:
944.738	"""We're designing software for a phone"
946.659	and it has to do some specific thing,
948.483	"and it can only use so much memory."""
950.26	That's the kind of specificity you need.
952.711	Well, that's the end of my talk.
954.594	And I just want to thank
954.594	everybody for coming.
956.861	It was great to be here.
958.26	(Applause)
969.786	(Applause ends)
972.001	Oh -- you have a question for me? OK.
973.85	(Applause)
976.271	Chris Anderson:
976.271	Thank you so much for that.
978.323	You know, you once wrote --
978.323	I like this quote:
980.673	"""If by some magic, autism had been"
980.673	eradicated from the face of the Earth,
985.258	then men would still be socializing
985.258	in front of a wood fire
988.259	"at the entrance to a cave."""
989.624	(Laughter)
990.676	Temple Grandin: Because who do you think
990.676	made the first stone spear?
993.936	It was the Asperger guy,
995.118	and if you were to get rid
995.118	of all the autism genetics,
997.695	there'd be no more Silicon Valley,
997.695	and the energy crisis would not be solved.
1001.384	(Applause)
1002.749	CA: I want to ask you
1002.749	a couple other questions,
1005.003	and if any of these feel inappropriate,
1005.003	"it's OK just to say, ""Next question."""
1008.791	But if there is someone here
1008.791	who has an autistic child,
1012.429	or knows an autistic child and feels
1012.429	kind of cut off from them,
1017.793	what advice would you give them?
1019.664	TG: Well, first of all,
1019.664	we've got to look at age.
1022.017	If you have a two, three or four-year-old,
1022.017	no speech, no social interaction,
1025.99	I can't emphasize enough: Don't wait.
1028.303	You need at least 20 hours a week
1028.303	of one-to-one teaching.
1031.612	The thing is, autism comes
1031.612	in different degrees.
1034.129	About half of the people on the spectrum
1034.129	are not going to learn to talk,
1037.66	and they won't be working
1037.66	in Silicon Valley.
1039.785	That would not be a reasonable
1039.785	thing for them to do.
1042.259	But then you get these smart,
1042.259	geeky kids with a touch of autism,
1045.36	and that's where you've got
1045.36	to get them turned on
1047.864	with doing interesting things.
1049.377	I got social interaction
1049.377	through shared interests --
1052.416	I rode horses with other kids,
1052.416	I made model rockets with other kids,
1056.397	did electronics lab with other kids.
1058.399	And in the '60s, it was gluing mirrors
1058.399	onto a rubber membrane on a speaker
1062.674	to make a light show.
1063.879	That was, like,
1063.879	we considered that super cool.
1066.125	(Laughter)
1067.155	CA: Is it unrealistic for them
1068.676	to hope or think that that child
1068.676	loves them, as some might, as most, wish?
1073.44	TG: Well, I tell you,
1073.44	that child will be loyal,
1075.698	and if your house is burning down,
1075.698	they're going to get you out of it.
1079.097	CA: Wow. So most people, if you ask them
1079.097	what they're most passionate about,
1082.78	they'd say things like,
1082.78	"""My kids"" or ""My lover."""
1086.27	What are you most passionate about?
1088.046	TG: I'm passionate
1088.046	about that the things I do
1091.101	are going to make
1091.101	the world a better place.
1093.162	When I have a mother
1093.162	of an autistic child say,
1095.408	"""My kid went to college"
1095.408	because of your book
1097.494	"or one of your lectures,"""
1098.718	that makes me happy.
1099.893	You know, the slaughter plants
1099.893	I worked with in the '80s;
1102.63	they were absolutely awful.
1103.971	I developed a really simple
1103.971	scoring system for slaughter plants,
1107.271	where you just measure outcomes:
1108.847	How many cattle fell down?
1110.113	How many got poked with the prodder?
1111.885	How many cattle
1111.885	are mooing their heads off?
1114.278	And it's very, very simple.
1115.636	You directly observe a few simple things.
1117.637	It's worked really well.
1118.825	I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff
1121.188	that makes real change in the real world.
1123.932	We need a lot more of that,
1123.932	and a lot less abstract stuff.
1126.705	CA: Totally.
1127.88	(Applause)
1132.987	CA: When we were talking on the phone,
1132.987	one of the things you said
1136.11	that really astonished me
1137.336	was that one thing you were passionate
1137.336	about was server farms.
1141.103	Tell me about that.
1142.278	TG: Well, the reason why I got really
1142.278	excited when I read about that,
1145.679	it contains knowledge.
1147.359	It's libraries.
1149.041	And to me, knowledge is something
1149.041	that is extremely valuable.
1152.584	So, maybe over 10 years ago
1152.584	now, our library got flooded.
1155.724	This is before the Internet
1155.724	got really big.
1157.799	And I was really upset
1157.799	about all the books being wrecked,
1160.504	because it was knowledge being destroyed.
1162.504	And server farms, or data centers,
1162.504	are great libraries of knowledge.
1166.941	CA: Temple, can I just say,
1168.256	it's an absolute delight
1168.256	to have you at TED.
1170.366	Thank you so much.
1171.541	TG: Well, thank you so much. Thank you.
1173.46	(Applause)
