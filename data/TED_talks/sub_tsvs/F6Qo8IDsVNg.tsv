13.272	Picture this:
14.649	It's Monday morning,
15.742	you're at the office,
16.861	you're settling in for the day at work,
18.615	and this guy that you sort of 
18.615	recognize from down the hall,
21.437	walks right into your cubicle
23.273	and he steals your chair.
24.675	Doesn't say a word —
25.917	just rolls away with it.
27.305	Doesn't give you any information
27.305	about why he took your chair
29.788	out of all the other chairs 
29.788	that are out there.
31.899	Doesn't acknowledge the fact 
31.899	that you might need your chair
34.041	to get some work done today.
35.582	You wouldn't stand for 
35.582	it. You'd make a stink.
37.839	You'd follow that guy
37.839	back to his cubicle
39.866	"and you'd say, ""Why my chair?"""
43.178	Okay, so now it's Tuesday morning
43.178	and you're at the office,
47.299	and a meeting invitation pops 
47.299	up in your calendar.
50.028	(Laughter)
51.633	And it's from this woman who you 
51.633	kind of know from down the hall,
54.709	and the subject line references some 
54.709	project that you heard a little bit about.
58.514	But there's no agenda.
60.197	There's no information about why
60.197	you were invited to the meeting.
63.273	And yet you accept the 
63.273	meeting invitation, and you go.
67.889	And when this highly 
67.889	unproductive session is over,
70.816	you go back to your desk,
72.499	and you stand at your 
72.499	desk and you say,
74.008	"""Boy, I wish I had those two hours back,"
76.671	"like I wish I had my chair back."""
78.674	(Laughter)
80.18	Every day, we allow our coworkers,
82.751	who are otherwise very, 
82.751	very nice people,
84.965	to steal from us.
86.632	And I'm talking about something far 
86.632	more valuable than office furniture.
90.71	I'm talking about time. Your time.
93.739	In fact, I believe that
96.392	we are in the middle
96.392	of a global epidemic
98.877	of a terrible new illness
98.877	known as MAS:
103.917	Mindless Accept Syndrome.
106.19	(Laughter)
108.084	The primary symptom of 
108.084	Mindless Accept Syndrome
110.785	is just accepting a meeting invitation
110.785	the minute it pops up in your calendar.
114.705	(Laughter)
115.975	It's an involuntary reflex — ding, 
115.975	click, bing — it's in your calendar,
119.643	"""Gotta go, I'm already late "
119.643	"for a meeting."" (Laughter)"
122.936	Meetings are important, right?
125.323	And collaboration is key to 
125.323	the success of any enterprise.
128.269	And a well-run meeting can yield 
128.269	really positive, actionable results.
131.662	But between globalization
133.42	and pervasive information technology,
135.735	the way that we work
137.406	has really changed dramatically 
137.406	over the last few years.
140.635	And we're miserable. (Laughter)
143.842	And we're miserable not because the 
143.842	other guy can't run a good meeting,
147.382	it's because of MAS, our 
147.382	Mindless Accept Syndrome,
150.194	which is a self-inflicted wound.
153.97	Actually, I have evidence to prove
153.97	that MAS is a global epidemic.
159.117	Let me tell you why.
160.764	A couple of years ago, I put a video 
160.764	on Youtube, and in the video,
165.036	I acted out every terrible 
165.036	conference call you've ever been on.
168.234	It goes on for about five minutes,
169.893	and it has all the things that we 
169.893	hate about really bad meetings.
173.084	There's the moderator who has 
173.084	no idea how to run the meeting.
176.427	There are the participants who 
176.427	have no idea why they're there.
178.985	The whole thing kind of collapses
178.985	into this collaborative train wreck.
182.688	And everybody leaves very angry.
185.114	It's kind of funny.
186.903	(Laughter)
188.486	Let's take a quick look.
190.638	(Video) Our goal today is to come to an 
190.638	agreement on a very important proposal.
194.465	As a group, we need to decide if —
196.552	bloop bloop —
199.331	Hi, who just joined?
202.898	Hi, it's Joe. I'm working from home today.
205.91	(Laughter)
207.8	Hi, Joe. Thanks for 
207.8	joining us today, great.
210.868	I was just saying, we have a lot of people 
210.868	on the call we'd like to get through,
213.658	so let's skip the roll call 
215.292	and I'm gonna dive right in.
217.965	Our goal today is to come to an 
217.965	agreement on a very important proposal.
221.84	As a group, we need to decide if —
224.405	bloop bloop —
225.698	(Laughter)
227.161	Hi, who just joined?
229.184	No? I thought I heard a beep. (Laughter)
233.993	Sound familiar?
235.629	Yeah, it sounds familiar 
235.629	to me, too.
237.606	A couple of weeks after I put that online,
242.463	I mean dozens of countries,
244.103	watched this video.
245.287	And three years later, it's still getting 
245.287	thousands of views every month.
248.641	It's close to about a million right now.
250.608	And in fact, some of the biggest
250.608	companies in the world,
252.616	companies that you've 
252.616	heard of but I won't name,
254.526	have asked for my permission to use 
254.526	this video in their new-hire training
258.421	to teach their new employees how 
258.421	not to run a meeting at their company.
262.67	And if the numbers —
264.155	there are a million views and it's
264.155	being used by all these companies —
266.536	aren't enough proof that we have 
266.536	a global problem with meetings,
270.062	there are the many, many thousands
271.839	of comments posted online
273.459	after the video went up.
275.647	Thousands of people wrote things like,
277.621	"""OMG, that was my day today!"""
279.475	"""That was my day every day!"""
281.438	"""This is my life."""
282.597	One guy wrote,
283.527	"""It's funny because it's true."
285.066	Eerily, sadly, depressingly true.
286.973	It made me laugh until I cried.
288.691	"And cried. And I cried some more."""
291.441	(Laughter)
293.073	This poor guy said,
294.534	"""My daily life until "
294.534	"retirement or death, sigh."""
299.611	These are real quotes
301.011	and it's real sad.
302.81	A common theme running through
302.81	all of these comments online
305.633	is this fundamental belief 
305.633	that we are powerless
308.174	to do anything other 
308.174	than go to meetings
310.075	and suffer through these 
310.075	poorly run meetings
312.453	and live to meet another day.
314.542	But the truth is, we're 
314.542	not powerless at all.
317.683	In fact, the cure for MAS
317.683	is right here in our hands.
320.792	It's right at our fingertips, literally.
322.977	It's something that I call ¡No MAS!
326.238	(Laughter)
328.468	Which, if I remember my 
328.468	high school Spanish,
330.866	means something like, 
330.866	"""Enough already, make it stop!"""
333.657	Here's how No MAS 
333.657	works. It's very simple.
336.409	First of all, the next time you 
336.409	get a meeting invitation
339.606	that doesn't have a lot 
339.606	of information in it at all,
342.453	click the tentative button!
344.293	It's okay, you're allowed, 
344.293	that's why it's there.
346.743	It's right next to the accept button.
348.252	Or the maybe button, or whatever button 
348.252	is there for you not to accept immediately.
351.846	Then, get in touch with the person
351.846	who asked you to the meeting.
355.629	Tell them you're very excited 
355.629	to support their work,
358.215	ask them what the goal 
358.215	of the meeting is,
360.23	and tell them you're interested in learning 
360.23	how you can help them achieve their goal.
363.917	And if we do this often enough,
365.845	and we do it respectfully,
367.183	people might start to be 
367.183	a little bit more thoughtful
369.22	about the way they put together
369.22	meeting invitations.
371.682	And you can make more thoughtful 
371.682	decisions about accepting it.
374.534	People might actually start 
374.534	sending out agendas. Imagine!
377.794	Or they might not have a conference call
377.794	with 12 people to talk about a status
381.542	when they could just do a quick
381.542	email and get it done with.
384.825	People just might start to change their 
384.825	behavior because you changed yours.
389.659	And they just might bring
389.659	your chair back, too. (Laughter)
393.144	No MAS!
394.519	Thank you.
395.959	(Applause).
