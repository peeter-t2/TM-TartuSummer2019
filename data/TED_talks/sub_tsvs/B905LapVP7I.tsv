12.694	So there's a lot of valid
12.694	concern these days
14.87	that our technology is getting so smart
17.099	that we've put ourselves
17.099	on the path to a jobless future.
21.502	And I think the example
21.502	of a self-driving car
23.678	is actually the easiest one to see.
25.376	So these are going to be fantastic
25.376	for all kinds of different reasons.
28.728	"But did you know that ""driver"""
28.728	is actually the most common job
32.19	in 29 of the 50 US states?
34.862	What's going to happen to these jobs
34.862	when we're no longer driving our cars
38.364	or cooking our food
39.553	or even diagnosing our own diseases?
42.495	Well, a recent study
42.495	from Forrester Research
44.896	goes so far to predict
44.896	that 25 million jobs
48.083	might disappear over the next 10 years.
51.213	To put that in perspective,
52.726	that's three times as many jobs lost
52.726	in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
58.426	And it's not just blue-collar jobs
58.426	that are at risk.
61.548	On Wall Street and across Silicon Valley,
61.548	we are seeing tremendous gains
64.999	in the quality of analysis
64.999	and decision-making
67.205	because of machine learning.
68.883	So even the smartest, highest-paid people
68.883	will be affected by this change.
73.534	What's clear is that no matter
73.534	what your job is,
76.228	at least some, if not all of your work,
78.224	is going to be done by a robot
78.224	or software in the next few years.
82.738	And that's exactly why people
82.738	like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates
85.833	are talking about the need for
85.833	government-funded minimum income levels.
89.245	But if our politicians can't agree
89.245	on things like health care
92.611	or even school lunches,
93.914	I just don't see a path
93.914	where they'll find consensus
96.368	on something as big and as expensive
96.368	as universal basic life income.
100.436	Instead, I think the response
100.436	needs to be led by us in industry.
104.105	We have to recognize
104.105	the change that's ahead of us
106.653	and start to design the new kinds of jobs
108.652	that will still be relevant
108.652	in the age of robotics.
112.719	The good news is that we have
112.719	faced down and recovered
115.496	two mass extinctions of jobs before.
118.343	From 1870 to 1970,
120.577	the percent of American workers
120.577	based on farms fell by 90 percent,
125.009	and then again from 1950 to 2010,
127.578	the percent of Americans
127.578	working in factories
129.745	fell by 75 percent.
132.39	The challenge we face this time,
132.39	however, is one of time.
135.368	We had a hundred years
135.368	to move from farms to factories,
138.406	and then 60 years to fully build out
138.406	a service economy.
141.498	The rate of change today
142.847	suggests that we may only have
145.845	and if we don't react fast enough,
147.572	that means by the time
147.572	today's elementary-school students
150.352	are college-aged,
152.261	we could be living
152.261	in a world that's robotic,
154.426	largely unemployed and stuck
154.426	in kind of un-great depression.
159.617	But I don't think it has to be this way.
161.58	You see, I work in innovation,
163.304	and part of my job is to shape how
163.304	large companies apply new technologies.
168.085	Certainly some of these technologies
169.904	are even specifically designed
169.904	to replace human workers.
173.435	But I believe that if we start
173.435	taking steps right now
176.385	to change the nature of work,
178.23	we can not only create environments
178.23	where people love coming to work
182.14	but also generate
182.14	the innovation that we need
184.282	to replace the millions of jobs
184.282	that will be lost to technology.
188.352	I believe that the key
188.352	to preventing our jobless future
192.175	is to rediscover what makes us human,
194.545	and to create a new generation
194.545	of human-centered jobs
197.527	that allow us to unlock
197.527	the hidden talents and passions
200.157	that we carry with us every day.
203.971	But first, I think
203.971	it's important to recognize
206.138	that we brought this problem on ourselves.
208.314	And it's not just because, you know,
208.314	we are the one building the robots.
212.327	But even though most jobs
212.327	left the factory decades ago,
215.535	we still hold on to this factory mindset
217.496	of standardization and de-skilling.
220.345	We still define jobs
220.345	around procedural tasks
222.72	and then pay people for the number
222.72	of hours that they perform these tasks.
226.232	We've created narrow job definitions
228.012	like cashier, loan processor
228.012	or taxi driver
231.276	and then asked people
231.276	to form entire careers
233.783	around these singular tasks.
236.071	These choices have left us with
236.071	actually two dangerous side effects.
239.628	The first is that these
239.628	narrowly defined jobs
242.402	will be the first
242.402	to be displaced by robots,
244.849	because single-task robots
244.849	are just the easiest kinds to build.
248.601	But second, we have accidentally made it
251.018	so that millions of workers
251.018	around the world
253.17	have unbelievably boring working lives.
255.877	(Laughter)
258.247	Let's take the example
258.247	of a call center agent.
260.673	Over the last few decades,
260.673	we brag about lower operating costs
263.7	because we've taken most
263.7	of the need for brainpower
266.151	out of the person
266.151	and put it into the system.
268.319	For most of their day,
268.319	they click on screens,
270.864	they read scripts.
273.307	They act more like machines than humans.
277.098	And unfortunately,
277.098	over the next few years,
279.238	as our technology gets more advanced,
281.121	they, along with people
281.121	like clerks and bookkeepers,
283.729	will see the vast majority
283.729	of their work disappear.
287.315	To counteract this,
287.315	we have to start creating new jobs
290.043	that are less centered
290.043	on the tasks that a person does
292.606	and more focused on the skills
292.606	that a person brings to work.
296.209	For example, robots are great
296.209	at repetitive and constrained work,
299.62	but human beings have an amazing ability
301.593	to bring together
301.593	capability with creativity
303.896	when faced with problems
303.896	that we've never seen before.
306.942	It's when every day
306.942	brings a little bit of a surprise
309.946	that we have designed work for humans
311.974	and not for robots.
313.95	Our entrepreneurs and engineers
313.95	already live in this world,
316.872	but so do our nurses and our plumbers
319.488	and our therapists.
321.569	You know, it's the nature
321.569	of too many companies and organizations
324.65	to just ask people to come to work
324.65	and do your job.
328.364	But if you work is better done by a robot,
330.574	or your decisions better made by an AI,
333.395	what are you supposed to be doing?
335.833	Well, I think for the manager,
338.341	we need to realistically think about
338.341	the tasks that will be disappearing
341.762	over the next few years
342.937	and start planning for more meaningful,
342.937	more valuable work that should replace it.
346.833	We need to create environments
348.286	where both human beings and robots thrive.
350.549	I say, let's give more work to the robots,
353.109	and let's start with the work
353.109	that we absolutely hate doing.
357.248	Here, robot,
358.436	process this painfully idiotic report.
360.311	(Laughter)
361.758	And move this box. Thank you.
363.207	(Laughter)
364.93	And for the human beings,
366.483	we should follow the advice from Harry
366.483	Davis at the University of Chicago.
370.061	He says we have to make it so that people
370.061	don't leave too much of themselves
373.734	in the trunk of their car.
375.089	I mean, human beings
375.089	are amazing on weekends.
378.002	Think about the people that you know
378.002	and what they do on Saturdays.
381.17	They're artists, carpenters,
381.17	chefs and athletes.
384.906	But on Monday, they're back
384.906	to being Junior HR Specialist
388.826	and Systems Analyst 3.
390.949	(Laughter)
394.754	You know, these narrow job titles
394.754	not only sound boring,
398.096	but they're actually
398.096	a subtle encouragement
400.216	for people to make narrow
400.216	and boring job contributions.
403.28	But I've seen firsthand
403.28	that when you invite people to be more,
406.42	they can amaze us
406.42	with how much more they can be.
410.147	A few years ago,
410.147	I was working at a large bank
412.404	that was trying to bring more innovation
412.404	into its company culture.
415.524	So my team and I designed
415.524	a prototyping contest
417.889	that invited anyone to build
417.889	anything that they wanted.
421.524	We were actually trying to figure out
423.381	whether or not
423.381	the primary limiter to innovation
425.673	was a lack of ideas or a lack of talent,
428.187	and it turns out it was neither one.
430.072	It was an empowerment problem.
432.518	And the results
432.518	of the program were amazing.
436.198	We started by inviting
436.198	people to reenvision
438.599	what it is they could bring to a team.
440.738	This contest was not only a chance
440.738	to build anything that you wanted
444.5	but also be anything that you wanted.
446.86	And when people were no longer
446.86	limited by their day-to-day job titles,
450.17	they felt free to bring all kinds
450.17	of different skills and talents
453.341	to the problems
453.341	that they were trying to solve.
455.851	We saw technology people being designers,
455.851	marketing people being architects,
459.785	and even finance people showing off
459.785	their ability to write jokes.
463.427	(Laughter)
464.601	We ran this program twice,
466.03	and each time more than 400 people
466.03	brought their unexpected talents to work
469.85	and solved problems that they had been
469.85	wanting to solve for years.
473.31	Collectively, they created
473.31	millions of dollars of value,
476.353	building things like a better
476.353	touch-tone system for call centers,
480.942	easier desktop tools for branches
482.634	and even a thank you card system
484.183	that has become a cornerstone
484.183	of the employee working experience.
487.521	Over the course of the eight weeks,
489.348	people flexed muscles that they never
489.348	dreamed of using at work.
494.173	People learned new skills,
495.774	they met new people,
498.166	and at the end, somebody
498.166	pulled me aside and said,
500.983	"""I have to tell you,"
502.576	the last few weeks has been
502.576	one of the most intense,
505.376	hardest working experiences
505.376	of my entire life,
508.679	"but not one second of it felt like work."""
511.9	And that's the key.
513.222	For those few weeks, people
513.222	got to be creators and innovators.
518.631	They had been dreaming of solutions
520.322	to problems that had been
520.322	bugging them for years,
522.83	and this was a chance to turn
522.83	those dreams into a reality.
526.489	And that dreaming is an important part
526.489	of what separates us from machines.
530.955	For now, our machines
530.955	do not get frustrated,
533.997	they do not get annoyed,
535.428	and they certainly don't imagine.
537.712	But we, as human beings --
539.435	we feel pain,
540.666	we get frustrated.
542.09	And it's when we're most annoyed
542.09	and most curious
545.23	that we're motivated to dig
545.23	into a problem and create change.
549.366	Our imaginations are the birthplace
549.366	of new products, new services,
553.3	and even new industries.
555.296	I believe that the jobs of the future
557.122	will come from the minds of people
558.859	who today we call
558.859	analysts and specialists,
561.599	but only if we give them the freedom
561.599	and protection that they need to grow
565.101	into becoming explorers and inventors.
568.534	If we really want to robot-proof our jobs,
570.701	we, as leaders, need
570.701	to get out of the mindset
572.96	of telling people what to do
574.814	and instead start asking them
574.814	what problems they're inspired to solve
578.659	and what talents
578.659	they want to bring to work.
581.501	Because when you can bring
581.501	your Saturday self to work on Wednesdays,
584.968	you'll look forward to Mondays more,
586.986	and those feelings
586.986	that we have about Mondays
589.692	are part of what makes us human.
592.287	And as we redesign work
592.287	for an era of intelligent machines,
595.319	I invite you all to work alongside me
597.559	to bring more humanity
597.559	to our working lives.
600.225	Thank you.
601.4	(Applause)
