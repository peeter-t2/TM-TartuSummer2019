25	I'm a medical illustrator,
28	and I come from a slightly different point of view.
31	I've been watching, since I grew up,
34	the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts
38	and truth and beauty in the sciences.
40	And while these are both wonderful things in their own right --
43	they both have very wonderful things going for them --
46	truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences
52	and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins
57	that a scientist would want to date.
60	(Laughter)
62	These are expressions of truth as awe-full things,
67	by meaning they are things you can worship.
70	They are ideals that are powerful. They are irreducible.
75	They are unique. They are useful --
77	sometimes, often a long time after the fact.
80	And you can actually roll some of the pictures now,
82	because I don't want to look at me on the screen.
86	Truth and beauty are things
88	that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences.
93	They are things that describe beauty in a way
99	that is often only accessible if you understand the language
104	and the syntax of the person
106	who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed.
109	If you look at the math, E=mc squared,
112	if you look at the cosmological constant,
115	where there's an anthropic ideal, where you see that life had to evolve
120	from the numbers that describe the universe --
123	these are things that are really difficult to understand.
126	And what I've tried to do
127	since I had my training as a medical illustrator --
129	since I was taught animation by my father,
132	who was a sculptor and my visual mentor --
136	I wanted to figure out a way to help people
140	understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences
144	by using animation, by using pictures, by telling stories
148	so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people
152	can be brought forth, and can be taught, and can be understood.
156	Students today are often immersed in an environment
162	where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty
167	embedded in them, but the way they're taught is compartmentalized
172	and it's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty
177	are not always evident.
178	It's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup
181	where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone.
186	We don't want to do that to our students.
188	So we have an opportunity to really open up education.
192	And I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard,
195	in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department,
197	a couple of years ago. He asked me if my team and I
201	would be interested and willing to really change
205	how medical and scientific education is done at Harvard.
208	So we embarked on a project that would explore the cell --
213	that would explore the truth and beauty inherent
216	in molecular and cellular biology
218	so that students could understand a larger picture
221	that they could hang all of these facts on.
224	They could have a mental image of the cell
227	as a large, bustling, hugely complicated city
235	that's occupied by micro-machines.
237	And these micro-machines really are at the heart of life.
240	These micro-machines,
241	which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over,
245	are self-directed, powerful, precise, accurate devices
252	that are made out of strings of amino acids.
255	And these micro-machines power how a cell moves.
259	They power how a cell replicates. They power our hearts.
264	They power our minds.
266	And so what we wanted to do was to figure out
270	how we could make this story into an animation
273	that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard,
277	which is a website that Harvard has
281	for its molecular and cellular biology students
283	that will -- in addition to all the textual information,
288	in addition to all the didactic stuff --
290	put everything together visually, so that these students
293	would have an internalized view of what a cell really is
297	in all of its truth and beauty, and be able to study
301	with this view in mind, so that their imaginations would be sparked,
305	so that their passions would be sparked
308	and so that they would be able to go on
310	and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries
314	and to be able to find out, really, how life works.
317	So we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together.
324	We worked with a theme, which is, you've got macrophages
330	that are streaming down a capillary,
332	and they're touching the surface of the capillary wall,
335	and they're picking up information from cells
337	that are on the capillary wall, and they are given this information
341	that there's an inflammation somewhere outside,
344	where they can't see and sense.
346	But they get the information that causes them to stop,
349	causes them to internalize that they need to make
353	all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape,
358	and try to get out of this capillary and find out what's going on.
363	So these molecular motors -- we had to work
365	with the Harvard scientists and databank models
371	of the atomically accurate molecules
374	and figure out how they moved, and figure out what they did.
378	And figure out how to do this in a way
380	that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on,
386	but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell
391	would prevent the vista from happening.
394	And so what I'm going to show you is a three-minute
398	Reader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film
401	that we produced. It's an ongoing project
404	that's going to go another four or five years.
407	And I want you to look at this
409	and see the paths that the cell manufactures --
413	these little walking machines, they're called kinesins --
417	that take these huge loads
419	that would challenge an ant in relative size.
422	Run the movie, please.
426	But these machines that power the inside of the cells
429	are really quite amazing, and they really are the basis of all life
433	because all of these machines interact with each other.
438	They pass information to each other.
440	They cause different things to happen inside the cell.
443	And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs
446	on the fly, from information
448	that's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes.
453	No life, from the smallest life to everybody here,
458	would be possible without these little micro-machines.
461	In fact, it would really, in the absence of these machines,
465	have made the attendance here, Chris, really quite sparse.
467	(Laughter)
471	(Music)
483	This is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell.
487	This little guy is called the kinesin,
489	and he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins
493	to wherever it's needed in the cell --
495	whether it's to a membrane, whether it's to an organelle,
498	whether it's to build something or repair something.
500	And each of us has about 100,000 of these things
504	running around, right now,
506	inside each one of your 100 trillion cells.
509	So no matter how lazy you feel,
512	you're not really intrinsically doing nothing.
514	(Laughter)
518	So what I want you to do when you go home
520	is think about this, and think about how powerful our cells are.
524	And think about some of the things
525	that we're learning about cellular mechanics.
529	Once we figure out all that's going on --
532	and believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on --
536	once we figure out what's going on,
537	we're really going to be able to have a lot of control
540	over what we do with our health,
542	with what we do with future generations,
545	and how long we're going to live.
547	And hopefully we'll be able to use this
549	to discover more truth, and more beauty.
552	(Music)
566	But it's really quite amazing that these cells, these micro-machines,
571	are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding.
576	They work together. They make the cell do what it needs to do.
580	And their working together helps our bodies --
586	huge entities that they will never see -- function properly.
591	Enjoy the rest of the show. Thank you.
592	(Applause)
