25	Well, it's great to be here.
26	We've heard a lot about the promise of technology, and the peril.
31	I've been quite interested in both.
33	If we could convert 0.03 percent
37	of the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy,
39	we could meet all of our projected needs for 2030.
44	We can't do that today because solar panels are heavy,
47	expensive and very inefficient.
49	There are nano-engineered designs,
52	which at least have been analyzed theoretically,
54	that show the potential to be very lightweight,
56	very inexpensive, very efficient,
58	and we'd be able to actually provide all of our energy needs in this renewable way.
62	Nano-engineered fuel cells
64	could provide the energy where it's needed.
67	That's a key trend, which is decentralization,
69	moving from centralized nuclear power plants and
72	liquid natural gas tankers
74	to decentralized resources that are environmentally more friendly,
78	a lot more efficient
81	and capable and safe from disruption.
85	Bono spoke very eloquently,
87	that we have the tools, for the first time,
91	to address age-old problems of disease and poverty.
95	Most regions of the world are moving in that direction.
99	In 1990, in East Asia and the Pacific region,
103	there were 500 million people living in poverty --
105	that number now is under 200 million.
108	The World Bank projects by 2011, it will be under 20 million,
111	which is a reduction of 95 percent.
114	I did enjoy Bono's comment
117	linking Haight-Ashbury to Silicon Valley.
121	Being from the Massachusetts high-tech community myself,
124	I'd point out that we were hippies also in the 1960s,
129	although we hung around Harvard Square.
132	But we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty,
137	and I'm going to talk about those issues, if we have the will.
140	Kevin Kelly talked about the acceleration of technology.
143	That's been a strong interest of mine,
146	and a theme that I've developed for some 30 years.
149	I realized that my technologies had to make sense when I finished a project.
154	That invariably, the world was a different place
157	when I would introduce a technology.
159	And, I noticed that most inventions fail,
161	not because the R&amp;D department can't get it to work --
164	if you look at most business plans, they will actually succeed
167	if given the opportunity to build what they say they're going to build --
171	and 90 percent of those projects or more will fail, because the timing is wrong --
174	not all the enabling factors will be in place when they're needed.
177	So I began to be an ardent student of technology trends,
181	and track where technology would be at different points in time,
184	and began to build the mathematical models of that.
187	It's kind of taken on a life of its own.
189	I've got a group of 10 people that work with me to gather data
192	on key measures of technology in many different areas, and we build models.
197	And you'll hear people say, well, we can't predict the future.
200	And if you ask me,
202	will the price of Google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now,
205	that's very hard to say.
207	Will WiMax CDMA G3
210	be the wireless standard three years from now? That's hard to say.
212	But if you ask me, what will it cost
214	for one MIPS of computing in 2010,
217	or the cost to sequence a base pair of DNA in 2012,
220	or the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in 2014,
224	it turns out that those are very predictable.
227	There are remarkably smooth exponential curves
229	that govern price performance, capacity, bandwidth.
232	And I'm going to show you a small sample of this,
234	but there's really a theoretical reason
236	why technology develops in an exponential fashion.
241	And a lot of people, when they think about the future, think about it linearly.
243	They think they're going to continue
245	to develop a problem
247	or address a problem using today's tools,
250	at today's pace of progress,
252	and fail to take into consideration this exponential growth.
256	The Genome Project was a controversial project in 1990.
259	We had our best Ph.D. students,
261	our most advanced equipment around the world,
263	we got 1/10,000th of the project done,
265	so how're we going to get this done in 15 years?
267	And 10 years into the project,
271	"the skeptics were still going strong -- says, ""You're two-thirds through this project,"
273	and you've managed to only sequence
275	"a very tiny percentage of the whole genome."""
278	But it's the nature of exponential growth
280	that once it reaches the knee of the curve, it explodes.
282	Most of the project was done in the last
284	few years of the project.
286	It took us 15 years to sequence HIV --
288	we sequenced SARS in 31 days.
290	So we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems.
294	I'm going to show you just a few examples
296	of how pervasive this phenomena is.
299	The actual paradigm-shift rate, the rate of adopting new ideas,
303	is doubling every decade, according to our models.
306	These are all logarithmic graphs,
309	so as you go up the levels it represents, generally multiplying by factor of 10 or 100.
312	It took us half a century to adopt the telephone,
315	the first virtual-reality technology.
318	Cell phones were adopted in about eight years.
320	If you put different communication technologies
323	on this logarithmic graph,
325	television, radio, telephone
327	were adopted in decades.
329	Recent technologies -- like the PC, the web, cell phones --
332	were under a decade.
334	Now this is an interesting chart,
336	and this really gets at the fundamental reason why
338	an evolutionary process -- and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes --
342	accelerate.
344	They work through interaction -- they create a capability,
347	and then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage.
350	So the first step in biological evolution,
353	the evolution of DNA -- actually it was RNA came first --
355	took billions of years,
357	but then evolution used that information-processing backbone
360	to bring on the next stage.
362	So the Cambrian Explosion, when all the body plans of the animals were evolved,
365	took only 10 million years. It was 200 times faster.
369	And then evolution used those body plans
371	to evolve higher cognitive functions,
373	and biological evolution kept accelerating.
375	It's an inherent nature of an evolutionary process.
378	So Homo sapiens, the first technology-creating species,
381	the species that combined a cognitive function
383	with an opposable appendage --
385	and by the way, chimpanzees don't really have a very good opposable thumb --
389	so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip
391	and fine motor coordination,
393	and use our mental models to actually change the world
395	and bring on technology.
397	But anyway, the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years,
400	and then working through interaction,
402	evolution used, essentially,
404	the technology-creating species to bring on the next stage,
407	which were the first steps in technological evolution.
410	And the first step took tens of thousands of years --
413	stone tools, fire, the wheel -- kept accelerating.
416	We always used then the latest generation of technology
418	to create the next generation.
420	Printing press took a century to be adopted;
422	the first computers were designed pen-on-paper -- now we use computers.
426	And we've had a continual acceleration of this process.
429	Now by the way, if you look at this on a linear graph, it looks like everything has just happened,
432	"but some observer says, ""Well, Kurzweil just put points on this graph"
438	"that fall on that straight line."""
440	So, I took 15 different lists from key thinkers,
443	like the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Museum of Natural History, Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar
447	on the same -- and these people were not trying to make my point;
450	these were just lists in reference works,
452	and I think that's what they thought the key events were
455	in biological evolution and technological evolution.
458	And again, it forms the same straight line. You have a little bit of thickening in the line
461	because people do have disagreements, what the key points are,
464	there's differences of opinion when agriculture started,
466	or how long the Cambrian Explosion took.
469	But you see a very clear trend.
471	There's a basic, profound acceleration of this evolutionary process.
476	Information technologies double their capacity, price performance, bandwidth,
481	every year.
483	And that's a very profound explosion of exponential growth.
487	A personal experience, when I was at MIT --
489	computer taking up about the size of this room,
491	less powerful than the computer in your cell phone.
496	But Moore's Law, which is very often identified with this exponential growth,
500	is just one example of many, because it's basically
502	a property of the evolutionary process of technology.
507	I put 49 famous computers on this logarithmic graph --
510	by the way, a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth --
514	that's another exponential.
516	It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900,
519	two years in the middle; we're now doubling it every one year.
523	And that's exponential growth through five different paradigms.
526	Moore's Law was just the last part of that,
528	where we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit,
531	but we had electro-mechanical calculators,
534	relay-based computers that cracked the German Enigma Code,
536	vacuum tubes in the 1950s predicted the election of Eisenhower,
540	discreet transistors used in the first space flights
543	and then Moore's Law.
545	Every time one paradigm ran out of steam,
547	another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth.
550	They were shrinking vacuum tubes, making them smaller and smaller.
553	That hit a wall. They couldn't shrink them and keep the vacuum.
556	Whole different paradigm -- transistors came out of the woodwork.
558	In fact, when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm,
561	it creates research pressure to create the next paradigm.
565	And because we've been predicting the end of Moore's Law
568	for quite a long time -- the first prediction said 2002, until now it says 2022.
571	But by the teen years,
574	the features of transistors will be a few atoms in width,
577	and we won't be able to shrink them any more.
579	That'll be the end of Moore's Law, but it won't be the end of
582	the exponential growth of computing, because chips are flat.
584	We live in a three-dimensional world; we might as well use the third dimension.
587	We will go into the third dimension
589	and there's been tremendous progress, just in the last few years,
592	of getting three-dimensional, self-organizing molecular circuits to work.
596	We'll have those ready well before Moore's Law runs out of steam.
603	Supercomputers -- same thing.
606	Processor performance on Intel chips,
609	the average price of a transistor --
615	You could buy 10 million in 2002.
618	It's pretty remarkable how smooth
621	an exponential process that is.
623	I mean, you'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment,
627	but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior --
630	countries accusing each other of dumping products,
632	IPOs, bankruptcies, marketing programs.
634	You would think it would be a very erratic process,
637	and you have a very smooth
639	outcome of this chaotic process.
641	Just as we can't predict
643	what one molecule in a gas will do --
645	it's hopeless to predict a single molecule --
648	yet we can predict the properties of the whole gas,
650	using thermodynamics, very accurately.
653	It's the same thing here. We can't predict any particular project,
656	but the result of this whole worldwide,
658	chaotic, unpredictable activity of competition
663	and the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable.
666	And we can predict these trends far into the future.
671	Unlike Gertrude Stein's roses,
673	it's not the case that a transistor is a transistor.
675	As we make them smaller and less expensive,
677	the electrons have less distance to travel.
679	They're faster, so you've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors,
683	so the cost of a cycle of one transistor
687	has been coming down with a halving rate of 1.1 years.
690	You add other forms of innovation and processor design,
693	you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year.
697	And that's basically deflation --
702	And it's not just computers. I mean, it's true of DNA sequencing;
705	it's true of brain scanning;
707	it's true of the World Wide Web. I mean, anything that we can quantify,
709	we have hundreds of different measurements
712	of different, information-related measurements --
715	capacity, adoption rates --
717	and they basically double every 12, 13, 15 months,
720	depending on what you're looking at.
722	In terms of price performance, that's a 40 to 50 percent deflation rate.
727	And economists have actually started worrying about that. 
729	We had deflation during the Depression,
731	but that was collapse of the money supply,
733	collapse of consumer confidence, a completely different phenomena.
736	This is due to greater productivity,
739	"but the economist says, ""But there's no way you're going to be able to keep up with that."
741	If you have 50 percent deflation, people may increase their volume
746	But what we're actually seeing is that
748	we actually more than keep up with it.
750	We've had 28 percent per year compounded growth in dollars
753	in information technology over the last 50 years.
756	I mean, people didn't build iPods for 10,000 dollars 10 years ago.
760	As the price performance makes new applications feasible,
763	new applications come to the market.
765	And this is a very widespread phenomena.
768	Magnetic data storage --
770	that's not Moore's Law, it's shrinking magnetic spots,
773	different engineers, different companies, same exponential process.
777	A key revolution is that we're understanding our own biology
781	in these information terms.
783	We're understanding the software programs
785	that make our body run.
787	These were evolved in very different times --
789	we'd like to actually change those programs.
791	One little software program, called the fat insulin receptor gene,
793	"basically says, ""Hold onto every calorie,"
795	"because the next hunting season may not work out so well."""
799	That was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago.
802	We'd like to actually turn that program off.
805	They tried that in animals, and these mice ate ravenously
808	and remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim.
810	They didn't get diabetes; they didn't get heart disease;
813	they lived 20 percent longer; they got the health benefits of caloric restriction
816	without the restriction.
818	Four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this,
821	felt that would be
824	interesting drug for the human market,
827	and that's just one of the 30,000 genes
829	that affect our biochemistry.
832	We were evolved in an era where it wasn't in the interests of people
835	at the age of most people at this conference, like myself,
838	to live much longer, because we were using up the precious resources
842	which were better deployed towards the children
843	and those caring for them.
845	So, life -- long lifespans --
847	like, that is to say, much more than 30 --
849	weren't selected for,
852	but we are learning to actually manipulate
855	and change these software programs
857	through the biotechnology revolution.
859	For example, we can inhibit genes now with RNA interference.
863	There are exciting new forms of gene therapy
865	that overcome the problem of placing the genetic material
867	in the right place on the chromosome.
869	There's actually a -- for the first time now,
872	something going to human trials, that actually cures pulmonary hypertension --
875	a fatal disease -- using gene therapy.
878	So we'll have not just designer babies, but designer baby boomers.
881	And this technology is also accelerating.
884	It cost 10 dollars per base pair in 1990,
887	then a penny in 2000.
889	It's now under a 10th of a cent.
891	The amount of genetic data --
893	basically this shows that smooth exponential growth
896	doubled every year,
898	enabling the genome project to be completed.
901	Another major revolution: the communications revolution.
904	The price performance, bandwidth, capacity of communications measured many different ways;
909	wired, wireless is growing exponentially.
912	The Internet has been doubling in power and continues to,
915	measured many different ways.
917	This is based on the number of hosts.
919	Miniaturization -- we're shrinking the size of technology
921	at an exponential rate,
923	both wired and wireless.
925	These are some designs from Eric Drexler's book --
929	which we're now showing are feasible
931	with super-computing simulations,
933	where actually there are scientists building
935	molecule-scale robots.
937	One has one that actually walks with a surprisingly human-like gait,
939	that's built out of molecules.
942	There are little machines doing things in experimental bases.
946	The most exciting opportunity
949	is actually to go inside the human body
951	and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions.
954	And this is less futuristic than it may sound.
956	These things have already been done in animals.
958	There's one nano-engineered device that cures type 1 diabetes. It's blood cell-sized.
962	They put tens of thousands of these
964	in the blood cell -- they tried this in rats --
966	it lets insulin out in a controlled fashion,
968	and actually cures type 1 diabetes.
970	What you're watching is a design
973	of a robotic red blood cell,
975	and it does bring up the issue that our biology
977	is actually very sub-optimal,
979	even though it's remarkable in its intricacy.
982	Once we understand its principles of operation,
985	and the pace with which we are reverse-engineering biology is accelerating,
989	we can actually design these things to be
991	thousands of times more capable.
993	An analysis of this respirocyte, designed by Rob Freitas,
998	indicates if you replace 10 percent of your red blood cells with these robotic versions,
1001	you could do an Olympic sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath.
1004	You could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours --
1007	"so, ""Honey, I'm in the pool,"" will take on a whole new meaning."
1011	It will be interesting to see what we do in our Olympic trials.
1013	Presumably we'll ban them,
1015	but then we'll have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gyms
1017	routinely out-performing the Olympic athletes.
1022	Freitas has a design for a robotic white blood cell.
1025	These are 2020-circa scenarios,
1029	but they're not as futuristic as it may sound.
1031	There are four major conferences on building blood cell-sized devices;
1035	there are many experiments in animals.
1037	There's actually one going into human trial,
1039	so this is feasible technology.
1043	If we come back to our exponential growth of computing,
1045	1,000 dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain.
1048	It will intersect human intelligence
1051	in terms of capacity in the 2020s,
1054	but that'll be the hardware side of the equation.
1056	Where will we get the software?
1058	Well, it turns out we can see inside the human brain,
1060	and in fact not surprisingly,
1062	the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year.
1066	And with the new generation of scanning tools,
1068	for the first time we can actually see
1070	individual inter-neural fibers
1072	and see them processing and signaling in real time --
1075	but then the question is, OK, we can get this data now,
1077	but can we understand it?
1079	Doug Hofstadter wonders, well, maybe our intelligence
1082	just isn't great enough to understand our intelligence,
1085	and if we were smarter, well, then our brains would be that much more complicated,
1088	and we'd never catch up to it.
1091	It turns out that we can understand it.
1094	This is a block diagram of
1097	a model and simulation of the human auditory cortex
1101	that actually works quite well --
1103	in applying psychoacoustic tests, gets very similar results to human auditory perception.
1107	There's another simulation of the cerebellum --
1110	that's more than half the neurons in the brain --
1112	again, works very similarly to human skill formation.
1116	This is at an early stage, but you can show
1119	with the exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain
1122	and the exponential improvement
1124	in the resolution of brain scanning,
1126	we will succeed in reverse-engineering the human brain
1129	by the 2020s.
1131	We've already had very good models and simulation of about 15 regions
1134	out of the several hundred.
1137	All of this is driving
1139	exponentially growing economic progress.
1141	We've had productivity go from 30 dollars to 150 dollars per hour
1146	of labor in the last 50 years.
1148	E-commerce has been growing exponentially. It's now a trillion dollars.
1151	You might wonder, well, wasn't there a boom and a bust?
1153	That was strictly a capital-markets phenomena.
1155	Wall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology, which it was,
1159	but then six months later, when it hadn't revolutionized all business models,
1162	they figured, well, that was wrong,
1164	and then we had this bust.
1167	All right, this is a technology
1169	that we put together using some of the technologies we're involved in.
1172	This will be a routine feature in a cell phone.
1176	It would be able to translate from one language to another.
1188	So let me just end with a couple of scenarios.
1190	By 2010 computers will disappear.
1194	They'll be so small, they'll be embedded in our clothing, in our environment.
1197	Images will be written directly to our retina,
1199	providing full-immersion virtual reality,
1201	augmented real reality. We'll be interacting with virtual personalities.
1205	But if we go to 2029, we really have the full maturity of these trends,
1209	and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw
1212	in terms of generations of technology, which are getting faster and faster, we'll have at that point.
1216	I mean, we will have two-to-the-25th-power
1218	greater price performance, capacity and bandwidth
1221	of these technologies, which is pretty phenomenal.
1223	It'll be millions of times more powerful than it is today.
1225	We'll have completed the reverse-engineering of the human brain,
1228	1,000 dollars of computing will be far more powerful
1231	than the human brain in terms of basic raw capacity.
1235	Computers will combine
1237	the subtle pan-recognition powers
1239	of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already superior,
1242	in terms of doing analytic thinking,
1244	remembering billions of facts accurately.
1246	Machines can share their knowledge very quickly.
1248	But it's not just an alien invasion of intelligent machines.
1253	We are going to merge with our technology.
1255	These nano-bots I mentioned
1257	will first be used for medical and health applications:
1261	cleaning up the environment, providing powerful fuel cells
1264	and widely distributed decentralized solar panels and so on in the environment.
1269	But they'll also go inside our brain,
1271	interact with our biological neurons.
1273	We've demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this.
1276	So, for example,
1278	full-immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system,
1280	the nano-bots shut down the signals coming from your real senses,
1283	replace them with the signals that your brain would be receiving
1286	if you were in the virtual environment,
1288	and then it'll feel like you're in that virtual environment.
1290	You can go there with other people, have any kind of experience
1292	with anyone involving all of the senses.
1295	"""Experience beamers,"" I call them, will put their whole flow of sensory experiences"
1298	in the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the Internet.
1301	You can plug in and experience what it's like to be someone else.
1304	But most importantly,
1306	it'll be a tremendous expansion
1308	of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology,
1312	which in some sense we're doing already.
1314	We routinely do intellectual feats
1316	that would be impossible without our technology.
1318	Human life expectancy is expanding. It was 37 in 1800,
1321	and with this sort of biotechnology, nano-technology revolutions,
1326	this will move up very rapidly
1328	in the years ahead.
1330	My main message is that progress in technology
1334	is exponential, not linear.
1337	Many -- even scientists -- assume a linear model,
1341	"so they'll say, ""Oh, it'll be hundreds of years"
1343	before we have self-replicating nano-technology assembly
1346	"or artificial intelligence."""
1348	If you really look at the power of exponential growth,
1351	you'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand.
1354	And information technology is increasingly encompassing
1357	all of our lives, from our music to our manufacturing
1361	to our biology to our energy to materials.
1365	We'll be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the 2020s,
1368	from information, in very inexpensive raw materials,
1370	using nano-technology.
1373	These are very powerful technologies.
1375	They both empower our promise and our peril.
1379	So we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems.
1382	Thank you very much.
