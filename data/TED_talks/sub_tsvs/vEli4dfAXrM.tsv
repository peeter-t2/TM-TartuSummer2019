16.26	In 1994, I walked into a prison in Cambodia,
20.26	and I met a 12-year-old boy
23.26	who had been tortured
25.26	and was denied access to counsel.
27.26	And as I looked into his eyes, I realized
29.26	that for the hundreds of letters I had written
31.26	for political prisoners, that I would never have
34.26	written a letter for him,
36.26	because he was not a 12-year-old boy who
38.26	had done something important for anybody.
40.26	He was not a political prisoner.
42.26	He was a 12-year-old boy who had
44.26	stolen a bicycle.
46.26	What I also realized at that point was that
48.26	it was not only Cambodia, but
50.26	of the 113
52.26	developing countries that torture,
57.26	that say you have a right to a lawyer
59.26	and you have a right not to be tortured.
62.26	And what I recognized was that there was an
64.26	incredible window of opportunity for us
66.26	as a world community to come together
69.26	and end torture as an investigative tool.
72.26	We often think of torture as being
74.26	political torture or reserved for
76.26	just the worst, but, in fact,
81.26	is not for political prisoners.
83.26	It is for people who are
85.26	in broken-down legal systems,
87.26	and unfortunately because torture is
89.26	the cheapest form of investigation --
91.26	it's cheaper than having a legal system,
93.26	cheaper than having a lawyer
95.26	and early access to counsel --
97.26	it is what happens most of the time.
99.26	I believe today that it is possible for us
101.26	as a world community, if we make a decision,
104.26	to come together and end torture
106.26	as an investigative tool in our lifetime,
109.26	but it will require three things.
111.26	First is the training, empowerment,
114.26	and connection of defenders worldwide.
117.26	The second is insuring that there is
120.26	systematic early access to counsel.
123.26	And the third is commitment.
126.26	So in the year 2000,
128.26	I began to wonder,
131.26	what if we came together?
134.26	Could we do something
136.26	for these 93 countries?
138.26	And I founded International Bridges to Justice
140.26	which has a specific mission of
142.26	ending torture as an investigative tool
145.26	and implementing due process rights
147.26	in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers
150.26	at an early stage in police stations
152.26	and in courtrooms.
154.26	My first experiences, though, did come
156.26	from Cambodia, and at the time I remember
159.26	first coming to Cambodia and there were,
161.26	in 1994, still less than
165.26	the Khmer Rouge had killed them all.
167.26	And even 20 years later, there was only
171.26	you'd walk into a prison and
173.26	not only would you meet 12-year-old boys,
175.26	you'd meet women and you'd say,
177.26	"""Why are you here?"" Women would say,"
179.26	"""Well I've been here for 10 years because"
181.26	"my husband committed a crime, but they can't find him."""
183.26	So it's just a place where there was no rule of law.
186.26	The first group of defenders came together
188.26	and I still remember, as I was training, I said,
190.26	"""Okay, what do you do for an investigation?"""
192.26	And there was silence in the class, and finally
194.26	one woman stood up, [inaudible name],
196.26	"and she said ""Khrew,"" which means ""teacher."""
199.26	"She said, ""I have defended more than"
202.26	a hundred people, and I've never had to do
205.26	any investigation,
207.26	"because they all come with confessions."""
209.26	And we talked about, as a class, the fact that
212.26	number one, the confessions
214.26	might not be reliable, but number two,
216.26	we did not want to encourage the police
218.26	to keep doing this, especially
220.26	as it was now against the law.
222.26	And it took a lot of courage for these
224.26	defenders to decide that they would
226.26	begin to stand up and support each other
228.26	in implementing these laws.
231.26	And I still remember the first cases where
233.26	they came, all 25 together, she would
235.26	stand up, and they were in the back, and
237.26	they would support her, and the judges kept
239.26	"saying, ""No, no, no, no, we're going to do things"
241.26	"the exact same way we've been doing them."""
243.26	But one day the perfect case came, and it
245.26	was a woman who was a vegetable seller,
247.26	she was sitting outside of a house.
249.26	She said she actually saw the person
252.26	run out who she thinks stole
254.26	whatever the jewelry was, but the police
256.26	came, they got her, there was nothing on her.
258.26	She was pregnant at the time. She had
260.26	cigarette burns on her. She'd miscarried.
262.26	And when they brought her case
264.26	to the judge, for the first time he stood up
266.26	"and he said, ""Yes, there's no evidence"
268.26	except for your torture confession
270.26	"and you will be released."""
272.26	And the defenders began to take cases
274.26	over and over again and
276.26	you will see, they have step by step began
279.26	to change the course of history in Cambodia.
282.26	But Cambodia is not alone.
284.26	I used to think, well is it Cambodia?
286.26	Or is it other countries?
288.26	But it is in so many countries.
291.26	In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn't
293.26	a 12-year-old boy, it was an 8-year-old boy
296.26	for stealing a mobile phone.
298.26	Or a woman, I picked up her baby,
300.26	"really cute baby, I said ""Your baby is so cute."""
303.26	It wasn't a baby, she was three.
305.26	"And she said ""Yeah, but she's why I'm here,"""
307.26	because she was accused of stealing
309.26	two diapers and an iron for her baby and
311.26	still had been in prison.
313.26	And when I walked up to the prison director,
315.26	"I said, ""You've got to let her out."
317.26	"A judge would let her out."""
319.26	"And he said, ""Okay, we can talk about it,"
321.26	but look at my prison. Eighty percent
323.26	of the two thousand people here
325.26	"are without a lawyer. What can we do?"""
327.26	So lawyers began to courageously
329.26	stand up together to organize a system
332.26	where they can take cases.
334.26	But we realized that it's not only the training
336.26	of the lawyers, but the connection
338.26	of the lawyers that makes a difference.
340.26	For example, in Cambodia, it was that
342.26	[inaudible name] did not go alone
344.26	but she had 24 lawyers with her
346.26	who stood up together. And in the same way,
348.26	in China, they always tell me,
350.26	"""It's like a fresh wind in the desert"
352.26	"when we can come together."""
354.26	Or in Zimbabwe, where I remember Innocent,
356.26	after coming out of a prison where everybody
358.26	"stood up and said, ""I've been here"
360.26	for one year, eight years, 12 years
362.26	"without a lawyer,"""
364.26	he came and we had a training together
366.26	"and he said, ""I have heard it said"" --"
369.26	because he had heard people mumbling
371.26	"and grumbling -- ""I have heard it said that"
373.26	we cannot help to create justice
376.26	"because we do not have the resources."""
378.26	"And then he said, ""But I want you to know"
380.26	that the lack of resources
383.26	"is never an excuse for injustice."""
385.26	And with that, he successfully
387.26	organized 68 lawyers who have been
390.26	systematically taking the cases.
392.26	The key that we see, though, is training
395.26	and then early access.
397.26	I was recently in Egypt, and was inspired
399.26	to meet with another group of lawyers,
401.26	and what they told me is that they said,
403.26	"""Hey, look, we don't have police"
405.26	on the streets now. The police are
407.26	one of the main reasons why we had
409.26	the revolution. They were torturing everybody
411.26	"all the time."""
413.26	"And I said, ""But there's been tens of millions"
415.26	of dollars that have recently gone in
417.26	to the development of the legal system here.
419.26	"What's going on?"""
421.26	I met with one of the development agencies,
424.26	and they were training prosecutors
426.26	and judges, which is the normal bias,
428.26	as opposed to defenders.
430.26	And they showed me a manual which
432.26	actually was an excellent manual.
434.26	"I said, ""I'm gonna copy this."""
436.26	It had everything in it. Lawyers can come
438.26	at the police station. It was perfect.
440.26	Prosecutors were perfectly trained.
442.26	"But I said to them, ""I just have one question,"
444.26	which is, by the time that everybody got to
446.26	"the prosecutor's office, what had happened to them?"""
448.26	And after a pause, they said,
450.26	"""They had been tortured."""
452.26	So the pieces are,
454.26	not only the training of the lawyers, but
456.26	us finding a way to systematically implement
459.26	early access to counsel, because they are
462.26	the safeguard in the system
464.26	for people who are being tortured.
467.26	And as I tell you this, I'm also aware of the
469.26	"fact that it sounds like, ""Oh, okay, it sounds"
471.26	"like we could do it, but can we really do it?"""
474.26	Because it sounds big.
476.26	And there are many reasons why I believe it's possible.
479.26	The first reason is the people on the ground
482.26	who find ways of creating miracles
485.26	because of their commitment.
487.26	It's not only Innocent, who I told you about
490.26	in Zimbabwe, but defenders all over the world
493.26	who are looking for these pieces.
496.26	We have a program called JusticeMakers,
499.26	and we realized there are people that are
501.26	courageous and want to do things, but
503.26	how can we support them?
505.26	So it's an online contest where it's only
507.26	five thousand dollars if you come up with
509.26	and innovative way of implementing justice.
511.26	And there are 30 JusticeMakers
513.26	throughout the world, from Sri Lanka
515.26	to Swaziland to the DRC, who with
518.26	five thousand dollars do amazing things,
521.26	through SMS programs,
523.26	through paralegal programs,
525.26	through whatever they can do.
527.26	And it's not only these JusticeMakers,
531.26	but people we courageously see
533.26	figure out who their networks are
536.26	and how they can move it forward.
538.26	So in China, for instance, great laws
540.26	came out where it says police cannot
543.26	torture people or they will be punished.
546.26	And I was sitting side by side with one of our
549.26	very courageous lawyers, and said,
552.26	"""How can we get this out? How can we"
554.26	make sure that this is implemented?
556.26	"This is fantastic."" And he said to me,"
558.26	"""Well, do you have money?"" And I said,"
560.26	"""No."" And he said, ""That's okay,"
562.26	"we can still figure it out."""
564.26	And on December 4, he organized
566.26	three thousand members
568.26	of the Youth Communist League,
570.26	from 14 of the top law schools,
572.26	who organized themselves, developed
574.26	posters with the new laws, and went
576.26	to the police stations and began what he says
578.26	is a non-violent legal revolution
581.26	to protect citizen rights.
584.26	So I talked about the fact that we need
586.26	to train and support defenders.
588.26	We need to systematically implement
590.26	early access to counsel.
592.26	But the third and most important thing is that
594.26	we make a commitment to this.
596.26	"And people often say to me, ""You know,"
598.26	this is great, but it's wildly idealistic.
600.26	"Never going to happen."""
602.26	And the reason that I think that
604.26	those words are interesting is because
606.26	those were the same kinds of words
608.26	that were used for people who decided
610.26	they would end slavery, or end apartheid.
612.26	It began with a small group of people
614.26	who decided they would commit.
616.26	Now, there's one of our favorite poems
618.26	from the defenders, which they share
620.26	from each other, is:
622.26	"""Take courage friends, the road is often long,"
624.26	the path is never clear,
626.26	and the stakes are very high,
628.26	"but deep down, you are not alone."""
630.26	And I believe that if we can come together
633.26	as a world community to support not only
635.26	defenders, but also everyone in the system
638.26	who is looking towards it,
640.26	we can end torture as an investigative tool.
643.26	I end always, because I'm sure the questions are --
645.26	and I'd be happy to talk to you
647.26	"at any point -- ""But what can I really do?"""
649.26	Well, I would say this. First of all,
651.26	you know what you can do. But second of all,
653.26	I would leave you with the story of Vishna,
655.26	who actually was my inspiration
658.26	for starting International Bridges to Justice.
660.26	Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him
663.26	who was born in a Cambodian prison
665.26	in Kandal Province. But because he was
668.26	born in the prison, everybody loved him,
670.26	including the guards, so he was the only one
672.26	who was allowed to come
674.26	in and out of the bars.
676.26	So, you know, there's bars. And by the time
678.26	that Vishna was getting bigger,
680.26	which means what gets bigger? Your head gets bigger.
682.26	So he would come to the first bar,
684.26	the second bar and then the third bar,
686.26	and then really slowly move his head
688.26	so he could fit through, and come back,
690.26	third, second, first. And he would
692.26	grab my pinkie, because what he wanted
694.26	to do every day is he wanted to go visit.
696.26	You know, he never quite made it to
698.26	all of them every day, but he wanted to visit
700.26	all 156 prisoners. And I would lift him,
702.26	and he would put his fingers through.
704.26	Or if they were dark cells, it was like iron
706.26	corrugated, and he would put his fingers through.
708.26	And most of the prisoners said that he was
710.26	their greatest joy and their sunshine, and they
712.26	looked forward to him. And I was like,
714.26	here's Vishna. He's a 4-year-old boy.
716.26	He was born in a prison with almost nothing,
718.26	no material goods, but he had a sense of
720.26	his own heroic journey, which I believe
722.26	we are all born into. He said,
724.26	"""Probably I can't do everything."
726.26	But I'm one. I can do something.
728.26	"And I will do the one thing that I can do."""
730.26	So I thank you for having the prophetic
732.26	imagination to imagine the shaping
735.26	of a new world with us together,
737.26	and invite you into this journey with us.
739.26	Thank you.
741.26	(Applause)
749.26	Thank you.
751.26	(Applause)
753.26	Thank you.
755.26	(Applause)
