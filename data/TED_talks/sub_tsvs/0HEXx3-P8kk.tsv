16.26	I would like to share with you this morning
19.26	some stories about the ocean
21.26	through my work as a still photographer
23.26	for National Geographic magazine.
26.26	I guess I became an underwater photographer
28.26	and a photojournalist
30.26	because I fell in love with the sea as a child.
32.26	And I wanted to tell stories
34.26	about all the amazing things I was seeing underwater,
37.26	incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors.
40.26	And after even 30 years of doing this,
42.26	after 30 years of exploring the ocean,
44.26	I never cease to be amazed
46.26	at the extraordinary encounters that I have while I'm at sea.
49.26	But more and more frequently these days
51.26	I'm seeing terrible things underwater as well,
53.26	things that I don't think most people realize.
56.26	And I've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues
59.26	to tell a more complete story.
61.26	I want people to see what's happening underwater,
63.26	both the horror and the magic.
66.26	The first story that I did for National Geographic,
68.26	where I recognized the ability to include
70.26	environmental issues within a natural history coverage,
73.26	was a story I proposed on harp seals.
76.26	The story I wanted to do initially
78.26	was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year
81.26	where these animals migrate down from the Canadian arctic
84.26	to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada
86.26	to engage in courtship, mating and to have their pups.
89.26	And all of this is played out against
91.26	the backdrop of transient pack ice
93.26	that moves with wind and tide.
95.26	And because I'm an underwater photographer,
97.26	I wanted to do this story from both above and below,
99.26	to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups
102.26	making its very first swim in the icy 29-degree water.
105.26	But as I got more involved in the story,
107.26	I realized that there were two big environmental issues I couldn't ignore.
110.26	The first was that these animals continue to be hunted,
113.26	killed with hakapiks at about eight, 15 days old.
116.26	It actually is the largest marine mammal
118.26	slaughter on the planet,
120.26	with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year.
123.26	But as disturbing as that is,
125.26	I think the bigger problem for harp seals
127.26	is the loss of sea ice due to global warming.
129.26	This is an aerial picture that I made that shows
131.26	the Gulf of St. Lawrence during harp seal season.
134.26	And even though we see a lot of ice in this picture,
136.26	there's a lot of water as well, which wasn't there historically.
139.26	And the ice that is there is quite thin.
142.26	The problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice
145.26	in order to nurse from their moms.
147.26	They only need 12 days from the moment they're born until they're on their own.
150.26	But if they don't get 12 days,
152.26	they can fall into the ocean and die.
154.26	This is a photo that I made showing
156.26	one of these pups that's only about five or seven days old --
158.26	still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly --
160.26	that has fallen in because of the thin ice,
162.26	and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe
165.26	and to get it back to stable purchase.
167.26	This problem has continued to grow each year since I was there.
170.26	I read that last year the pup mortality rate
172.26	was 100 percent in parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
175.26	So, clearly, this species has a lot of problems going forward.
178.26	This ended up becoming a cover story at National Geographic.
181.26	And it received quite a bit of attention.
183.26	And with that, I saw the potential to begin
185.26	doing other stories about ocean problems.
187.26	So I proposed a story on the global fish crisis,
190.26	in part because I had personally witnessed
193.26	a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last 30 years,
195.26	but also because I read a scientific paper
197.26	that stated that 90 percent of the big fish in the ocean
200.26	have disappeared in the last 50 or 60 years.
202.26	These are the tuna, the billfish and the sharks.
205.26	When I read that, I was blown away by those numbers.
207.26	I thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet,
210.26	but it really wasn't, so I wanted to do a story
213.26	that was a very different kind of underwater story.
216.26	I wanted it to be more like war photography,
218.26	where I was making harder-hitting pictures
220.26	that showed readers what was happening
222.26	to marine wildlife around the planet.
224.26	The first component of the story that I thought was essential, however,
227.26	was to give readers a sense of appreciation
230.26	for the ocean animals that they were eating.
232.26	You know, I think people go into a restaurant,
234.26	and somebody orders a steak, and we all know where steak comes from,
237.26	and somebody orders a chicken, and we know what a chicken is,
240.26	but when they're eating bluefin sushi,
242.26	do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they're consuming?
245.26	These are the lions and tigers of the sea.
248.26	In reality, these animals have no terrestrial counterpart;
250.26	they're unique in the world.
252.26	These are animals that can practically swim
254.26	from the equator to the poles
256.26	and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year.
259.26	If we weren't so efficient at catching them, because they grow their entire life,
262.26	would have 30-year-old bluefin out there that weigh a ton.
264.26	But the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them,
267.26	and their stocks have collapsed worldwide.
269.26	This is the daily auction at the Tsukiji Fish Market
271.26	that I photographed a couple years ago.
273.26	And every single day these tuna, bluefin like this,
276.26	are stacked up like cordwood,
278.26	just warehouse after warehouse.
280.26	As I wandered around and made these pictures,
282.26	it sort of occurred to me that the ocean's not a grocery store, you know.
285.26	We can't keep taking without expecting
287.26	serious consequences as a result.
290.26	I also, with the story, wanted to show readers
292.26	how fish are caught, some of the methods that are used to catch fish,
295.26	like a bottom trawler, which is one of the most common methods in the world.
298.26	This was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp,
301.26	but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world.
304.26	You have a large net in the middle
306.26	with two steel doors on either end.
308.26	And as this assembly is towed through the water,
310.26	the doors meet resistance with the ocean,
312.26	and it opens the mouth of the net,
314.26	and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom.
317.26	And this just drags over the bottom, in this case to catch shrimp.
320.26	But as you can imagine, it's catching everything else in its path as well.
323.26	And it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom,
326.26	things like sponges and corals,
328.26	that critical habitat for other animals.
330.26	This photograph I made of the fisherman
333.26	holding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour.
336.26	So he had a handful of shrimp, maybe seven or eight shrimp,
338.26	and all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch.
341.26	These are animals that died in the process,
343.26	but have no commercial value.
345.26	So this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner,
347.26	maybe seven or eight shrimp
349.26	and 10 pounds of other animals that had to die in the process.
352.26	And to make that point even more visual, I swam under the shrimp boat
355.26	and made this picture of the guy shoveling
357.26	this bycatch into the sea as trash
359.26	and photographed this cascade of death,
361.26	you know, animals like guitarfish, bat rays,
364.26	flounder, pufferfish, that only an hour before,
367.26	were on the bottom of the ocean, alive,
369.26	but now being thrown back as trash.
371.26	I also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry
374.26	because, currently on planet Earth,
376.26	we're killing over 100 million sharks
378.26	every single year.
380.26	But before I went out to photograph this component,
382.26	I sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark
385.26	that will resonate with readers
387.26	You know, I think there's still a lot of people out there who think
389.26	the only good shark is a dead shark.
391.26	But this one morning I jumped in and found this thresher
393.26	that had just recently died in the gill net.
395.26	And with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible,
398.26	it struck me as sort of a crucifixion, if you will.
401.26	This ended up being the lead picture
403.26	in the global fishery story in National Geographic.
405.26	And I hope that it helped readers to take notice
407.26	of this problem of 100 million sharks.
410.26	And because I love sharks -- I'm somewhat obsessed with sharks --
413.26	I wanted to do another, more celebratory, story about sharks,
415.26	as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation.
418.26	So I went to the Bahamas
420.26	because there're very few places in the world
422.26	where sharks are doing well these days,
424.26	but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy,
427.26	largely due to the fact that the government there
430.26	had outlawed longlining several years ago.
432.26	And I wanted to show several species
434.26	that we hadn't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations.
437.26	One of the locations was this place called Tiger Beach,
440.26	in the northern Bahamas where tiger sharks
442.26	aggregate in shallow water.
444.26	This is a low-altitude photograph that I made
446.26	showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks
449.26	sort of just swimming around behind.
451.26	But the one thing I definitely didn't want to do with this coverage
454.26	was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters.
457.26	I didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary.
460.26	And with this photograph of a beautiful
464.26	female tiger shark,
466.26	I sort of think I got to that goal,
469.26	where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose,
472.26	and my strobe created a shadow on her face.
474.26	And I think it's a gentler picture, a little less threatening,
476.26	a little more respectful of the species.
478.26	I also searched on this story
480.26	for the elusive great hammerhead,
482.26	an animal that really hadn't been photographed much
484.26	until maybe about seven or 10 years ago.
486.26	It's a very solitary creature.
488.26	But this is an animal that's considered data deficient by science
491.26	in both Florida and in the Bahamas.
493.26	You know, we know almost nothing about them.
495.26	We don't know where they migrate to or from,
497.26	where they mate, where they have their pups,
499.26	and yet, hammerhead populations in the Atlantic
501.26	have declined about 80 percent in the last 20 to 30 years.
504.26	You know, we're losing them faster than we can possibly find them.
507.26	This is the oceanic whitetip shark,
510.26	an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species,
512.26	if you pay attention to such lists.
514.26	But it's an animal that's about 98 percent in decline
517.26	throughout most of its range.
519.26	Because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water,
522.26	and because we weren't working on the bottom,
524.26	I brought along a shark cage here,
526.26	and my friend, shark biologist Wes Pratt is inside the cage.
529.26	You'll see that the photographer, of course, was not inside the cage here,
532.26	so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer I guess.
535.26	And lastly with this story,
537.26	I also wanted to focus on baby sharks, shark nurseries.
540.26	And I went to the island of Bimini, in the Bahamas,
543.26	to work with lemon shark pups.
545.26	This is a photo of a lemon shark pup,
547.26	and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives
550.26	in these protective mangroves.
552.26	This is a very sort of un-shark-like photograph.
555.26	It's not what you typically might think of as a shark picture.
558.26	But, you know, here we see a shark that's maybe 10 or 11 inches long
561.26	swimming in about a foot of water.
563.26	But this is crucial habitat and it's where they spend the first two, three years of their lives,
566.26	until they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef.
569.26	After I left Bimini, I actually learned
571.26	that this habitat was being bulldozed
573.26	to create a new golf course and resort.
576.26	And other recent stories have looked at
578.26	single, flagship species, if you will,
580.26	that are at risk in the ocean
582.26	as a way of talking about other threats.
585.26	One such story I did documented the leatherback sea turtle.
588.26	This is the largest, widest-ranging,
590.26	deepest-diving and oldest of all turtle species.
593.26	Here we see a female crawling
595.26	out of the ocean under moonlight
597.26	on the island of Trinidad.
599.26	These are animals whose lineage dates back about 100 million years.
602.26	And there was a time in their lifespan
604.26	where they were coming out of the water to nest
606.26	and saw Tyrannosaurus rex running by.
608.26	And today, they crawl out and see condominiums.
611.26	But despite this amazing longevity,
613.26	they're now considered critically endangered.
616.26	In the Pacific, where I made this photograph,
618.26	their stocks have declined about 90 percent
620.26	in the last 15 years.
622.26	This is a photograph that shows a hatchling
625.26	about to taste saltwater for the very first time
627.26	beginning this long and perilous journey.
629.26	Only one in a thousand
631.26	leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity.
633.26	But that's due to natural predators
635.26	like vultures that pick them off on a beach
637.26	or predatory fish that are waiting offshore.
640.26	Nature has learned to compensate with that,
642.26	and females have multiple clutches of eggs
644.26	to overcome those odds.
646.26	But what they can't deal with is anthropogenic stresses,
649.26	human things, like this picture that shows
651.26	a leatherback caught at night in a gill net.
654.26	I actually jumped in and photographed this,
656.26	and with the fisherman's permission,
658.26	I cut the turtle out, and it was able to swim free.
660.26	But, you know, thousands of other leatherbacks each year
663.26	are not so fortunate,
665.26	and the species' future is in great danger.
667.26	Another charismatic megafauna species that I worked with
670.26	is the story I did on the right whale.
672.26	And essentially, the story is this with right whales,
674.26	that about a million years ago, there was
676.26	one species of right whale on the planet,
678.26	but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated,
681.26	the species sort of separated,
683.26	and today we have essentially two distinct stocks.
685.26	We have the Southern right whale that we see here
687.26	and the North Atlantic right whale that we see here
690.26	with a mom and calf off the coast of Florida.
692.26	Now, both species were hunted to the brink of extinction
694.26	by the early whalers,
696.26	but the Southern right whales have rebounded a lot better
698.26	because they're located in places
700.26	farther away from human activity.
702.26	The North Atlantic right whale is listed as
704.26	the most endangered species on the planet today
706.26	because they are urban whales; they live along the east coast
709.26	of North America, United States and Canada,
711.26	and they have to deal with all these urban ills.
714.26	This photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of Florida.
717.26	You can see the coal burning plant in the background.
720.26	They have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals
722.26	that are flushed out into the ocean,
724.26	and maybe even affecting their reproduction.
726.26	They also get entangled in fishing gear.
728.26	This is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale.
731.26	And those white markings are not natural markings.
733.26	These are entanglement scars.
738.26	but most don't shed the gear, things like lobster traps and crab pots.
741.26	They hold on to them, and it eventually kills them.
744.26	And the other problem is they get hit by ships.
746.26	And this was an animal that was struck by a ship
748.26	in Nova Scotia, Canada
750.26	being towed in, where they did a necropsy
752.26	to confirm the cause of death,
754.26	which was indeed a ship strike.
756.26	So all of these ills are stacking up against these animals
759.26	and keeping their numbers very low.
761.26	And to draw a contrast with that beleaguered North Atlantic population,
764.26	I went to a new pristine population of Southern right whales
767.26	that had only been discovered about 10 years ago
769.26	in the sub-Antarctic of New Zealand, a place called the Auckland Islands.
772.26	I went down there in the winter time.
774.26	And these are animals that had never seen humans before,
776.26	and I was one of the first people they probably had ever seen.
778.26	And I got in the water with them,
780.26	and I was amazed at how curious they were.
782.26	This photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about 70 feet
785.26	and one of these amazingly beautiful, 45-foot,
790.26	like a city bus just swimming up, you know.
792.26	They were in perfect condition,
794.26	very fat and healthy, robust, no entanglement scars,
797.26	the way they're supposed to look.
799.26	You know, I read that the pilgrims, when they landed at Plymouth Rock
801.26	in Massachusetts in 1620,
803.26	wrote that you could walk across Cape Cod Bay
805.26	on the backs of right whales.
807.26	And we can't go back and see that today,
809.26	but maybe we can preserve what we have left.
811.26	And I wanted to close this program with a story of hope,
814.26	a story I did on marine reserves
816.26	as sort of a solution
818.26	to the problem of overfishing, the global fish crisis story.
821.26	I settled on working in the country of New Zealand
823.26	because New Zealand was rather progressive,
825.26	and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean.
828.26	And I really wanted this story to be about three things:
830.26	I wanted it to be about abundance,
832.26	about diversity and about resilience.
834.26	And one of the first places I worked
836.26	was a reserve called Goat Island
838.26	in Leigh of New Zealand.
840.26	What the scientists there told me was that
842.26	when protected this first marine reserve in 1975,
845.26	they hoped and expected that certain things might happen.
848.26	For example, they hoped that certain species of fish
850.26	like the New Zealand snapper would return
852.26	because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction.
855.26	And they did come back. What they couldn't predict was that other things would happen.
858.26	For example, these fish
860.26	predate on sea urchins,
862.26	and when the fish were all gone,
864.26	all anyone ever saw underwater
866.26	was just acres and acres of sea urchins.
869.26	But when the fish came back
871.26	and began predating and controlling the urchin population,
873.26	low and behold, kelp forests emerged in shallow water.
876.26	And that's because the urchins eat kelp.
879.26	So when the fish control the urchin population,
882.26	the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium.
884.26	You know, this is probably how the ocean looked here
886.26	one or 200 years ago, but nobody was around to tell us.
889.26	I worked in other parts of New Zealand as well,
891.26	in beautiful, fragile, protected areas
894.26	like in Fiordland, where this sea pen colony was found.
897.26	Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color.
900.26	In the northern part of New Zealand,
902.26	I dove in the blue water, where the water's a little warmer,
905.26	and photographed animals like this giant sting ray
907.26	swimming through an underwater canyon.
909.26	Every part of the ecosystem in this place
911.26	seems very healthy,
913.26	from tiny, little animals like a nudibrank
915.26	crawling over encrusting sponge
917.26	or a leatherjacket
919.26	that is a very important animal in this ecosystem
921.26	because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold.
925.26	And I wanted to finish with this photograph,
927.26	a picture I made on a very stormy day in New Zealand
930.26	when I just laid on the bottom
932.26	amidst a school of fish swirling around me.
934.26	And I was in a place that had only been protected
936.26	about 20 years ago.
938.26	And I talked to divers that had been diving there for many years,
941.26	and they said that the marine life was better here today
943.26	than it was in the 1960s.
945.26	And that's because it's been protected,
947.26	that it has come back.
949.26	So I think the message is clear.
951.26	The ocean is, indeed, resilient and tolerant to a point,
954.26	but we must be good custodians.
956.26	I became an underwater photographer
958.26	because I fell in love with the sea,
960.26	and I make pictures of it today because I want to protect it,
963.26	and I don't think it's too late.
965.26	Thank you very much.
