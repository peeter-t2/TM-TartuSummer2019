18.33	"""Jó napot, pacák"" Which,"
18.33	as somebody here must surely know,
24.33	"means ""What's up, guys?"" in Magyar,"
27.33	that peculiar non-Indo-European
27.33	language spoken by Hungarians
30.33	for which, given the fact
30.33	that cognitive diversity is
33.33	at least as threatened
33.33	as biodiversity on this planet,
36.33	few would have imagined much
36.33	of a future even a century or two ago.
40.33	"But there it is: ""Jó napot, pacák"""
42.33	I said somebody here must
42.33	surely know, because
46.33	despite the fact that there aren't
46.33	that many Hungarians to begin with,
49.664	and the further fact that, so far
49.664	as I know, there's not a drop
52.664	of Hungarian blood in my veins,
52.664	at every critical juncture of my life
56.33	there has been a Hungarian friend
56.33	or mentor there beside me.
60.33	I even have dreams that take
60.33	place in landscapes
62.64	I recognize as the landscapes
62.64	of Hungarian films,
66.33	especially the early
66.33	movies of Miklos Jancso.
69.33	So, how do I explain this
69.33	mysterious affinity?
73.33	Maybe it's because my native
73.33	state of South Carolina,
78.33	which is not much smaller
78.33	than present-day Hungary,
81.33	once imagined a future for itself
81.33	as an independent country.
84.33	And as a consequence of that presumption,
86.33	my hometown was burned
86.33	to the ground by an invading army,
90.33	an experience that has befallen
90.33	many a Hungarian town and village
94.33	throughout its long and troubled history.
97.33	Or maybe it's because when
97.33	I was a teenager back in the '50s,
100.33	my uncle Henry -- having
100.33	denounced the Ku Klux Klan
103.33	and been bombed for his trouble
103.33	and had crosses burned in his yard,
107.33	living under death threat -- took his wife
107.33	and children to Massachusetts for safety
111.33	and went back to South Carolina
111.33	to face down the Klan alone.
114.33	That was a very Hungarian thing to do,
117.33	as anyone will attest who remembers 1956.
121.33	And of course, from time
121.33	to time Hungarians
124.33	have invented
124.33	their own equivalent of the Klan.
126.593	Well, it seems to me that this
126.593	Hungarian presence in my life
133.33	is difficult to account for, but ultimately
133.33	I ascribe it to an admiration
139.33	for people with a complex moral awareness,
142.33	with a heritage of guilt and defeat
142.33	matched by defiance and bravado.
147.33	It's not a typical mindset
147.33	for most Americans,
150.33	but it is perforce typical
150.33	of virtually all Hungarians.
154.33	"So, ""Jó napot, pacák!"""
156.33	I went back to South Carolina
156.33	after some 15 years amid the alien corn
161.33	at the tail end of the 1960s,
164.33	with the reckless
164.33	condescension of that era
167.33	thinking I would save my people.
169.33	Never mind the fact that they were slow
169.33	to acknowledge they needed saving.
173.33	I labored in that vineyard
173.33	for a quarter century before
176.33	making my way to a little kingdom
176.33	of the just in upstate South Carolina,
180.33	a Methodist-affiliated institution
180.33	of higher learning called Wofford College.
184.33	I knew nothing about Wofford
186.33	and even less about Methodism,
188.33	but I was reassured on the first day
188.33	that I taught at Wofford College
192.33	to find, among the auditors
192.33	in my classroom,
194.45	a 90-year-old Hungarian, surrounded
194.45	by a bevy of middle-aged European women
201.33	who seemed to function
201.33	as an entourage of Rhinemaidens.
203.974	His name was Sandor Teszler.
206.33	He was a puckish widower
206.33	whose wife and children were dead
210.33	and whose grandchildren lived far away.
213.33	In appearance, he resembled
213.33	Mahatma Gandhi,
216.33	minus the loincloth,
216.33	plus orthopedic boots.
219.33	He had been born in 1903 in the provinces
223.33	of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire,
225.33	in what later would become Yugoslavia.
228.33	He was ostracized as a child,
228.33	not because he was a Jew --
231.33	his parents weren't very
231.33	religious anyhow --
232.33	but because he had been born
232.33	with two club feet,
235.33	a condition which, in those days,
235.33	required institutionalization
240.33	and a succession of painful operations
240.33	between the ages of one and 11.
244.33	He went to the commercial business
244.33	high school as a young man
247.33	in Budapest, and there
247.33	he was as smart as he was modest
252.33	and he enjoyed a considerable success.
252.33	And after graduation
255.33	when he went into textile
255.33	engineering, the success continued.
258.33	He built one plant after another.
260.33	He married and had two sons. He
260.33	had friends in high places who
263.33	assured him that he was of great
263.33	value to the economy.
266.33	Once, as he had left
266.33	instructions to have done,
271.33	he was summoned in the middle of the night
271.33	by the night watchman at one of his plants.
274.33	The night watchman had caught
274.33	an employee who was stealing socks --
279.33	it was a hosiery mill, and he simply
279.33	backed a truck up to the loading dock
282.33	and was shoveling in mountains of socks.
283.33	Mr. Teszler went down to the plant
283.33	and confronted the thief and said,
287.33	"""But why do you steal from me? If you"
287.33	"need money you have only to ask."""
292.33	The night watchman, seeing how things
292.33	were going and waxing indignant,
296.33	"said, ""Well, we're going to call"
296.33	"the police, aren't we?"""
298.33	"But Mr. Teszler answered, ""No,"
298.33	that will not be necessary.
301.33	"He will not steal from us again."""
303.33	Well, maybe he was too trusting,
303.33	because he stayed where he was
308.33	long after the Nazi Anschluss in Austria
310.33	and even after the arrests
310.33	and deportations began in Budapest.
315.33	He took the simple precaution of having
315.33	cyanide capsules placed in lockets
319.33	that could be worn about the necks
319.33	of himself and his family.
322.33	And then one day, it happened:
322.33	he and his family were arrested
326.33	and they were taken to a death
326.33	house on the Danube.
329.33	In those early days of the Final
329.33	Solution, it was handcrafted brutality;
333.33	people were beaten to death
333.33	and their bodies tossed into the river.
337.33	But none who entered that death
337.33	house had ever come out alive.
341.33	And in a twist you would not believe
341.33	in a Steven Spielberg film --
345.33	the Gauleiter who was overseeing this
345.33	brutal beating was the very same thief
350.33	who had stolen socks
350.33	from Mr. Teszler's hosiery mill.
354.33	It was a brutal beating. And
354.33	midway through that brutality,
359.33	one of Mr. Teszler's sons,
359.33	Andrew, looked up and said,
362.33	"""Is it time to take"
362.33	"the capsule now, Papa?"""
365.33	And the Gauleiter, who afterwards
365.33	vanishes from this story,
369.33	leaned down and whispered
369.33	into Mr. Teszler's ear,
372.33	"""No, do not take the capsule."
372.33	"Help is on the way."""
375.33	And then resumed the beating.
377.33	But help was on the way,
377.33	and shortly afterwards
379.593	a car arrived from the Swiss Embassy.
382.33	They were spirited to safety. They
382.33	were reclassified as Yugoslav citizens
386.33	and they managed to stay
386.33	one step ahead of their pursuers
389.33	for the duration of the War,
389.33	surviving burnings and bombings
393.33	and, at the end of the War,
393.33	arrest by the Soviets.
395.735	Probably, Mr. Teszler had gotten
395.735	some money into Swiss bank accounts
399.33	because he managed to take
399.33	his family first to Great Britain,
403.33	then to Long Island and then to the center
403.33	of the textile industry in the American South.
407.593	Which, as chance would have it,
407.593	was Spartanburg, South Carolina,
411.33	the location of Wofford College.
413.33	And there, Mr. Teszler began all over again
413.33	and once again achieved immense success,
419.33	especially after he invented the process
421.33	for manufacturing a new
421.33	fabric called double-knit.
424.33	And then in the late 1950s, in the aftermath
424.33	of Brown v. Board of Education,
431.33	when the Klan was resurgent
431.33	all over the South,
434.33	"Mr. Teszler said, ""I have"
434.33	"heard this talk before."""
438.33	And he called his top
438.33	assistant to him and asked,
443.33	"""Where would you say, in this"
443.33	"region, racism is most virulent?"""
446.33	"""Well, I don't rightly know, Mr. Teszler."
446.33	"I reckon that would be Kings Mountain."""
451.33	"""Good. Buy us some land in Kings Mountain"
455.33	and announce we are going
455.33	"to build a major plant there."""
457.33	The man did as he was told,
457.33	and shortly afterwards,
460.33	Mr. Teszler received a visit
460.33	from the white mayor of Kings Mountain.
464.33	Now, you should know that at that time,
467.33	the textile industry in the South
467.33	was notoriously segregated.
470.33	The white mayor visited
470.33	Mr. Teszler and said,
474.33	"""Mr. Teszler, I trust you’re going"
474.33	"to be hiring a lot of white workers."""
477.783	"Mr. Teszler told him, ""You bring me"
477.783	the best workers that you can find,
481.33	and if they are good
481.33	"enough, I will hire them."""
483.593	He also received a visit from the leader
483.593	of the black community,
488.33	"a minister, who said, ""Mr. Teszler,"
488.33	I sure hope you're going to
490.33	hire some black workers
490.33	"for this new plant of yours."""
492.878	"He got the same answer: ""You bring"
492.878	the best workers that you can find,
496.33	and if they are good
496.33	"enough, I will hire them."""
499.33	As it happens, the black minister did
499.33	his job better than the white mayor,
502.807	but that's neither here or there.
503.807	Mr. Teszler hired 16 men:
503.807	eight white, eight black.
507.33	They were to be his seed
507.33	group, his future foremen.
510.33	He had installed the heavy
510.33	equipment for his new process
513.33	in an abandoned store
513.33	in the vicinity of Kings Mountain,
516.33	and for two months these 16 men
516.33	would live and work together,
519.33	mastering the new process.
520.33	He gathered them together
520.33	after an initial tour of that facility
524.33	and he asked if there were any questions.
526.33	There was hemming and hawing
526.33	and shuffling of feet,
528.783	and then one of the white workers
528.783	stepped forward and said,
533.33	"""Well, yeah. We’ve looked at this place"
533.33	and there's only one place to sleep,
536.33	there's only one place to eat,
536.33	there's only one bathroom,
539.33	there's only one water fountain. Is this
539.33	"plant going to be integrated or what?"""
545.33	"Mr. Teszler said, ""You are being paid twice the wages"
545.33	of any other textile workers in this region
550.33	and this is how we do business.
550.33	"Do you have any other questions?"""
554.33	"""No, I reckon I don't."""
555.33	And two months later when
555.33	the main plant opened
559.33	and hundreds of new
559.33	workers, white and black,
561.473	poured in to see the facility
561.473	for the first time,
563.831	they were met by the 16 foremen, white
563.831	and black, standing shoulder to shoulder.
569.33	They toured the facility and were asked
569.33	if there were any questions, and
573.33	inevitably the same question arose:
574.33	"""Is this plant integrated or what?"""
576.33	And one of the white foremen
576.33	stepped forward and said,
579.33	"""You are being paid twice"
579.33	the wages of any other workers
583.33	in this industry in this region
583.33	and this is how we do business.
587.33	"Do you have any other questions?"""
589.33	And there were none. In one fell swoop,
593.33	Mr. Teszler had integrated the textile
593.33	industry in that part of the South.
597.33	It was an achievement
597.33	worthy of Mahatma Gandhi,
600.33	conducted with the shrewdness of a lawyer
600.33	and the idealism of a saint.
604.33	In his eighties, Mr. Teszler, having
604.33	retired from the textile industry,
610.33	adopted Wofford College,
612.33	auditing courses every semester,
614.33	and because he had a tendency
614.33	to kiss anything that moved,
618.33	"becoming affectionately known as ""Opi"""
618.33	-- which is Magyar for grandfather --
622.33	by all and sundry. Before I got
622.33	there, the library of the college
626.33	had been named for Mr. Teszler,
626.33	and after I arrived in 1993,
631.33	the faculty decided to honor itself by naming
631.33	Mr. Teszler Professor of the College --
636.33	partly because at that point
636.33	he had already taken
639.33	all of the courses in the catalog,
639.33	but mainly because
642.33	he was so conspicuously
642.33	wiser than any one of us.
647.33	To me, it was immensely reassuring
647.33	that the presiding spirit
651.33	of this little Methodist college
651.33	in upstate South Carolina
655.33	was a Holocaust survivor
655.33	from Central Europe.
659.33	Wise he was, indeed, but he also
659.33	had a wonderful sense of humor.
663.33	And once for an interdisciplinary class,
666.33	I was screening the opening segment
666.33	"of Ingmar Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal."""
670.33	As the medieval knight Antonius Block
670.33	returns from the wild goose chase
674.33	of the Crusades and arrives
674.33	on the rocky shore of Sweden,
677.33	only to find the specter
677.33	of death waiting for him,
680.33	Mr. Teszler sat in the dark
680.33	with his fellow students. And
684.33	as death opened his cloak
684.33	to embrace the knight
688.33	in a ghastly embrace, I heard
688.33	Mr. Teszler's tremulous voice:
692.33	"""Uh oh,"" he said, ""This doesn't"
692.33	"look so good."" (Laughter)"
696.33	But it was music that was his greatest
696.33	passion, especially opera.
703.33	And on the first occasion
703.33	that I visited his house, he gave me
706.33	honor of deciding what piece
706.33	of music we would listen to.
710.33	And I delighted him by rejecting
710.33	"""Cavalleria Rusticana"""
714.33	in favor of Bela
714.33	"Bartok's ""Bluebeard's Castle."""
717.33	I love Bartok's music, as did Mr. Teszler,
720.33	and he had virtually every recording
720.33	of Bartok's music ever issued.
724.33	And it was at his house
724.33	that I heard for the first time
726.974	Bartok's Third Piano
726.974	Concerto and learned from
729.33	Mr. Teszler that it had been composed
729.33	in nearby Asheville, North Carolina
734.33	in the last year of the composer's life.
736.33	He was dying of leukemia and he knew it,
739.33	and he dedicated this
739.33	concerto to his wife,
742.33	Dita, who was herself a concert pianist.
745.33	And into the slow, second movement,
745.33	"marked ""adagio religioso,"""
749.33	he incorporated the sounds
749.33	of birdsong that he heard
753.33	outside his window in what he knew
753.33	would be his last spring;
756.33	he was imagining a future for her
756.33	in which he would play no part.
762.33	And clearly this composition
762.33	is his final statement to her --
768.33	it was first performed after his death --
770.33	and through her to the world.
772.33	And just as clearly, it is saying,
772.33	"""It's okay. It was all so beautiful."
779.33	"Whenever you hear this, I will be there."""
783.33	It was only after Mr. Teszler's death
783.33	that I learned
788.33	that the marker on the grave of Bela
788.33	Bartok in Hartsdale, New York
792.33	was paid for by Sandor Teszler.
792.33	"""Jó napot, Bela!"""
797.33	Not long before Mr. Teszler’s
797.33	own death at the age of 97,
802.33	he heard me hold forth on human iniquity.
806.33	I delivered a lecture
806.33	in which I described history
808.735	as, on the whole, a tidal wave
808.735	of human suffering and brutality,
812.33	and Mr. Teszler came up to me afterwards
812.33	with gentle reproach and said,
817.33	"""You know, Doctor, human beings"
817.33	"are fundamentally good."""
823.33	And I made a vow
823.33	to myself, then and there,
827.33	that if this man who had such
827.33	cause to think otherwise
831.33	had reached that conclusion,
833.33	I would not presume to differ
833.33	until he released me from my vow.
837.33	And now he's dead, so
837.33	I'm stuck with my vow.
841.33	"""Jó napot, Sandor!"""
843.33	I thought my skein of Hungarian
843.33	mentors had come to an end,
847.33	but almost immediately I met Francis
847.33	Robicsek, a Hungarian doctor --
854.33	actually a heart surgeon in Charlotte, North
854.33	Carolina, then in his late seventies --
858.33	who had been a pioneer
858.33	in open-heart surgery,
860.497	and, tinkering away
860.497	in his garage behind his house,
864.33	had invented many of the devices
864.33	that are standard parts of those procedures.
869.33	He's also a prodigious art collector,
869.33	beginning as an intern in Budapest
874.33	by collecting 16th- and 17th-century
874.33	Dutch art and Hungarian painting,
878.33	and when he came to this country
878.33	moving on to Spanish colonial art,
883.33	Russian icons and finally Mayan ceramics.
886.33	He's the author of seven books,
886.33	six of them on Mayan ceramics.
889.33	It was he who broke the Mayan
889.33	codex, enabling scholars to relate
893.33	the pictographs on Mayan ceramics
893.33	to the hieroglyphs of the Mayan script.
897.33	On the occasion of my first
897.33	visit, we toured his house
900.33	and we saw hundreds
900.33	of works of museum quality,
903.33	and then we paused in front of a closed
903.33	door and Dr. Robicsek said,
908.33	"with obvious pride, ""Now"
908.33	"for the piece De resistance."""
911.33	And he opened the door
911.33	and we walked into a
914.33	windowless 20-by-20-foot room
914.33	with shelves from floor to ceiling, and
920.33	crammed on every shelf
920.33	his collection of Mayan ceramics.
922.33	Now, I know absolutely nothing
922.33	about Mayan ceramics,
924.807	but I wanted to be as ingratiating
924.807	as possible so I said,
927.807	"""But Dr. Robicsek, this"
927.807	"is absolutely dazzling."""
931.33	"""Yes,"" he said. ""That"
931.33	is what the Louvre said.
934.33	They would not leave me alone
934.33	until I let them have a piece,
938.33	"but it was not a good one."" (Laughter)"
940.33	Well, it occurred to me
940.33	that I should invite Dr. Robicsek
944.33	to lecture at Wofford
944.33	College on -- what else?
947.33	-- Leonardo da Vinci. And further,
947.33	I should invite him to meet
951.33	my oldest trustee, who had majored
951.33	in French history at Yale
955.33	some 70-odd years before and,
955.33	at 89, still ruled the world's
960.33	largest privately owned textile
960.33	empire with an iron hand.
965.33	His name is Roger Milliken.
965.33	And Mr. Milliken agreed,
969.33	and Dr. Robicsek agreed.
969.33	And Dr. Robicsek visited
972.33	and delivered the lecture
972.33	and it was a dazzling success.
975.33	And afterwards we convened
975.33	at the President's House with Dr. Robicsek
979.33	on one hand, Mr. Milliken on the other.
980.33	And it was only at that moment,
980.33	as we were sitting down to dinner,
984.33	that I recognized the enormity
984.33	of the risk I had created,
987.069	because to bring these two titans,
987.069	these two masters of the universe
990.33	together -- it was like introducing Mothra
990.33	to Godzilla over the skyline of Tokyo.
995.33	If they didn't like each other,
995.33	we could all get trampled to death.
998.473	But they did, they did like each other.
1000.473	They got along famously
1000.473	until the very end of the meal,
1003.33	and then they got into a furious argument.
1005.33	And what they were arguing about was this:
1007.33	whether the second Harry Potter movie
1007.33	was as good as the first. (Laughter)
1012.33	Mr. Milliken said it was not.
1012.33	Dr. Robicsek disagreed.
1017.33	I was still trying to take
1017.33	in the notion that these titans,
1021.33	these masters of the universe, in their spare
1021.33	time watch Harry Potter movies,
1025.021	when Mr. Milliken thought
1025.021	he would win the argument by saying,
1028.33	"""You just think it's so good"
1028.33	"because you didn't read the book."""
1031.33	And Dr. Robicsek reeled back in his chair,
1031.33	but quickly gathered his wits,
1035.33	"leaned forward and said, ""Well,"
1035.33	that is true, but I'll bet you went
1038.545	"to the movie with a grandchild."" ""Well,"
1038.545	"yes, I did,"" conceded Mr. Milliken."
1043.33	"""Aha!"" said Dr. Robicsek. ""I went to the movie"
1043.33	"all by myself."" (Laughter) (Applause)"
1048.33	And I realized, in this
1048.33	moment of revelation,
1053.33	that what these two men were
1053.33	revealing was the secret
1057.33	of their extraordinary success,
1057.33	each in his own right.
1060.33	And it lay precisely
1060.33	in that insatiable curiosity,
1064.33	that irrepressible desire to know,
1064.33	no matter what the subject,
1068.33	no matter what the cost,
1070.33	even at a time when the keepers
1070.33	of the Doomsday Clock
1073.33	are willing to bet even money
1073.33	that the human race won't be around
1076.45	to imagine anything in the year
1081.33	"""Live each day as if it"
1081.33	"is your last,"" said Mahatma Gandhi."
1085.33	"""Learn as if you'll live forever."""
1087.33	This is what I'm passionate about.
1087.33	It is precisely this.
1092.33	It is this inextinguishable, undaunted
1092.33	appetite for learning and experience,
1101.33	no matter how risible,
1101.33	no matter how esoteric,
1103.545	no matter how seditious it might seem.
1106.33	This defines the imagined futures
1106.33	of our fellow Hungarians --
1112.33	Robicsek, Teszler and Bartok
1112.33	-- as it does my own.
1117.33	As it does, I suspect,
1117.33	that of everybody here.
1121.33	"To which I need only add, ""Ez"
1121.33	"a mi munkank; es nem is keves."""
1127.33	This is our task; we know it will be hard.
1132.33	"""Ez a mi munkank; es nem is keves."
1132.33	"Jó napot, pacák!"" (Applause)"
