12.81	I'd like to tell you a story
12.81	about death and architecture.
16.841	A hundred years ago, we tended to die
16.841	of infectious diseases like pneumonia,
21.471	that, if they took hold,
21.471	would take us away quite quickly.
24.768	We tended to die at home,
24.768	in our own beds, looked after by family,
28.502	although that was the default option
30.294	because a lot of people
30.294	lacked access to medical care.
33.614	And then in the 20th century
33.614	a lot of things changed.
36.393	We developed new medicines like penicillin
38.49	so we could treat
38.49	those infectious diseases.
40.975	New medical technologies
40.975	like x-ray machines were invented.
44.249	And because they were
44.249	so big and expensive,
46.501	we needed large, centralized
46.501	buildings to keep them in,
49.519	and they became our modern hospitals.
51.818	After the Second World War,
53.241	a lot of countries set up 
53.241	universal healthcare systems
55.881	so that everyone who needed
55.881	treatment could get it.
58.528	The result was that lifespans extended
58.528	from about 45 at the start of the century
62.777	to almost double that today.
64.96	The 20th century was this time of huge 
64.96	optimism about what science could offer,
69.058	but with all of the focus on life,
69.058	death was forgotten,
72.785	even as our approach to death
72.785	changed dramatically.
75.58	Now, I'm an architect,
76.783	and for the past year and a half
76.783	I've been looking at these changes
80.025	and at what they mean for architecture
80.025	related to death and dying.
83.179	We now tend to die
83.179	of cancer and heart disease,
86.412	and what that means is that many of us
86.412	will have a long period of chronic illness
90.408	at the end of our lives.
92.382	During that period,
93.495	we'll likely spend a lot of time 
93.495	in hospitals and hospices and care homes.
98.558	Now, we've all been in a modern hospital.
100.764	You know those fluorescent lights
100.764	and the endless corridors
104.154	and those rows of uncomfortable chairs.
107.172	Hospital architecture
107.172	has earned its bad reputation.
110.934	But the surprising thing is,
110.934	it wasn't always like this.
114.091	This is L'Ospedale degli Innocenti,
114.091	built in 1419 by Brunelleschi,
118.425	who was one of the most famous
118.425	and influential architects of his time.
122.172	And when I look at this building
122.172	and then think about hospitals today,
125.515	what amazes me is
125.515	this building's ambition.
128.603	It's just a really great building.
130.252	It has these courtyards in the middle
132.086	so that all of the rooms
132.086	have daylight and fresh air,
134.619	and the rooms are big
134.619	and they have high ceilings,
137.032	so they just feel
137.032	more comfortable to be in.
139.516	And it's also beautiful.
141.281	Somehow, we've forgotten
141.281	that that's even possible for a hospital.
145.112	Now, if we want better buildings
145.112	for dying, then we have to talk about it,
149.135	but because we find the subject
149.135	of death uncomfortable,
151.706	we don't talk about it,
153.146	and we don't question how we
153.146	as a society approach death.
156.458	One of the things that surprised me
156.458	most in my research, though,
159.632	is how changeable attitudes actually are.
162.317	This is the first crematorium in the U.K.,
164.709	which was built in Woking in the 1870s.
167.518	And when this was first built,
167.518	there were protests in the local village.
170.925	Cremation wasn't socially acceptable,
170.925	and 99.8 percent of people got buried.
175.808	And yet, only a hundred years later,
175.808	three quarters of us get cremated.
179.584	People are actually really open
179.584	to changing things
182.111	if they're given the chance
182.111	to talk about them.
184.512	So this conversation
184.512	about death and architecture
187.835	was what I wanted to start
187.835	when I did my first exhibition on it
190.994	in Venice in June,
190.994	"which was called ""Death in Venice."""
194.22	It was designed to be quite playful
197.494	so that people would
197.494	literally engage with it.
199.692	This is one of our exhibits,
199.692	which is an interactive map of London
202.947	that shows just how much
202.947	of the real estate in the city
205.622	is given over to death and dying,
207.501	and as you wave your hand across the map,
209.87	the name of that piece of real estate,
209.87	the building or cemetery, is revealed.
214.699	Another of our exhibits
214.699	was a series of postcards
217.207	that people could take away with them.
219.204	And they showed people's homes
219.204	and hospitals
221.665	and cemeteries and mortuaries,
224.08	and they tell the story
224.08	of the different spaces
226.541	that we pass through
226.541	on either side of death.
229.374	We wanted to show
229.374	that where we die
231.719	is a key part of how we die.
234.97	Now, the strangest thing was the way
234.97	that visitors reacted to the exhibition,
239.753	especially the audio-visual works.
242.121	We had people dancing
242.121	and running and jumping
245.813	as they tried to activate
245.813	the exhibits in different ways,
248.808	and at a certain point
248.808	they would kind of stop
251.252	and remember that they were in
251.252	an exhibition about death,
253.986	and that maybe that's not
253.986	how you're supposed to act.
256.61	But actually, I would question
256.61	whether there is one way
259.257	that you're supposed to act around death,
261.532	and if there's not, I'd ask you to think
261.532	about what you think a good death is,
266.083	and what you think that architecture
266.083	that supports a good death might be like,
269.752	and mightn't it be a little less like this
269.752	and a little more like this?
274.48	Thank you.
276.694	(Applause)
