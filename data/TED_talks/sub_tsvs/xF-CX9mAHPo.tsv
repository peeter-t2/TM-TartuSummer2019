12.581	I'd like to talk to you today
14.851	about a whole new way to think
14.851	about sexual activity
19.037	and sexuality education, by comparison.
23.11	If you talk to someone today in America
25.776	about sexual activity,
27.6	you'll find pretty soon
27.6	you're not just talking
31.248	about sexual activity.
32.906	You're also talking about baseball.
35.952	Because baseball is the dominant
35.952	cultural metaphor
40.186	that Americans use to think about
42.704	and talk about sexual activity,
45.553	and we know that because there's
47.101	all this language in English
49.685	that seems to be talking about baseball
52.63	but that's really talking
52.63	about sexual activity.
56.489	So, for example, you can
56.489	be a pitcher or a catcher,
59.688	and that corresponds to whether you
61.615	perform a sexual act
61.615	or receive a sexual act.
65.383	Of course, there are the bases,
66.389	which refer to specific sexual activities
69.607	that happen in a very specific order,
72.822	ultimately resulting in scoring a run
75.6	or hitting a home run,
76.604	which is usually having
76.604	vaginal intercourse
78.912	to the point of orgasm,
80.624	at least for the guy.
83.017	(Laughter)
84.946	You can strike out, which means
86.447	you don't get to have any sexual activity.
88.932	And if you're a benchwarmer,
90.29	you might be a virgin or somebody who for
92.705	whatever reason isn't in the game,
94.954	maybe because of your age
94.954	or because of your ability
98.119	or because of your skillset.
101.165	A bat's a penis,
102.783	and a nappy dugout
102.783	is a vulva, or a vagina.
106.852	A glove or a catcher's mitt is a condom.
109.96	A switch-hitter is a bisexual person,
112.877	and we gay and lesbian folks
112.877	play for the other team.
116.569	And then there's this one:
119.168	"""if there's grass"
119.168	"on the field, play ball."""
123.192	And that usually refers to
125.596	if a young person, specifically
125.596	often a young woman,
128.953	is old enough to have pubic hair,
130.685	she's old enough to have sex with.
133.41	This baseball model
133.41	is incredibly problematic.
136.393	It's sexist. It's heterosexist.
138.744	It's competitive. It's goal-directed.
141.12	And it can't result in healthy sexuality
143.903	developing in young people or in adults.
146.951	So we need a new model.
148.673	I'm here today to offer
148.673	you that new model.
151.232	And it's based on
153.007	pizza.
154.833	Now pizza is something
154.833	that is universally understood
158.28	and that most people associate
158.28	with a positive experience.
161.177	So let's do this.
162.157	Let's take baseball
162.157	and pizza and compare it
165.126	when talking about three aspects
165.126	of sexual activity:
168.57	the trigger for sexual activity,
170.223	what happens during sexual activity,
172.441	and the expected outcome
172.441	of sexual activity.
175.593	So when do you play baseball?
178.401	You play baseball when
178.401	it's baseball season
180.841	and when there's a game on the schedule.
183.123	It's not exactly your choice.
185.433	So if it's prom night or a wedding night
188.329	or at a party or if our parents
188.329	aren't home,
191.399	hey, it's just batter up.
194.131	Can you imagine saying to your coach,
195.917	"""Uh, I'm not really feeling it today,"
198.418	"I think I'll sit this game out."""
200.485	That's just not the way it happens.
202.577	And when you get together
202.577	to play baseball,
204.649	immediately you're
204.649	with two opposing teams,
207.1	one playing offense, one playing defense,
209.43	somebody's trying to move
209.43	deeper into the field.
212.225	That's usually a sign to the boy.
214.158	Somebody's trying to defend
214.158	people moving into the field.
217.194	That's often given to the girl.
219.423	It's competitive.
220.458	We're not playing with each other.
222.247	We're playing against each other.
223.654	And when you show up to play baseball,
225.586	nobody needs to talk
225.586	about what we're going to do
228.13	or how this baseball game
228.13	might be good for us.
230.671	Everybody knows the rules.
231.934	You just take your position
231.934	and play the game.
236.313	But when do you have pizza?
238.673	Well, you have pizza when
238.673	you're hungry for pizza.
242.915	It starts with an internal sense,
242.915	an internal desire, or a need.
247.009	"""Huh. I could go for some pizza."""
250.681	(Laughter)
252.938	And because it's an internal desire,
255.915	we actually have some sense
255.915	of control over that.
258.273	I could decide that I'm hungry
259.827	but know that it's not
259.827	a great time to eat.
263.358	And then when we get together
263.358	with someone for pizza,
266.02	we're not competing with them,
268.87	we're looking for an experience
270.37	that both of us will share
271.656	that's satisfying for both of us,
273.63	and when you get together
273.63	for pizza with somebody,
276.635	what's the first thing you do?
278.183	You talk about it.
280.105	You talk about what you want.
281.636	You talk about what you like.
283.129	You may even negotiate it.
284.685	"""How do you feel"
284.685	"about pepperoni?"" (Laughter)"
287.454	"""Not so much, I'm kind"
287.454	"of a mushroom guy myself."""
290.081	"""Well, maybe we can go half and half."""
292.147	And even if you've had pizza with somebody
294.171	for a very long time,
297.206	don't you still say things like,
299.268	"""Should we get the usual?"""
301.261	(Laughter)
302.424	"""Or maybe something"
302.424	"a little more adventurous?"""
306.181	Okay, so when you're playing baseball,
308.015	so if we talk
308.015	about during sexual activity,
310.133	when you're playing baseball,
311.538	you're just supposed to round the bases
314.066	in the proper order one at a time.
316.546	You can't hit the ball
316.546	and run to right field.
318.761	That doesn't work.
319.983	And you also can't get
319.983	to second base and say,
322.301	"""I like it here. I'm going to stay here."""
326.701	No.
328.122	And also, of course,
328.122	with baseball, there's, like,
330.527	the specific equipment
330.527	and a specific skill set.
333.027	Not everybody can play baseball.
333.027	It's pretty exclusive.
336.654	Okay, but what about pizza?
338.312	When we're trying to figure
338.312	out what's good for pizza,
340.908	isn't it all about what's our pleasure?
343.593	There are a million different
343.593	kinds of pizza.
345.325	There's a million different toppings.
347.111	There's a million different
347.111	ways to eat pizza.
349.413	And none of them are wrong.
349.413	They're different.
352.362	And in this case, difference is good,
354.81	because that's going
354.81	to increase the chance
356.882	that we're having a satisfying experience.
359.466	And lastly, what's the expected
359.466	outcome of baseball?
362.426	Well, in baseball, you play to win.
366.124	You score as many runs as you can.
368.657	There's always a winner in baseball,
370.645	and that means there's always
370.645	a loser in baseball.
374.066	But what about pizza?
375.722	Well, in pizza, we're not really --
377.933	there's no winning. How do you win pizza?
381.6	You don't. But you do look for,
384.855	"""Are we satisfied?"""
386.576	And sometimes that can
386.576	be different amounts
388.648	over different times
388.648	or with different people
390.815	or on different days.
392.732	And we get to decide
392.732	when we feel satisfied.
395.862	If we're still hungry,
395.862	we might have some more.
398.7	If you eat too much, though,
400.238	you just feel gross.
402.143	(Laughter)
404.552	So what if we could take this pizza model
407.238	and overlay it on top
407.238	of sexuality education?
410.61	A lot of sexuality education
410.61	that happens today
413.149	is so influenced by the baseball model,
416.575	and it sets up education that can't help
420.368	but produce unhealthy
420.368	sexuality in young people.
424.101	And those young people
424.101	become older people.
426.364	But if we could create sexuality education
429.823	that was more like pizza,
432.172	we could create education
432.172	that invites people
435.62	to think about their own desires,
437.915	to make deliberate decisions
437.915	about what they want,
441.167	to talk about it with their partners,
443.799	and to ultimately look for
445.472	not some external outcome
448.616	but for what feels satisfying,
451.773	and we get to decide that.
454.292	You may have noticed
455.053	in the baseball and pizza comparison,
457.932	under the baseball, it's all commands.
460.772	They're all exclamation points.
462.869	But under the pizza
462.869	model, they're questions.
465.938	And who gets to answer those questions?
467.82	You do. I do.
471.48	So remember, when we're thinking about
473.38	sexuality education and sexual activity,
476.126	baseball, you're out.
478.316	Pizza is the way to think about healthy,
481.548	satisfying sexual activity,
483.988	and good, comprehensive
483.988	sexuality education.
486.928	Thank you very much for your time.
489.158	(Applause)
