16.495	Everything I do, and everything I do professionally --
19.974	my life -- has been shaped
23.959	by seven years of work as a young man in Africa.
29.783	From 1971 to 1977 --
33.304	I look young, but I'm not — (Laughter) --
37.184	I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Somalia,
42.117	in projects of technical cooperation with African countries.
46.334	I worked for an Italian NGO,
49.452	and every single project that we set up in Africa
55.602	failed.
59.046	And I was distraught.
63.19	I thought, age 21, that we Italians were good people
67.438	and we were doing good work in Africa.
70.82	Instead, everything we touched we killed.
77.833	Our first project, the one that has inspired my first book,
82.936	"""Ripples from the Zambezi,"""
85.824	was a project where we Italians
88.389	decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food.
94.31	So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia
98.659	in this absolutely magnificent valley
102.139	going down to the Zambezi River,
105.392	and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes
109.02	and zucchini and ...
111.811	And of course the local people had absolutely no interest
114.006	in doing that, so we paid them to come and work,
116.921	and sometimes they would show up. (Laughter)
121.056	And we were amazed that the local people,
123.783	in such a fertile valley, would not have any agriculture.
126.87	But instead of asking them how come they were not
130.078	"growing anything, we simply said, ""Thank God we're here."" (Laughter)"
134.1	"""Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation."""
138.768	And of course, everything in Africa grew beautifully.
142.228	We had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy, a tomato
144.886	would grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size.
148.495	And we could not believe, and we were telling the Zambians,
151.316	"""Look how easy agriculture is."""
153.788	When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red,
156.799	overnight, some 200 hippos came out from the river
160.227	and they ate everything. (Laughter)
164.23	"And we said to the Zambians, ""My God, the hippos!"""
168.814	"And the Zambians said, ""Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here."" (Laughter)"
174.495	"""Why didn't you tell us?""""You never asked."""
180.747	I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa,
185.835	but then I saw what the Americans were doing,
188.579	what the English were doing, what the French were doing,
191.315	and after seeing what they were doing,
193.908	I became quite proud of our project in Zambia.
197.267	Because, you see, at least we fed the hippos.
202.256	You should see the rubbish — (Applause) --
206.503	You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed
208.997	on unsuspecting African people.
210.797	You want to read the book,
212.373	"read ""Dead Aid,"" by Dambisa Moyo,"
217.304	Zambian woman economist.
220.311	The book was published in 2009.
222.681	We Western donor countries have given the African continent
227.255	two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years.
232.248	I'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done.
236.073	Just go and read her book.
238.261	Read it from an African woman, the damage that we have done.
246.624	We Western people are imperialist, colonialist missionaries,
252.591	and there are only two ways we deal with people:
255.905	We either patronize them, or we are paternalistic.
260.294	"The two words come from the Latin root ""pater,"""
263.398	"which means ""father."""
265.628	But they mean two different things.
269.481	Paternalistic, I treat anybody from a different culture
272.842	"as if they were my children. ""I love you so much."""
278.645	Patronizing, I treat everybody from another culture
283.152	as if they were my servants.
285.55	"That's why the white people in Africa are called ""bwana,"" boss."
291.621	I was given a slap in the face reading a book,
295.204	"""Small is Beautiful,"" written by Schumacher, who said,"
300.171	above all in economic development, if people
303.129	do not wish to be helped, leave them alone.
307.684	This should be the first principle of aid.
310.511	The first principle of aid is respect.
314.197	This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference
316.725	lay a stick on the floor, and said,
320.526	"""Can we -- can you imagine a city"
324.784	"that is not neocolonial?"""
328.706	I decided when I was 27 years old
332.859	to only respond to people,
337.066	and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation,
341.49	where you never initiate anything,
344.865	you never motivate anybody, but you become a servant
349.087	of the local passion, the servant of local people
352.648	who have a dream to become a better person.
357.046	So what you do -- you shut up.
361.455	You never arrive in a community with any ideas,
365.167	and you sit with the local people.
369.606	We don't work from offices.
371.798	We meet at the cafe. We meet at the pub.
375.764	We have zero infrastructure.
379.079	And what we do, we become friends,
382.406	and we find out what that person wants to do.
387.166	The most important thing is passion.
389.024	You can give somebody an idea.
391.264	If that person doesn't want to do it,
392.886	what are you going to do?
396.567	The passion that the person has for her own growth
401.113	is the most important thing.
402.839	The passion that that man has for his own personal growth
407.396	is the most important thing.
409.061	And then we help them to go and find the knowledge,
412.148	because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
417.617	The person with the idea may not have the knowledge,
420.336	but the knowledge is available.
422.474	So years and years ago, I had this idea:
426.333	Why don't we, for once, instead of arriving in the community
430.499	to tell people what to do, why don't, for once,
435.202	listen to them? But not in community meetings.
440.027	Let me tell you a secret.
444.941	There is a problem with community meetings.
449.286	Entrepreneurs never come,
452.992	and they never tell you, in a public meeting,
456.164	what they want to do with their own money,
459.78	what opportunity they have identified.
463.609	So planning has this blind spot.
468.533	The smartest people in your community you don't even know,
472.824	because they don't come to your public meetings.
480.664	What we do, we work one-on-one,
484.624	and to work one-on-one, you have to create
486.337	a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
489.012	You have to create a new profession.
491.584	The profession is the family doctor of enterprise,
497.088	the family doctor of business, who sits with you
500.659	in your house, at your kitchen table, at the cafe,
503.784	and helps you find the resources to transform your passion
507.822	into a way to make a living.
510.215	I started this as a tryout in Esperance, in Western Australia.
515.536	I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time,
517.788	trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit
522.111	that we arrive and tell you what to do.
525.923	And so what I did in Esperance that first year
530.503	was to just walk the streets, and in three days
535.129	I had my first client, and I helped this first guy
538.023	who was smoking fish from a garage, was a Maori guy,
542.568	and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth,
545.873	to get organized, and then the fishermen came to me to say,
549.003	"""You the guy who helped Maori? Can you help us?"""
551.989	And I helped these five fishermen to work together
555.153	and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany
559.289	for 60 cents a kilo, but we found a way
563.122	to take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo,
568.473	and the farmers came to talk to me, said,
569.995	"""Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?"""
572.284	In a year, I had 27 projects going on,
575.21	and the government came to see me to say,
577.362	"""How can you do that?"
579.749	"How can you do — ?"" And I said, ""I do something very, very, very difficult."
583.075	"I shut up, and listen to them."" (Laughter)"
588.728	So — (Applause) —
596.95	"So the government says, ""Do it again."" (Laughter)"
601.555	We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
604.713	We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
608.248	There is a new generation of entrepreneurs
609.92	who are dying of solitude.
612.449	Peter Drucker, one of the greatest management consultants in history,
618.608	died age 96, a few years ago.
623.16	Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy
624.94	before becoming involved in business,
626.904	and this is what Peter Drucker says:
629.781	"""Planning is actually incompatible"
635.445	"with an entrepreneurial society and economy."""
639.694	Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship.
645.937	So now you're rebuilding Christchurch
648.632	without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch
652.113	want to do with their own money and their own energy.
656.771	You have to learn how to get these people
659.969	to come and talk to you.
662.966	You have to offer them confidentiality, privacy,
667.794	you have to be fantastic at helping them,
671.578	and then they will come, and they will come in droves.
675.572	In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients.
678.467	Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people,
681.039	the intelligence and the passion?
683.281	Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning?
686.812	Local, passionate people. That's who you have applauded.
692.772	So what I'm saying is that
698.043	entrepreneurship is where it's at.
700.51	We are at the end of the first industrial revolution --
703.656	nonrenewable fossil fuels, manufacturing --
706.969	and all of a sudden, we have systems which are not sustainable.
711.426	The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
714.073	Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable.
717.394	What we have to look at is at how we
720.482	feed, cure, educate, transport, communicate
726.5	for seven billion people in a sustainable way.
730.051	The technologies do not exist to do that.
733.945	Who is going to invent the technology
737.313	for the green revolution? Universities? Forget about it!
743.811	Government? Forget about it!
746.704	It will be entrepreneurs, and they're doing it now.
751.958	There's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine
754.853	many, many years ago.
756.526	There was a group of experts who were invited
758.746	to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860.
763.374	And in 1860, this group of people came together,
765.864	and they all speculated about what would happen
768.811	to the city of New York in 100 years,
770.665	and the conclusion was unanimous:
772.141	The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
776.082	Why? Because they looked at the curve and said,
778.343	if the population keeps growing at this rate,
781.309	to move the population of New York around,
785.445	they would have needed six million horses,
788.31	and the manure created by six million horses
791.665	would be impossible to deal with.
794.044	They were already drowning in manure. (Laughter)
799.674	So 1860, they are seeing this dirty technology
804.723	that is going to choke the life out of New York.
809.541	So what happens? In 40 years' time, in the year 1900,
814.67	in the United States of America, there were 1,001
819.273	car manufacturing companies -- 1,001.
825.653	The idea of finding a different technology
829.259	had absolutely taken over,
831.621	and there were tiny, tiny little factories in backwaters.
836.537	Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
842.169	However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
846.54	First, you have to offer them confidentiality.
849.934	Otherwise they don't come and talk to you.
852.272	Then you have to offer them absolute, dedicated,
856.582	passionate service to them.
860.034	And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship.
863.681	The smallest company, the biggest company,
866.452	has to be capable of doing three things beautifully:
869.842	The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic,
874.093	you have to have fantastic marketing,
877.917	and you have to have tremendous financial management.
881.286	Guess what?
883.874	We have never met a single human being
886.288	in the world who can make it, sell it and look after the money.
891.935	It doesn't exist.
894.766	This person has never been born.
897.516	We've done the research, and we have looked
900.008	at the 100 iconic companies of the world --
903.959	Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford,
908.54	all the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
911.143	There's only one thing that all the successful companies
913.819	in the world have in common, only one:
917.307	None were started by one person.
921.842	Now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds
926.344	in Northumberland, and we start the class
929.885	by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography,
934.309	and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline,
938.146	in the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography
941.774	"how many times Richard uses the word ""I"""
944.929	"and how many times he uses the word ""we."""
947.638	"Never the word ""I,"" and the word ""we"" 32 times."
952.378	He wasn't alone when he started.
955.631	Nobody started a company alone. No one.
960.675	So we can create the community
963.781	where we have facilitators who come from a small business background
967.207	sitting in cafes, in bars, and your dedicated buddies
974.704	who will do to you, what somebody did for this gentleman
978.376	who talks about this epic,
981.617	"somebody who will say to you, ""What do you need?"
983.872	What can you do? Can you make it?
985.811	"Okay, can you sell it? Can you look after the money?"""
988.061	"""Oh, no, I cannot do this.""""Would you like me to find you somebody?"""
991.815	We activate communities.
993.903	We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator
997.947	to help you to find resources and people
1001.07	and we have discovered that the miracle
1004.059	of the intelligence of local people is such
1006.563	that you can change the culture and the economy
1010.27	of this community just by capturing the passion,
1014.451	the energy and imagination of your own people.
1018.088	Thank you. (Applause)
