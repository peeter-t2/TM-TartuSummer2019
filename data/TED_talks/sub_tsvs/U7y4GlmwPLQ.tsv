12.88	I want you to reimagine
12.88	how life is organized on earth.
18.92	Think of the planet
18.92	like a human body that we inhabit.
24.16	The skeleton is the transportation system
24.16	of roads and railways,
28.84	bridges and tunnels, air and seaports
31.6	that enable our mobility
31.6	across the continents.
34.84	The vascular system that powers the body
38.12	are the oil and gas pipelines
38.12	and electricity grids.
40.92	that distribute energy.
42.68	And the nervous system of communications
45.72	is the Internet cables,
45.72	satellites, cellular networks
49.44	and data centers that allow
49.44	us to share information.
53.48	This ever-expanding infrastructural matrix
57.88	already consists of 64 million
57.88	kilometers of roads,
62.92	four million kilometers of railways,
65.76	two million kilometers of pipelines
68.72	and one million kilometers
68.72	of Internet cables.
73.16	What about international borders?
76.959	We have less than
81.68	Let's build a better map of the world.
84.72	And we can start by overcoming
84.72	some ancient mythology.
89.08	There's a saying with which
89.08	all students of history are familiar:
93.16	"""Geography is destiny."""
95.96	Sounds so grave, doesn't it?
98.12	It's such a fatalistic adage.
100.44	It tells us that landlocked countries
100.44	are condemned to be poor,
104.68	that small countries
104.68	cannot escape their larger neighbors,
107.92	that vast distances are insurmountable.
111.88	But every journey I take around the world,
115.48	I see an even greater force
115.48	sweeping the planet:
119.96	connectivity.
122.08	The global connectivity revolution,
122.08	in all of its forms --
125.84	transportation, energy
125.84	and communications --
128.56	has enabled such a quantum leap
128.56	in the mobility of people,
132.84	of goods, of resources, of knowledge,
135.6	such that we can no longer even think
135.6	of geography as distinct from it.
140.84	In fact, I view the two forces
140.84	as fusing together
144.96	"into what I call ""connectography."""
148.28	Connectography represents a quantum leap
152.24	in the mobility of people,
152.24	resources and ideas,
155.68	but it is an evolution,
158.28	an evolution of the world
158.28	from political geography,
164.48	which is how we legally divide the world,
168	to functional geography,
170.24	which is how we actually use the world,
172.84	from nations and borders,
172.84	to infrastructure and supply chains.
177.72	Our global system is evolving
181.24	from the vertically integrated
181.24	empires of the 19th century,
184.92	through the horizontally interdependent
184.92	nations of the 20th century,
189.2	into a global network civilization
189.2	in the 21st century.
195.24	Connectivity, not sovereignty,
198.6	has become the organizing principle
198.6	of the human species.
202.84	(Applause)
207.48	We are becoming
207.48	this global network civilization
210.72	because we are literally building it.
213.52	All of the world's defense budgets
213.52	and military spending taken together
217.24	total just under
217.24	two trillion dollars per year.
220.36	Meanwhile, our global
220.36	infrastructure spending
222.76	is projected to rise
222.76	to nine trillion dollars per year
226.16	within the coming decade.
227.72	And, well, it should.
229.36	We have been living
229.36	off an infrastructure stock
232.12	meant for a world population
232.12	of three billion,
235.64	as our population has crossed
235.64	seven billion to eight billion
238.76	and eventually nine billion and more.
241.28	As a rule of thumb, we should spend
241.28	about one trillion dollars
246	on the basic infrastructure needs
246	of every billion people in the world.
251.36	Not surprisingly, Asia is in the lead.
255.32	In 2015, China announced the creation
257.96	of the Asian Infrastructure
257.96	Investment Bank,
261.88	which together with a network
261.88	of other organizations
265.08	aims to construct a network
265.08	of iron and silk roads,
268.519	stretching from Shanghai to Lisbon.
271.64	And as all of this topographical
271.64	engineering unfolds,
275.84	we will likely spend more
275.84	on infrastructure in the next 40 years,
281.32	we will build more infrastructure
281.32	in the next 40 years,
284.68	than we have in the past 4,000 years.
288.76	Now let's stop and think
288.76	about it for a minute.
291.56	Spending so much more on building
291.56	the foundations of global society
296.36	rather than on the tools to destroy it
299.2	can have profound consequences.
301.8	Connectivity is how
301.8	we optimize the distribution
304.88	of people and resources around the world.
307.48	It is how mankind comes to be more
307.48	than just the sum of its parts.
312.84	I believe that is what is happening.
317	Connectivity has a twin megatrend
317	in the 21st century:
320.96	planetary urbanization.
324	Cities are the infrastructures
324	that most define us.
327.84	By 2030, more than two thirds
327.84	of the world's population
331.08	will live in cities.
332.36	And these are not
332.36	mere little dots on the map,
335.12	but they are vast archipelagos
335.12	stretching hundreds of kilometers.
339.36	Here we are in Vancouver,
340.96	at the head of the Cascadia Corridor
342.84	that stretches south
342.84	across the US border to Seattle.
346.6	The technology powerhouse
346.6	of Silicon Valley
348.96	begins north of San Francisco
348.96	down to San Jose
351.84	and across the bay to Oakland.
353.64	The sprawl of Los Angeles
353.64	now passes San Diego
356.64	across the Mexican border to Tijuana.
358.92	San Diego and Tijuana
358.92	now share an airport terminal
361.92	where you can exit into either country.
364.16	Eventually, a high-speed rail network
364.16	may connect the entire Pacific spine.
369.68	America's northeastern megalopolis
369.68	begins in Boston through New York
373.84	and Philadelphia to Washington.
375.64	It contains more than 50 million people
377.84	and also has plans
377.84	for a high-speed rail network.
380.64	But Asia is where we really see
380.64	the megacities coming together.
385.28	This continuous strip of light
385.28	from Tokyo through Nagoya to Osaka
389.56	contains more than 80 million people
391.76	and most of Japan's economy.
394.2	It is the world's largest megacity.
397.16	For now.
398.8	But in China, megacity clusters
398.8	are coming together
401.36	with populations
401.36	reaching 100 million people.
404.28	The Bohai Rim around Beijing,
406.2	The Yangtze River Delta around Shanghai
408.48	and the Pearl River Delta,
410.4	stretching from Hong Kong
410.4	north to Guangzhou.
412.76	And in the middle,
414.12	the Chongqing-Chengdu megacity cluster,
417.04	whose geographic footprint
417.04	is almost the same size
419.84	as the country of Austria.
423.263	And any number of these megacity clusters
425.24	has a GDP approaching
425.24	two trillion dollars --
428.32	that's almost the same
428.32	as all of India today.
431.56	So imagine if our global diplomatic
431.56	institutions, such as the G20,
437.24	were to base their membership
437.24	on economic size
440.8	rather than national representation.
443.32	Some Chinese megacities
443.32	may be in and have a seat at the table,
446.92	while entire countries,
446.92	like Argentina or Indonesia would be out.
452.08	Moving to India, whose population
452.08	will soon exceed that of China,
455.8	it too has a number of megacity clusters,
458.12	such as the Delhi Capital Region
460.56	and Mumbai.
462.04	In the Middle East,
463.28	Greater Tehran is absorbing
463.28	one third of Iran's population.
466.44	Most of Egypt's 80 million people
468.32	live in the corridor
468.32	between Cairo and Alexandria.
471.36	And in the gulf, a necklace
471.36	of city-states is forming,
475.4	from Bahrain and Qatar,
476.88	through the United Arab Emirates
476.88	to Muscat in Oman.
480.52	And then there's Lagos,
482.8	Africa's largest city
482.8	and Nigeria's commercial hub.
486.68	It has plans for a rail network
488.76	that will make it the anchor
488.76	of a vast Atlantic coastal corridor,
493.2	stretching across Benin, Togo and Ghana,
496.28	to Abidjan, the capital
496.28	of the Ivory Coast.
499.76	But these countries are suburbs of Lagos.
504	In a megacity world,
505.88	countries can be suburbs of cities.
510.64	By 2030, we will have as many
510.64	as 50 such megacity clusters in the world.
517.4	So which map tells you more?
519.28	Our traditional map
519.28	of 200 discrete nations
522.44	that hang on most of our walls,
524.36	or this map of the 50 megacity clusters?
528.159	And yet, even this is incomplete
530.919	because you cannot understand
530.919	any individual megacity
534.96	without understanding
534.96	its connections to the others.
538.88	People move to cities to be connected,
541.28	and connectivity
541.28	is why these cities thrive.
545.32	Any number of them,
545.32	such as Sao Paulo or Istanbul or Moscow,
549	has a GDP approaching or exceeding
549	one third of one half
553.12	of their entire national GDP.
556.12	But equally importantly,
557.92	you cannot calculate
557.92	any of their individual value
560.8	without understanding
560.8	the role of the flows of people,
564.48	of finance, of technology
566.2	that enable them to thrive.
568.64	Take the Gauteng province of South Africa,
571.4	which contains Johannesburg
571.4	and the capital Pretoria.
574.56	It too represents just over
574.56	a third of South Africa's GDP.
578.52	But equally importantly,
578.52	it is home to the offices
581.8	of almost every single
581.8	multinational corporation
584.8	that invests directly into South Africa
587.04	and indeed, into the entire
587.04	African continent.
590.68	Cities want to be part
590.68	of global value chains.
594.4	They want to be part
594.4	of this global division of labor.
598	That is how cities think.
600.64	I've never met a mayor who said to me,
602.48	"""I want my city to be cut off."""
604.84	They know that their cities belong as much
607.92	to the global network civilization
607.92	as to their home countries.
614.68	Now, for many people,
614.68	urbanization causes great dismay.
618.92	They think cities are wrecking the planet.
621.96	But right now,
623.2	there are more than 200
623.2	intercity learning networks thriving.
627.48	That is as many as the number
627.48	of intergovernmental organizations
630.84	that we have.
632.08	And all of these intercity networks
632.08	are devoted to one purpose,
636.48	mankind's number one priority
636.48	in the 21st century:
641.2	sustainable urbanization.
644.68	Is it working?
646.56	Let's take climate change.
648.32	We know that summit after summit
648.32	in New York and Paris
651.08	is not going to reduce
651.08	greenhouse gas emissions.
654.56	But what we can see
654.56	is that transferring technology
657.88	and knowledge and policies between cities
660.52	is how we've actually begun to reduce
660.52	the carbon intensity of our economies.
665.16	Cities are learning from each other.
667.32	How to install zero-emissions buildings,
669.8	how to deploy electric
669.8	car-sharing systems.
672.96	In major Chinese cities,
674.2	they're imposing quotas
674.2	on the number of cars on the streets.
677.28	In many Western cities,
678.56	young people don't even
678.56	want to drive anymore.
681.72	Cities have been part of the problem,
683.96	now they are part of the solution.
686.88	Inequality is the other great challenge
686.88	to achieving sustainable urbanization.
691.96	When I travel through megacities
691.96	from end to end --
695.4	it takes hours and days --
697.52	I experience the tragedy
697.52	of extreme disparity
701.28	within the same geography.
704.08	And yet, our global stock
704.08	of financial assets
707.12	has never been larger,
708.6	approaching 300 trillion dollars.
712.12	That's almost four times
712.12	the actual GDP of the world.
716.52	We have taken on such enormous debts
716.52	since the financial crisis,
721	but have we invested them
721	in inclusive growth?
724.84	No, not yet.
727.8	Only when we build sufficient,
727.8	affordable public housing,
731.64	when we invest in robust
731.64	transportation networks
734.8	to allow people to connect to each other
734.8	both physically and digitally,
739.36	that's when our divided
739.36	cities and societies
741.76	will come to feel whole again.
743.64	(Applause)
747.84	And that is why infrastructure
747.84	has just been included
750.76	in the United Nations
750.76	Sustainable Development Goals,
753.24	because it enables all the others.
756.08	Our political and economic leaders
757.92	are learning that connectivity
757.92	is not charity,
761.04	it's opportunity.
763.08	And that's why our financial community
763.08	needs to understand
765.84	that connectivity is the most
765.84	important asset class of the 21st century.
772.28	Now, cities can make the world
772.28	more sustainable,
776.6	they can make the world more equitable,
778.88	I also believe that
778.88	connectivity between cities
781.76	can make the world more peaceful.
784.4	If we look at regions of the world
784.4	with dense relations across borders,
788.44	we see more trade, more investment
791.24	and more stability.
792.68	We all know the story
792.68	of Europe after World War II,
795.2	where industrial integration
795.2	kicked off a process
797.8	that gave rise to today's
797.8	peaceful European Union.
801	And you can see that Russia, by the way,
803.64	is the least connected of major powers
803.64	in the international system.
808.24	And that goes a long way
808.24	towards explaining the tensions today.
812.04	Countries that have
812.04	less stake in the system
814.96	also have less to lose in disturbing it.
818.8	In North America, the lines
818.8	that matter most on the map
821.64	are not the US-Canada border
821.64	or the US-Mexico border,
825.44	but the dense network of roads
825.44	and railways and pipelines
828.84	and electricity grids
828.84	and even water canals
831.72	that are forming an integrated
831.72	North American union.
835.56	North America does not need more walls,
835.56	it needs more connections.
840.28	(Applause)
847.88	But the real promise of connectivity
847.88	is in the postcolonial world.
852.24	All of those regions where borders
852.24	have historically been the most arbitrary
856.6	and where generations of leaders
858.56	have had hostile relations
858.56	with each other.
861.2	But now a new group of leaders
861.2	has come into power
863.6	and is burying the hatchet.
865.76	Let's take Southeast Asia,
865.76	where high-speed rail networks
868.96	are planned to connect
868.96	Bangkok to Singapore
871.28	and trade corridors
871.28	from Vietnam to Myanmar.
874.2	Now this region of 600 million people
874.2	coordinates its agricultural resources
879.76	and its industrial output.
881.72	It is evolving
881.72	into what I call a Pax Asiana,
886.4	a peace among Southeast Asian nations.
890.04	A similar phenomenon
890.04	is underway in East Africa,
893.2	where a half dozen countries
894.6	are investing in railways
894.6	and multimodal corridors
897.92	so that landlocked countries
897.92	can get their goods to market.
901.08	Now these countries
901.08	coordinate their utilities
903.68	and their investment policies.
905.8	They, too, are evolving
905.8	into a Pax Africana.
911.2	One region we know could
911.2	especially use this kind of thinking
914.12	is the Middle East.
916	As Arab states tragically collapse,
918.48	what is left behind
918.48	but the ancient cities,
921.24	such as Cairo, Beirut and Baghdad?
924.4	In fact, the nearly
929.16	are almost entirely urbanized.
931.28	As societies, as cities,
933.2	they are either water rich or water poor,
935.48	energy rich or energy poor.
938.04	And the only way
938.04	to correct these mismatches
940.96	is not through more wars and more borders,
943.6	but through more connectivity
943.6	of pipelines and water canals.
948.04	Sadly, this is not yet
948.04	the map of the Middle East.
952	But it should be,
954.76	a connected Pax Arabia,
958.64	internally integrated
960.36	and productively connected
960.36	to its neighbors: Europe, Asia and Africa.
964.68	Now, it may not seem like connectivity
964.68	is what we want right now
967.8	towards the world's most turbulent region.
970.6	But we know from history
970.6	that more connectivity is the only way
974.24	to bring about stability in the long run.
976.76	Because we know
976.76	that in region after region,
979.48	connectivity is the new reality.
982.44	Cities and countries
982.44	are learning to aggregate
985.6	into more peaceful and prosperous wholes.
989.76	But the real test is going to be Asia.
993.04	Can connectivity overcome
993.04	the patterns of rivalry
996	among the great powers of the Far East?
998.6	After all, this is where World War III
998.6	is supposed to break out.
1003.92	Since the end of the Cold War,
1003.92	a quarter century ago,
1007.08	at least six major wars
1007.08	have been predicted for this region.
1010.48	But none have broken out.
1013.16	Take China and Taiwan.
1015.56	In the 1990s, this was everyone's
1015.56	leading World War III scenario.
1020.2	But since that time,
1021.72	the trade and investment volumes
1021.72	across the straits have become so intense
1026.24	that last November,
1027.48	leaders from both sides
1027.48	held a historic summit
1030.36	to discuss eventual
1030.36	peaceful reunification.
1033.96	And even the election
1033.96	of a nationalist party in Taiwan
1036.8	that's pro-independence earlier this year
1039.599	does not undermine
1039.599	this fundamental dynamic.
1043.359	China and Japan have
1043.359	an even longer history of rivalry
1046.28	and have been deploying
1046.28	their air forces and navies
1048.72	to show their strength in island disputes.
1051.52	But in recent years,
1052.76	Japan has been making
1052.76	its largest foreign investments in China.
1056.92	Japanese cars are selling
1056.92	in record numbers there.
1060.44	And guess where
1060.44	the largest number of foreigners
1063.4	residing in Japan today comes from?
1066.12	You guessed it: China.
1069.52	China and India have fought a major war
1071.44	and have three outstanding
1071.44	border disputes,
1073.52	but today India is the second
1073.52	largest shareholder
1076	in the Asian Infrastructure
1076	Investment Bank.
1078.44	They're building a trade corridor
1078.44	stretching from Northeast India
1081.72	through Myanmar and Bangladesh
1081.72	to Southern China.
1086.32	Their trade volume has grown
1086.32	from 20 billion dollars a decade ago
1090.2	to 80 billion dollars today.
1092.6	Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan
1092.6	have fought three wars
1095.64	and continue to dispute Kashmir,
1097.88	but they're also negotiating
1097.88	a most-favored-nation trade agreement
1101.44	and want to complete a pipeline
1103.2	stretching from Iran
1103.2	through Pakistan to India.
1107.2	And let's talk about Iran.
1109.88	Wasn't it just two years ago
1109.88	that war with Iran seemed inevitable?
1113.76	Then why is every single major power
1113.76	rushing to do business there today?
1120.56	Ladies and gentlemen,
1121.84	I cannot guarantee
1121.84	that World War III will not break out.
1126.64	But we can definitely see
1126.64	why it hasn't happened yet.
1130.68	Even though Asia is home
1130.68	to the world's fastest growing militaries,
1134.4	these same countries
1134.4	are also investing billions of dollars
1138	in each other's infrastructure
1138	and supply chains.
1140.96	They are more interested
1140.96	in each other's functional geography
1144.8	than in their political geography.
1147.28	And that is why their leaders think twice,
1147.28	step back from the brink,
1152.36	and decide to focus on economic ties
1152.36	over territorial tensions.
1158.44	So often it seems
1158.44	like the world is falling apart,
1161.76	but building more connectivity
1163.72	is how we put Humpty Dumpty
1163.72	back together again,
1167.48	much better than before.
1169.96	And by wrapping the world
1171.24	in such seamless physical
1171.24	and digital connectivity,
1174.72	we evolve towards a world
1176.92	in which people can rise
1176.92	above their geographic constraints.
1180.92	We are the cells and vessels
1184.12	pulsing through these global
1184.12	connectivity networks.
1187.36	Everyday, hundreds of millions
1187.36	of people go online
1191.04	and work with people they've never met.
1193.68	More than one billion people
1193.68	cross borders every year,
1197.2	and that's expected to rise
1197.2	to three billion in the coming decade.
1202.2	We don't just build connectivity,
1204.72	we embody it.
1206.96	We are the global network civilization,
1210.32	and this is our map.
1213.24	A map of the world in which
1213.24	geography is no longer destiny.
1218.56	Instead, the future
1218.56	has a new and more hopeful motto:
1223.4	connectivity is destiny.
1226.04	Thank you.
1227.28	(Applause)
