15.805	I grew up watching Star Trek. I love Star Trek.
19.337	Star Trek made me want to see alien creatures,
23.799	creatures from a far-distant world.
26.102	But basically, I figured out that I could find
28.889	those alien creatures right on Earth.
31.866	And what I do is I study insects.
34.519	I'm obsessed with insects, particularly insect flight.
37.775	I think the evolution of insect flight is perhaps
40.916	one of the most important events in the history of life.
43.658	Without insects, there'd be no flowering plants.
45.895	Without flowering plants, there would be no
47.811	clever, fruit-eating primates giving TED Talks.
50.948	(Laughter)
53.248	Now,
55.235	David and Hidehiko and Ketaki
58.274	gave a very compelling story about
61.719	the similarities between fruit flies and humans,
64.524	and there are many similarities,
66.013	and so you might think that if humans are similar to fruit flies,
69.015	the favorite behavior of a fruit fly might be this, for example --
72.812	(Laughter)
75.094	but in my talk, I don't want to emphasize on the similarities
78.285	between humans and fruit flies, but rather the differences,
81.352	and focus on the behaviors that I think fruit flies excel at doing.
86.639	And so I want to show you a high-speed video sequence
89.495	of a fly shot at 7,000 frames per second in infrared lighting,
93.43	and to the right, off-screen, is an electronic looming predator
97.64	that is going to go at the fly.
99.075	The fly is going to sense this predator.
100.913	It is going to extend its legs out.
103.368	It's going to sashay away
104.981	to live to fly another day.
107.546	Now I have carefully cropped this sequence
109.908	to be exactly the duration of a human eye blink,
113.068	so in the time that it would take you to blink your eye,
115.902	the fly has seen this looming predator,
119.167	estimated its position, initiated a motor pattern to fly it away,
125.335	beating its wings at 220 times a second as it does so.
129.799	I think this is a fascinating behavior
131.772	that shows how fast the fly's brain can process information.
135.693	Now, flight -- what does it take to fly?
138.535	Well, in order to fly, just as in a human aircraft,
141.399	you need wings that can generate sufficient aerodynamic forces,
144.134	you need an engine sufficient to generate the power required for flight,
147.68	and you need a controller,
149.389	and in the first human aircraft, the controller was basically
152.015	the brain of Orville and Wilbur sitting in the cockpit.
156.327	Now, how does this compare to a fly?
159.08	Well, I spent a lot of my early career trying to figure out
162.331	how insect wings generate enough force to keep the flies in the air.
166.667	And you might have heard how engineers proved
168.277	that bumblebees couldn't fly.
170.911	Well, the problem was in thinking that the insect wings
173.531	function in the way that aircraft wings work. But they don't.
176.65	And we tackle this problem by building giant,
179.504	dynamically scaled model robot insects
182.936	that would flap in giant pools of mineral oil
186.272	where we could study the aerodynamic forces.
188.546	And it turns out that the insects flap their wings
190.704	in a very clever way, at a very high angle of attack
193.296	that creates a structure at the leading edge of the wing,
196.417	a little tornado-like structure called a leading edge vortex,
199.616	and it's that vortex that actually enables the wings
202.57	to make enough force for the animal to stay in the air.
205.929	But the thing that's actually most -- so, what's fascinating
208.357	is not so much that the wing has some interesting morphology.
211.332	What's clever is the way the fly flaps it,
214.977	which of course ultimately is controlled by the nervous system,
218.113	and this is what enables flies to perform
220.76	these remarkable aerial maneuvers.
223.567	Now, what about the engine?
225.664	The engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating.
228.156	They have two types of flight muscle:
230.054	so-called power muscle, which is stretch-activated,
233.039	which means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled
236.765	on a contraction-by-contraction basis by the nervous system.
240.104	It's specialized to generate the enormous power required for flight,
244.713	and it fills the middle portion of the fly,
246.792	so when a fly hits your windshield,
248.339	it's basically the power muscle that you're looking at.
250.745	But attached to the base of the wing
252.891	is a set of little, tiny control muscles
255.529	that are not very powerful at all, but they're very fast,
258.83	and they're able to reconfigure the hinge of the wing
262.036	on a stroke-by-stroke basis,
263.798	and this is what enables the fly to change its wing
266.94	and generate the changes in aerodynamic forces
269.911	which change its flight trajectory.
272.484	And of course, the role of the nervous system is to control all this.
276.047	So let's look at the controller.
277.559	Now flies excel in the sorts of sensors
280.206	that they carry to this problem.
282.49	They have antennae that sense odors and detect wind detection.
286.617	They have a sophisticated eye which is
288.292	the fastest visual system on the planet.
290.748	They have another set of eyes on the top of their head.
292.784	We have no idea what they do.
294.836	They have sensors on their wing.
297.79	Their wing is covered with sensors, including sensors
301.55	that sense deformation of the wing.
303.596	They can even taste with their wings.
305.705	One of the most sophisticated sensors a fly has
308.26	is a structure called the halteres.
310.067	The halteres are actually gyroscopes.
311.946	These devices beat back and forth about 200 hertz during flight,
316.395	and the animal can use them to sense its body rotation
319.068	and initiate very, very fast corrective maneuvers.
323.036	But all of this sensory information has to be processed
325.365	by a brain, and yes, indeed, flies have a brain,
329.085	a brain of about 100,000 neurons.
332.244	Now several people at this conference
334.437	have already suggested that fruit flies could serve neuroscience
339.245	because they're a simple model of brain function.
342.492	And the basic punchline of my talk is,
344.569	I'd like to turn that over on its head.
347.227	I don't think they're a simple model of anything.
349.855	And I think that flies are a great model.
352.332	They're a great model for flies.
354.848	(Laughter)
357.329	And let's explore this notion of simplicity.
360.332	So I think, unfortunately, a lot of neuroscientists,
362.763	we're all somewhat narcissistic.
364.595	When we think of brain, we of course imagine our own brain.
368.028	But remember that this kind of brain,
369.988	which is much, much smaller
371.756	— instead of 100 billion neurons, it has 100,000 neurons —
374.434	but this is the most common form of brain on the planet
377.316	and has been for 400 million years.
380.22	And is it fair to say that it's simple?
382.508	Well, it's simple in the sense that it has fewer neurons,
384.603	but is that a fair metric?
386.357	And I would propose it's not a fair metric.
388.633	So let's sort of think about this. I think we have to compare --
391.733	(Laughter) —
393.292	we have to compare the size of the brain
398.413	with what the brain can do.
400.443	So I propose we have a Trump number,
403.324	and the Trump number is the ratio of this man's
406.189	behavioral repertoire to the number of neurons in his brain.
409.868	We'll calculate the Trump number for the fruit fly.
412.536	Now, how many people here think the Trump number
415.22	is higher for the fruit fly?
417.709	(Applause)
420.14	It's a very smart, smart audience.
423.568	Yes, the inequality goes in this direction, or I would posit it.
426.895	Now I realize that it is a little bit absurd
429.277	to compare the behavioral repertoire of a human to a fly.
432.835	But let's take another animal just as an example. Here's a mouse.
436.978	A mouse has about 1,000 times as many neurons as a fly.
441.283	I used to study mice. When I studied mice,
443.31	I used to talk really slowly.
446.147	And then something happened when I started to work on flies.
448.723	(Laughter)
451.135	And I think if you compare the natural history of flies and mice,
454.595	it's really comparable. They have to forage for food.
457.908	They have to engage in courtship.
460.355	They have sex. They hide from predators.
463.826	They do a lot of the similar things.
465.806	But I would argue that flies do more.
467.524	So for example, I'm going to show you a sequence,
470.902	and I have to say, some of my funding comes from the military,
475.107	so I'm showing this classified sequence
477.179	and you cannot discuss it outside of this room. Okay?
481.272	So I want you to look at the payload
483.18	at the tail of the fruit fly.
486.206	Watch it very closely,
488.307	and you'll see why my six-year-old son
492.604	now wants to be a neuroscientist.
497.333	Wait for it.
498.512	Pshhew.
500.081	So at least you'll admit that if fruit flies are not as clever as mice,
503.165	they're at least as clever as pigeons. (Laughter)
508.081	Now, I want to get across that it's not just a matter of numbers
512.048	but also the challenge for a fly to compute
514.646	everything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons.
517.495	So this is a beautiful image of a visual interneuron from a mouse
520.483	that came from Jeff Lichtman's lab,
523.251	and you can see the wonderful images of brains
526.498	that he showed in his talk.
529.691	But up in the corner, in the right corner, you'll see,
532.059	at the same scale, a visual interneuron from a fly.
536.171	And I'll expand this up.
538.012	And it's a beautifully complex neuron.
540.182	It's just very, very tiny, and there's lots of biophysical challenges
543.667	with trying to compute information with tiny, tiny neurons.
547.29	How small can neurons get? Well, look at this interesting insect.
550.827	It looks sort of like a fly. It has wings, it has eyes,
553.039	it has antennae, its legs, complicated life history,
555.838	it's a parasite, it has to fly around and find caterpillars
558.934	to parasatize,
560.316	but not only is its brain the size of a salt grain,
564.431	which is comparable for a fruit fly,
566.4	it is the size of a salt grain.
569.326	So here's some other organisms at the similar scale.
572.961	This animal is the size of a paramecium and an amoeba,
577.091	and it has a brain of 7,000 neurons that's so small --
580.971	you know these things called cell bodies you've been hearing about,
583.427	where the nucleus of the neuron is?
585.078	This animal gets rid of them because they take up too much space.
588.538	So this is a session on frontiers in neuroscience.
591.011	I would posit that one frontier in neuroscience is to figure out how the brain of that thing works.
596.371	But let's think about this. How can you make a small number of neurons do a lot?
602.004	And I think, from an engineering perspective,
604.526	you think of multiplexing.
606.255	You can take a hardware and have that hardware
608.958	do different things at different times,
610.571	or have different parts of the hardware doing different things.
613.566	And these are the two concepts I'd like to explore.
616.837	And they're not concepts that I've come up with,
618.495	but concepts that have been proposed by others in the past.
623.04	And one idea comes from lessons from chewing crabs.
626.115	And I don't mean chewing the crabs.
627.982	I grew up in Baltimore, and I chew crabs very, very well.
631.581	But I'm talking about the crabs actually doing the chewing.
634.438	Crab chewing is actually really fascinating.
636.468	Crabs have this complicated structure under their carapace
639.727	called the gastric mill
641.037	that grinds their food in a variety of different ways.
643.467	And here's an endoscopic movie of this structure.
648.726	The amazing thing about this is that it's controlled
651.286	by a really tiny set of neurons, about two dozen neurons
654.718	that can produce a vast variety of different motor patterns,
659.681	and the reason it can do this is that this little tiny ganglion
664.028	in the crab is actually inundated by many, many neuromodulators.
668.212	You heard about neuromodulators earlier.
670.353	There are more neuromodulators
672.578	that alter, that innervate this structure than actually neurons in the structure,
678.063	and they're able to generate a complicated set of patterns.
682.305	And this is the work by Eve Marder and her many colleagues
685.746	who've been studying this fascinating system
688.041	that show how a smaller cluster of neurons
690.193	can do many, many, many things
692.018	because of neuromodulation that can take place on a moment-by-moment basis.
696.874	So this is basically multiplexing in time.
699.313	Imagine a network of neurons with one neuromodulator.
702.098	You select one set of cells to perform one sort of behavior,
705.576	another neuromodulator, another set of cells,
708.194	a different pattern, and you can imagine
709.907	you could extrapolate to a very, very complicated system.
713.785	Is there any evidence that flies do this?
715.879	Well, for many years in my laboratory and other laboratories around the world,
719.254	we've been studying fly behaviors in little flight simulators.
721.902	You can tether a fly to a little stick.
723.608	You can measure the aerodynamic forces it's creating.
726.109	You can let the fly play a little video game
728.655	by letting it fly around in a visual display.
732.533	So let me show you a little tiny sequence of this.
734.87	Here's a fly
736.097	and a large infrared view of the fly in the flight simulator,
739.534	and this is a game the flies love to play.
741.489	You allow them to steer towards the little stripe,
743.926	and they'll just steer towards that stripe forever.
746.751	It's part of their visual guidance system.
750.309	But very, very recently, it's been possible
752.654	to modify these sorts of behavioral arenas for physiologies.
757.594	So this is the preparation that one of my former post-docs,
760.082	Gaby Maimon, who's now at Rockefeller, developed,
762.525	and it's basically a flight simulator
764.211	but under conditions where you actually can stick an electrode
767.286	in the brain of the fly and record
769.55	from a genetically identified neuron in the fly's brain.
773.206	And this is what one of these experiments looks like.
775.504	It was a sequence taken from another post-doc in the lab,
778.475	Bettina Schnell.
779.674	The green trace at the bottom is the membrane potential
783.066	of a neuron in the fly's brain,
785.096	and you'll see the fly start to fly, and the fly is actually
788.038	controlling the rotation of that visual pattern itself
791.317	by its own wing motion,
792.796	and you can see this visual interneuron
794.906	respond to the pattern of wing motion as the fly flies.
798.814	So for the first time we've actually been able to record
801.19	from neurons in the fly's brain while the fly
804.098	is performing sophisticated behaviors such as flight.
808.566	And one of the lessons we've been learning
810.421	is that the physiology of cells that we've been studying
812.841	for many years in quiescent flies
815.262	is not the same as the physiology of those cells
817.91	when the flies actually engage in active behaviors
820.646	like flying and walking and so forth.
823.185	And why is the physiology different?
826.11	Well it turns out it's these neuromodulators,
828.167	just like the neuromodulators in that little tiny ganglion in the crabs.
832.118	So here's a picture of the octopamine system.
834.668	Octopamine is a neuromodulator
836.422	that seems to play an important role in flight and other behaviors.
840.758	But this is just one of many neuromodulators
843.23	that's in the fly's brain.
844.301	So I really think that, as we learn more,
846.967	it's going to turn out that the whole fly brain
849.494	is just like a large version of this stomatogastric ganglion,
852.583	and that's one of the reasons why it can do so much with so few neurons.
856.943	Now, another idea, another way of multiplexing
859.73	is multiplexing in space,
861.386	having different parts of a neuron
863.08	do different things at the same time.
865.202	So here's two sort of canonical neurons
867.035	from a vertebrate and an invertebrate,
869.32	a human pyramidal neuron from Ramon y Cajal,
872.57	and another cell to the right, a non-spiking interneuron,
876.573	and this is the work of Alan Watson and Malcolm Burrows many years ago,
880.72	and Malcolm Burrows came up with a pretty interesting idea
883.795	based on the fact that this neuron from a locust
886.677	does not fire action potentials.
888.636	It's a non-spiking cell.
890.384	So a typical cell, like the neurons in our brain,
893.164	has a region called the dendrites that receives input,
895.916	and that input sums together
898.505	and will produce action potentials
900.801	that run down the axon and then activate
903.132	all the output regions of the neuron.
905.428	But non-spiking neurons are actually quite complicated
908.304	because they can have input synapses and output synapses
911.416	all interdigitated, and there's no single action potential
915.079	that drives all the outputs at the same time.
918.205	So there's a possibility that you have computational compartments
922.112	that allow the different parts of the neuron
926.09	to do different things at the same time.
928.65	So these basic concepts of multitasking in time
933.321	and multitasking in space,
935.682	I think these are things that are true in our brains as well,
938.514	but I think the insects are the true masters of this.
941.091	So I hope you think of insects a little bit differently next time,
944.207	and as I say up here, please think before you swat.
947.142	(Applause)
