13.441	Speaking up is hard to do.
16.588	I understood the true meaning
16.588	of this phrase exactly one month ago,
21.531	when my wife and I became new parents.
25.113	It was an amazing moment.
26.815	It was exhilarating and elating,
29.024	but it was also scary and terrifying.
32.369	And it got particularly terrifying
32.369	when we got home from the hospital,
36.595	and we were unsure
38.08	whether our little baby boy was getting
38.08	enough nutrients from breastfeeding.
42.616	And we wanted to call our pediatrician,
45.967	but we also didn't want
45.967	to make a bad first impression
48.566	or come across as a crazy,
48.566	neurotic parent.
51.054	So we worried.
52.725	And we waited.
54.131	When we got to the doctor's office
54.131	the next day,
56.45	she immediately gave him formula
56.45	because he was pretty dehydrated.
61.312	Our son is fine now,
62.77	and our doctor has reassured us
62.77	we can always contact her.
66.106	But in that moment,
67.656	I should've spoken up, but I didn't.
70.943	But sometimes we speak up
70.943	when we shouldn't,
74.262	and I learned that over 10 years ago
74.262	when I let my twin brother down.
78.579	My twin brother
78.579	is a documentary filmmaker,
81.245	and for one of his first films,
82.799	he got an offer
82.799	from a distribution company.
85.438	He was excited,
86.8	and he was inclined to accept the offer.
89.491	But as a negotiations researcher,
91.608	I insisted he make a counteroffer,
94.585	and I helped him craft the perfect one.
97.839	And it was perfect --
99.544	it was perfectly insulting.
102.423	The company was so offended,
104.16	they literally withdrew the offer
106.233	and my brother was left with nothing.
108.474	And I've asked people all over the world
108.474	about this dilemma of speaking up:
112.358	when they can assert themselves,
114.216	when they can push their interests,
115.954	when they can express an opinion,
118.173	when they can make an ambitious ask.
120.887	And the range of stories
120.887	are varied and diverse,
125.144	but they also make up
125.144	a universal tapestry.
127.839	Can I correct my boss
127.839	when they make a mistake?
130.541	Can I confront my coworker
130.541	who keeps stepping on my toes?
134.996	Can I challenge my friend's
134.996	insensitive joke?
138.39	Can I tell the person I love the most
138.39	my deepest insecurities?
142.963	And through these experiences,
142.963	I've come to recognize
145.7	that each of us have something called
145.7	a range of acceptable behavior.
149.581	Now, sometimes we're too strong;
149.581	we push ourselves too much.
154.856	That's what happened with my brother.
156.643	Even making an offer was outside
156.643	his range of acceptable behavior.
161.663	But sometimes we're too weak.
163.211	That's what happened with my wife and I.
165.299	And this range of acceptable behaviors --
167.539	when we stay within our range,
167.539	we're rewarded.
170.658	When we step outside that range,
170.658	we get punished in a variety of ways.
174.851	We get dismissed or demeaned
174.851	or even ostracized.
178.014	Or we lose that raise
178.014	or that promotion or that deal.
181.929	Now, the first thing we need to know is:
184.717	What is my range?
186.744	But the key thing is,
186.744	our range isn't fixed;
191.265	it's actually pretty dynamic.
192.705	It expands and it narrows
192.705	based on the context.
197.344	And there's one thing that determines
197.344	that range more than anything else,
202.038	and that's your power.
203.355	Your power determines your range.
205.536	What is power?
206.997	Power comes in lots of forms.
208.788	In negotiations, it comes
208.788	in the form of alternatives.
211.901	So my brother had no alternatives;
213.925	he lacked power.
215.136	The company had lots of alternatives;
216.98	they had power.
218.17	Sometimes it's being new
218.17	to a country, like an immigrant,
221.254	or new to an organization
222.737	or new to an experience,
224.32	like my wife and I as new parents.
226.449	Sometimes it's at work,
227.974	where someone's the boss
227.974	and someone's the subordinate.
230.609	Sometimes it's in relationships,
232.317	where one person's more invested
232.317	than the other person.
235.322	And the key thing is that when
235.322	we have lots of power,
238.861	our range is very wide.
240.714	We have a lot of leeway in how to behave.
243.813	But when we lack power, our range narrows.
246.537	We have very little leeway.
248.947	The problem is that when
248.947	our range narrows,
251.753	that produces something called
251.753	the low-power double bind.
256.31	The low-power double bind happens
259.007	when, if we don't speak up,
259.007	we go unnoticed,
262.576	but if we do speak up, we get punished.
265.359	Now, many of you have heard
265.359	"the phrase the ""double bind"""
268.094	and connected it with one thing,
268.094	and that's gender.
271.065	The gender double bind is women
271.065	who don't speak up go unnoticed,
275.299	and women who do speak up get punished.
278.127	And the key thing is that women have
278.127	the same need as men to speak up,
283.135	but they have barriers to doing so.
286.004	But what my research has shown
286.004	over the last two decades
289.306	is that what looks
289.306	like a gender difference
293.035	is not really a gender double bind,
295.456	it's a really a low-power double bind.
297.836	And what looks like a gender difference
299.744	are really often just power
299.744	differences in disguise.
303.394	Oftentimes we see a difference
303.394	between a man and a woman
306.141	or men and women,
307.363	"and think, ""Biological cause."
307.363	There's something fundamentally different
310.995	"about the sexes."""
312.265	But in study after study,
314.143	I've found that a better explanation
314.143	for many sex differences
318.893	is really power.
320.429	And so it's the low-power double bind.
323.975	And the low-power double bind
323.975	means that we have a narrow range,
328.815	and we lack power.
330.669	We have a narrow range,
331.925	and our double bind is very large.
334.335	So we need to find ways
334.335	to expand our range.
336.715	And over the last couple decades,
338.316	my colleagues and I have found
338.316	two things really matter.
341.887	The first: you seem powerful
341.887	in your own eyes.
346.284	The second: you seem powerful
346.284	in the eyes of others.
349.629	When I feel powerful,
352.117	I feel confident, not fearful;
354.016	I expand my own range.
355.882	When other people see me as powerful,
358.614	they grant me a wider range.
361.174	So we need tools to expand
361.174	our range of acceptable behavior.
365.952	And I'm going to give you
365.952	a set of tools today.
368.367	Speaking up is risky,
370.503	but these tools will lower
370.503	your risk of speaking up.
375.067	The first tool I'm going to give you
375.067	got discovered in negotiations
380.925	in an important finding.
382.329	On average, women make
382.329	less ambitious offers
386.249	and get worse outcomes than men
386.249	at the bargaining table.
390.2	But Hannah Riley Bowles
390.2	and Emily Amanatullah have discovered
393.341	there's one situation
393.341	where women get the same outcomes as men
397.043	and are just as ambitious.
399.196	That's when they advocate for others.
403.251	When they advocate for others,
405.412	they discover their own range
405.412	and expand it in their own mind.
410.313	They become more assertive.
411.746	This is sometimes called
411.746	"""the mama bear effect."""
415.483	Like a mama bear defending her cubs,
417.766	when we advocate for others,
417.766	we can discover our own voice.
422.328	But sometimes, we have
422.328	to advocate for ourselves.
425.469	How do we do that?
426.833	One of the most important tools
426.833	we have to advocate for ourselves
430.862	is something called perspective-taking.
433.258	And perspective-taking is really simple:
436.034	it's simply looking at the world
436.034	through the eyes of another person.
441.014	It's one of the most important tools
441.014	we have to expand our range.
444.826	When I take your perspective,
446.557	and I think about what you really want,
449.02	you're more likely to give me
449.02	what I really want.
453.461	But here's the problem:
454.985	perspective-taking is hard to do.
457.29	So let's do a little experiment.
458.844	I want you all to hold
458.844	your hand just like this:
461.882	your finger -- put it up.
463.77	And I want you to draw
463.77	a capital letter E on your forehead
468.026	as quickly as possible.
472.066	OK, it turns out that we can
472.066	draw this E in one of two ways,
475.407	and this was originally designed
475.407	as a test of perspective-taking.
478.916	I'm going to show you two pictures
480.861	of someone with an E on their forehead --
482.885	my former student, Erika Hall.
485.294	And you can see over here,
487.286	that's the correct E.
488.577	I drew the E so it looks like
488.577	an E to another person.
492.051	That's the perspective-taking E
494.182	because it looks like an E
494.182	from someone else's vantage point.
497.261	But this E over here
497.261	is the self-focused E.
500.856	We often get self-focused.
502.533	And we particularly get
502.533	self-focused in a crisis.
506.064	I want to tell you
506.064	about a particular crisis.
508.259	A man walks into a bank
508.259	in Watsonville, California.
512.285	"And he says, ""Give me $2,000,"
514.748	or I'm blowing the whole bank
514.748	"up with a bomb."""
517.503	Now, the bank manager
517.503	didn't give him the money.
520.052	She took a step back.
521.873	She took his perspective,
523.353	and she noticed something
523.353	really important.
525.744	He asked for a specific amount of money.
528.474	So she said,
530.669	"""Why did you ask for $2,000?"""
533.265	"And he said, ""My friend"
533.265	is going to be evicted
535.657	"unless I get him $2,000 immediately."""
537.944	"And she said, ""Oh! You don't want"
537.944	to rob the bank --
541.018	"you want to take out a loan."""
542.53	(Laughter)
543.639	"""Why don't you come back to my office,"
545.536	and we can have you
545.536	"fill out the paperwork."""
547.739	(Laughter)
549.214	Now, her quick perspective-taking
549.214	defused a volatile situation.
554.276	So when we take someone's perspective,
556.119	it allows us to be ambitious
556.119	and assertive, but still be likable.
561.182	Here's another way to be assertive
561.182	but still be likable,
564.474	and that is to signal flexibility.
567.413	Now, imagine you're a car salesperson,
567.413	and you want to sell someone a car.
571.79	You're going to more likely make the sale
571.79	if you give them two options.
576.141	Let's say option A:
577.588	$24,000 for this car
577.588	and a five-year warranty.
581.084	Or option B:
582.701	$23,000 and a three-year warranty.
585.845	My research shows that when you give
585.845	people a choice among options,
589.447	it lowers their defenses,
591.36	and they're more likely
591.36	to accept your offer.
594.202	And this doesn't just
594.202	work with salespeople;
596.343	it works with parents.
597.558	When my niece was four,
598.861	she resisted getting dressed
598.861	and rejected everything.
602.16	But then my sister-in-law
602.16	had a brilliant idea.
605.079	What if I gave my daughter a choice?
607.654	This shirt or that shirt? OK, that shirt.
609.699	This pant or that pant? OK, that pant.
611.845	And it worked brilliantly.
613.207	She got dressed quickly
613.207	and without resistance.
617.498	When I've asked the question
617.498	around the world
619.809	when people feel comfortable speaking up,
621.884	the number one answer is:
623.244	"""When I have social support"
623.244	"in my audience; when I have allies."""
628.022	So we want to get allies on our side.
631.957	How do we do that?
633.841	Well, one of the ways is be a mama bear.
636.034	When we advocate for others,
637.534	we expand our range in our own eyes
637.534	and the eyes of others,
641.087	but we also earn strong allies.
643.806	Another way we can earn strong allies,
643.806	especially in high places,
648.537	is by asking other people for advice.
651.41	When we ask others for advice,
651.41	they like us because we flatter them,
657.315	and we're expressing humility.
659.281	And this really works to solve
659.281	another double bind.
662.831	And that's the self-promotion double bind.
665.498	The self-promotion double bind
667.026	is that if we don't advertise
667.026	our accomplishments,
670.205	no one notices.
671.439	And if we do, we're not likable.
673.867	But if we ask for advice
673.867	about one of our accomplishments,
677.457	we are able to be competent
677.457	in their eyes but also be likeable.
682.495	And this is so powerful
684.526	it even works when you see it coming.
687.469	There have been multiple times in life
687.469	when I have been forewarned
691.533	that a low-power person has been given
691.533	the advice to come ask me for advice.
696.289	I want you to notice
696.289	three things about this:
698.555	First, I knew they were going
698.555	to come ask me for advice.
701.93	Two, I've actually done research
701.93	on the strategic benefits
705.956	of asking for advice.
707.882	And three, it still worked!
710.656	I took their perspective,
711.897	I became more invested in their cause,
714.108	I became more committed to them
714.108	because they asked for advice.
718.343	Now, another time we feel
718.343	more confident speaking up
721.949	is when we have expertise.
724.144	Expertise gives us credibility.
726.862	When we have high power,
726.862	we already have credibility.
729.813	We only need good evidence.
731.777	When we lack power,
731.777	we don't have the credibility.
734.771	We need excellent evidence.
737.394	And one of the ways
737.394	we can come across as an expert
741.165	is by tapping into our passion.
743.784	I want everyone in the next few days
743.784	to go up to friend of theirs
747.982	and just say to them,
749.251	"""I want you to describe"
749.251	"a passion of yours to me."""
752.738	I've had people do this all over the world
755.247	and I asked them,
756.527	"""What did you notice"
756.527	about the other person
758.72	"when they described their passion?"""
760.798	And the answers are always the same.
762.722	"""Their eyes lit up and got big."""
764.754	"""They smiled a big beaming smile."""
767.727	"""They used their hands all over --"
769.395	I had to duck because their
769.395	"hands were coming at me."""
771.911	"""They talk quickly"
771.911	"with a little higher pitch."""
774.136	(Laughter)
775.134	"""They leaned in"
775.134	"as if telling me a secret."""
777.602	And then I said to them,
778.947	"""What happened to you"
778.947	"as you listened to their passion?"""
782.374	"They said, ""My eyes lit up."
784.678	I smiled.
785.972	"I leaned in."""
787.369	When we tap into our passion,
789.462	we give ourselves the courage,
789.462	in our own eyes, to speak up,
792.852	but we also get the permission
792.852	from others to speak up.
796.534	Tapping into our passion even works
796.534	when we come across as too weak.
802.533	Both men and women get punished
802.533	at work when they shed tears.
807.344	But Lizzie Wolf has shown that when
807.344	we frame our strong emotions as passion,
813.786	the condemnation of our crying
813.786	disappears for both men and women.
820.598	I want to end with a few words
820.598	from my late father
824.09	that he spoke at my twin
824.09	brother's wedding.
826.675	Here's a picture of us.
829.664	My dad was a psychologist like me,
831.945	but his real love and his real
831.945	passion was cinema,
835.691	like my brother.
836.915	And so he wrote a speech
836.915	for my brother's wedding
839.505	about the roles we play
839.505	in the human comedy.
842.678	"And he said, ""The lighter your touch,"
844.991	the better you become at improving
844.991	and enriching your performance.
849.17	Those who embrace their roles
849.17	and work to improve their performance
854.001	grow, change and expand the self.
857.067	Play it well,
858.399	"and your days will be mostly joyful."""
860.946	What my dad was saying
862.595	is that we've all been assigned
862.595	ranges and roles in this world.
867.048	But he was also saying
867.048	the essence of this talk:
871.005	those roles and ranges are constantly
871.005	expanding and evolving.
876.77	So when a scene calls for it,
879.114	be a ferocious mama bear
881.251	and a humble advice seeker.
883.802	Have excellent evidence and strong allies.
887.91	Be a passionate perspective taker.
890.77	And if you use those tools --
892.514	and each and every one of you
892.514	can use these tools --
896.104	you will expand your range
896.104	of acceptable behavior,
899.994	and your days will be mostly joyful.
904.082	Thank you.
905.256	(Applause)
