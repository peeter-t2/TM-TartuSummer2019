12.152	Let me start by asking you a
12.152	question, just with a show of hands:
15.101	Who has an iPhone?
17.236	Who has an Android phone?
20.326	Who has a Blackberry?
22.394	Who will admit in public to having a Blackberry?
24.768	(Laughter)
27.351	And let me guess, how many of you,
29.439	when you arrived here, like me, went and bought
31.447	a pay-as-you-go SIM card? Yeah?
35.237	I'll bet you didn't even know
36.637	you're using African technology.
38.615	Pay-as-you-go was a technology, or an idea,
40.898	pioneered in Africa by a company called Vodacom
43.968	a good 15 years ago,
46.371	and now, like franchising,
48.916	pay-as-you-go is one of the most dominant forces
51.199	of economic activity in the world.
53.776	So I'm going to talk about innovation in Africa,
55.668	which I think is the purest form,
57.738	innovation out of necessity.
59.746	But first, I'm going to ask you some other questions.
62.208	You don't have to put your hands up.
63.843	These are rhetorical.
66.475	Why did Nikola Tesla have to invent
68.745	the alternating current that powers the lights
70.746	in this building or the city that we're in?
73.277	Why did Henry Ford have to
73.277	invent the production line
75.965	to produce these Fords that came in anything
78.582	as long as they were black?
80.043	And why did Eric Merrifield
80.043	have to invent the dolos?
84.822	Blank stares. That is what a dolos looks like,
87.42	and in the background, you can see Robben Island.
90.241	This is a small dolos, and Eric Merrifield
94.29	is the most famous inventor you've never heard of.
97.053	In 1963, a storm ripped up the harbor
101.273	in a small South African town called East London,
103.645	and while he was watching his kids playing
106.688	with toys made from oxen bones called dolosse,
109.234	he had the idea for this.
110.856	It's a bit like a huge jumping jack,
113.073	and they have used this in every harbor in the world
116.515	as a breakwater.
118.135	The global shipping economy would not be possible
121.324	without African technology like this.
124.224	So whenever you talk about Africa,
127.973	you have to put up this picture
127.973	of the world from space,
130.9	"and people go, ""Look, it's the Dark Continent."""
134.727	Actually, it isn't.
136.386	What it is is a map of innovation.
138.415	And it's really easy to see
138.415	where innovation's going on.
141.9	All the places with lots of electricity, it isn't.
145.96	(Laughter)
148.987	(Applause)
153.52	And the reason it isn't is because everybody's
155.97	watching television or playing Angry Birds.
159.155	(Laughter) (Applause)
162.624	So where it's happening is in Africa.
165.828	Now, this is real innovation,
167.646	not the way people have expropriated the word
170.801	to talk about launching new products.
172.994	This is real innovation, and I
172.994	define it as problem-solving.
176.751	People are solving real problems in Africa.
179.315	Why? Because we have to.
181.581	Because we have real problems.
183.314	And when we solve real problems for people,
185.91	we solve them for the rest of the world
188.307	at the same time.
190.411	So in California, everybody's really excited
193.746	about a little square of plastic
193.746	that you plug into a phone
196.752	and you can swipe your credit card,
198.443	"and people say, ""We've liberated the credit card"
201.322	"from the point of sale terminal."""
203.996	Fantastic. Why do you even need a credit card?
207.41	In Africa, we've been doing that for years,
210.758	and we've been doing it on phones like this.
212.76	This is a picture I took at a place called Kitengela,
215.294	about an hour south of Nairobi,
217.243	and the thing that's so remarkable
217.243	about the payment system
220.123	that's been pioneered in Africa called M-Pesa
222.325	is that it works on phones like this.
225.069	It works on every single phone possible,
228.835	because it uses SMS.
230.653	You can pay bills with it, 
230.653	you can buy your groceries,
233.551	you can pay your kids' school fees,
235.549	and I'm told you can even bribe customs officials.
239.582	(Laughter)
241.063	Something like 25 million dollars a day
244.055	is transacted through M-Pesa.
246.226	Forty percent of Kenya's GDP
248.537	moves through M-Pesa using phones like this.
251.738	And you think this is just a feature phone.
253.828	Actually it's the smartphone of Africa.
256.9	It's also a radio, and it's also a torch,
259.359	and more than anything else,
260.771	it has really superb battery life.
263.539	Why? Because that's what we need.
265.641	We have really severe energy problems in Africa.
269.054	By the way, you can update Facebook
270.599	and send Gmail from a phone like this.
274.272	So we have found a way to use
276.852	the available technology to send money via M-Pesa,
279.745	which is a bit like a check system
281.766	for the mobile age.
284.008	I come from Johannesburg, which is a mining town.
286.63	It's built on gold.
288.094	This is a picture I Instagrammed earlier.
290.383	And the difference today is that 
290.383	the gold of today is mobile.
295.748	If you think about the railroad system
295.748	in North America and how that worked,
299.991	first came the infrastructure,
301.873	then came the industry around it, the brothels --
305.153	it's a bit like the Internet today, right? â€”
307.145	and everything else that worked with it:
309.613	bars, saloons, etc.
311.68	The gold of today is mobile,
313.898	and mobile is the enabler
313.898	that makes all of this possible.
316.919	So what are some of the
316.919	things that you can do with it?
318.945	Well, this is by a guy called
318.945	Bright Simons from Ghana,
322.531	and what you do is you take medication,
324.945	something that some people might
324.945	spend their entire month's salary on,
328.183	and you scratch off the code,
330.948	and you send that to an SMS number,
332.89	and it tells you if that is legitimate
334.885	or if it's expired.
336.675	Really simple, really effective, really life-saving.
340.244	In Kenya, there's a service called iCow,
342.433	which just sends you really important information
345.372	about how to look after your dairy.
347.25	The dairy business in Kenya
348.791	is a $463 million business,
351.597	and the difference between a subsistence farmer
354.214	and an abundance farmer
355.911	is only a couple of liters of milk a day.
358.285	And if you can do that,
358.285	you can rise out of poverty.
361.305	Really simple, using a basic phone.
365.276	If you don't have electricity, no problem!
368.061	We'll just make it out of old bicycle parts
370.022	using a windmill, as William Kamkwamba did.
372.506	There's another great African that you've heard
374.586	that's busy disrupting the
374.586	automobile industry in the world.
378.318	He's also finding a way to reinvent solar power
381.077	and the electricity industry in North America,
383.848	and if he's lucky, he'll get us to Mars,
386.931	hopefully in my lifetime.
388.796	He comes from Pretoria, the capital of [South Africa],
391.879	about 50 kilometers from where I live.
394.815	So back to Joburg, which is sometimes called Egoli,
398.397	which means City of Gold.
400.546	And not only is mobile the gold of today,
404.557	I don't believe that the gold is under the ground.
406.927	I believe we are the gold.
408.659	Like you've heard the other economists say,
411.003	we are at the point where China was
413.035	when its boom years began,
415.468	and that's where we're going.
416.838	So, you hear the West talk
416.838	about innovation at the edge.
421.826	Well, of course it's happening at the edge,
423.735	because in the middle,
423.735	everybody's updating Facebook,
426.732	or worse still, they're trying to understand
428.731	Facebook's privacy settings.
430.858	(Laughter)
432.762	This is not that catchy catchphrase.
435.308	This is innovation over the edge.
439.21	So, people like to call Africa a mobile-first continent,
444.176	but actually it's mobile-only,
446.85	so while everybody else is doing all of those things,
450.495	we're solving the world's problems.
451.835	So there's only one thing left to say.
454.158	"[""You're welcome""] (Laughter)"
456.638	(Applause)
