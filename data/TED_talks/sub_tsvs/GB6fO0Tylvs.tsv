12.792	We're seen as the organization that is
12.792	the bucket for failed social policy.
16.485	I can't define who comes to us or how long they stay.
19.767	We get the people for whom
19.767	nothing else has worked,
21.903	people who have fallen through all
23.341	of the other social safety nets.
25.254	They can't contain them, so we must.
27.587	That's our job:
29.03	contain them, control them.
32.137	Over the years, as a prison system,
34.594	as a nation, and as a society,
36.415	we've become very good at that,
37.89	but that shouldn't make you happy.
40.01	Today we incarcerate more people per capita
41.71	than any other country in the world.
43.847	We have more black men in prison today
45.76	than were under slavery in 1850.
48.321	We house the parents of almost three million
50.081	of our community's children,
51.805	and we've become the new asylum,
53.825	the largest mental health provider in this nation.
56.862	When we lock someone up,
58.333	that is no small thing.
59.964	And yet, we are called the
59.964	Department of Corrections.
63.122	Today I want to talk about
64.51	changing the way we think about corrections.
66.605	I believe, and my experience tells me,
68.664	that when we change the way we think,
70.373	we create new possibilities, or futures,
73.207	and prisons need a different future.
75.833	I've spent my entire career
75.833	in corrections, over 30 years.
79.305	I followed my dad into this field.
80.785	He was a Vietnam veteran. Corrections suited him.
83.93	He was strong, steady, disciplined.
86.94	I was not so much any of those things,
88.38	and I'm sure that worried him about me.
90.779	Eventually I decided, if I was
90.779	going to end up in prison,
93.622	I'd better end up on the right side of the bars,
94.943	so I thought I'd check it out,
96.65	take a tour of the place my dad worked,
98.92	the McNeil Island Penitentiary.
101.101	Now this was the early '80s,
102.811	and prisons weren't quite what you see
104.338	on TV or in the movies.
106.32	In many ways, it was worse.
108.84	I walked into a cell house that was five tiers high.
111.454	There were eight men to a cell.
113.079	there were 550 men in that living unit.
115.427	And just in case you wondered,
117.31	they shared one toilet in those small confines.
120.376	An officer put a key in a lockbox,
121.879	and hundreds of men streamed out of their cells.
124.421	Hundreds of men streamed out of their cells.
126.4	I walked away as fast as I could.
128.763	Eventually I went back and
128.763	I started as an officer there.
131.361	My job was to run one of those cell blocks
133.158	and to control those hundreds of men.
136.319	When I went to work at our receptions center,
138.164	I could actually hear the inmates 
138.164	roiling from the parking lot,
140.89	shaking cell doors, yelling,
143.384	tearing up their cells.
145.058	Take hundreds of volatile people and lock them up,
147.422	and what you get is chaos.
149.186	Contain and control â€” that was our job.
151.959	One way we learned to do this more effectively
154.28	was a new type of housing unit
155.49	called the Intensive Management Unit, IMU,
158.193	"a modern version of a ""hole."""
160.016	We put inmates in cells behind solid steel doors
162.538	with cuff ports so we could restrain them
164.819	and feed them.
166.16	Guess what?
168.497	It got quieter.
169.991	Disturbances died down in the general population.
172.488	Places became safer
173.839	because those inmates who
173.839	were most violent or disruptive
176.439	could now be isolated.
177.864	But isolation isn't good.
179.595	Deprive people of social
179.595	contact and they deteriorate.
182.424	It was hard getting them out of IMU,
184.359	for them and for us.
186.912	Even in prison, it's no small thing
189.381	to lock someone up.
191.367	My next assignment was to one
191.367	of the state's deep-end prisons
193.921	where some of our more violent
193.921	or disruptive inmates are housed.
196.856	By then, the industry had advanced a lot,
198.7	and we had different tools and techniques
200.758	to manage disruptive behavior.
202.795	We had beanbag guns and pepper spray
205.02	and plexiglass shields,
206.91	flash bangs, emergency response teams.
209.345	We met violence with force
211.209	and chaos with chaos.
212.67	We were pretty good at putting out fires.
215.197	While I was there, I met two
215.197	experienced correctional workers
218.498	who were also researchers,
220.034	an anthropologist and a sociologist.
223.225	One day, one of them commented to me and said,
224.775	"""You know, you're pretty good at putting out fires."
226.813	"Have you ever thought about how to prevent them?"""
230.647	I was patient with them,
232.624	explaining our brute force approach
233.933	to making prisons safer.
235.79	They were patient with me.
237.324	Out of those conversations grew some new ideas
239.501	and we started some small experiments.
241.397	First, we started training our officers in teams
243.798	rather than sending them one or two
243.798	at a time to the state training academy.
247.04	Instead of four weeks of training, we gave them 10.
249.35	Then we experimented with an apprenticeship model
251.627	where we paired new staff with veteran staff.
255.2	They both got better at the work.
257.713	Second, we added verbal de-escalation skills
260.323	into the training continuum
262.213	and made it part of the use of force continuum.
264.95	It was the non-force use of force.
267.434	And then we did something even more radical.
269.036	We trained the inmates on those same skills.
271.346	We changed the skill set,
273.642	reducing violence, not just responding to it.
276.813	Third, when we expanded our facility, 
276.813	we tried a new type of design.
280.047	Now the biggest and most controversial component
282.752	of this design, of course, was the toilet.
286.429	There were no toilets.
288.118	Now that might not sound
288.118	significant to you here today,
290.749	but at the time, it was huge.
292.134	No one had ever heard of a cell without a toilet.
294.247	We all thought it was dangerous and crazy.
296.495	Even eight men to a cell had a toilet.
299.602	That small detail changed the way we worked.
302.459	Inmates and staff started interacting
304.189	more often and openly and developing a rapport.
307.463	It was easier to detect conflict and intervene
309.296	before it escalated.
310.61	The unit was cleaner, quieter,
310.61	safer and more humane.
314.246	This was more effective at keeping the peace
316.451	than any intimidation technique I'd seen to that point.
319.96	Interacting changes the way you behave,
321.388	both for the officer and the inmate.
323.494	We changed the environment
323.494	and we changed the behavior.
326.644	Now, just in case I hadn't learned this lesson,
328.537	they assigned me to headquarters next,
330.947	and that's where I ran straight
330.947	up against system change.
333.473	Now, many things work against system change:
336.042	politics and politicians, bills and laws,
338.151	courts and lawsuits, internal politics.
340.919	System change is difficult and slow,
342.989	and oftentimes it doesn't take you
344.531	where you want to go.
346.214	It's no small thing to change a prison system.
350.236	So what I did do is I reflected
350.236	on my earlier experiences
352.91	and I remembered that when we interacted
352.91	with offenders, the heat went down.
356.164	When we changed the environment,
356.164	the behavior changed.
358.155	And these were not huge system changes.
359.944	These were small changes, and these changes
361.699	created new possibilities.
363.91	So next, I got reassigned as
363.91	superintendent of a small prison.
366.617	And at the same time, I was working on my degree
368.876	at the Evergreen State College.
370.957	I interacted with a lot of
370.957	people who were not like me,
372.95	people who had different ideas
374.32	and came from different backgrounds.
376.026	One of them was a rainforest ecologist.
378.622	She looked at my small prison and what she saw
380.372	was a laboratory.
382.158	We talked and discovered how prisons and inmates
385.083	could actually help advance science
387.115	by helping them complete projects
388.744	they couldn't complete on their own,
390.555	like repopulating endangered species:
392.873	frogs, butterflies, endangered prairie plants.
396.02	At the same time, we found ways to make
397.347	our operation more efficient
398.93	through the addition of solar power,
401.153	rainwater catchment, organic gardening, recycling.
404.683	This initiative has led to many projects
407.182	that have had huge system-wide impact,
408.884	not just in our system, but in 
408.884	other state systems as well,
412.227	small experiments making a big difference
414.423	to science, to the community.
417.475	The way we think about our work changes our work.
420.642	The project just made my job
420.642	more interesting and exciting.
423.823	I was excited. Staff were excited.
425.78	Officers were excited. Inmates were excited.
427.79	They were inspired.
429.543	Everybody wanted to be part of this.
431.099	They were making a contribution, a difference,
433.418	one they thought was meaningful and important.
435.657	Let me be clear on what's going on here, though.
437.513	Inmates are highly adaptive.
439.256	They have to be.
440.928	Oftentimes, they know more about our own systems
443.689	than the people who run them.
445.67	And they're here for a reason.
447.321	I don't see my job as to punish them or forgive them,
450.607	but I do think they can have
451.87	decent and meaningful lives even in prison.
454.623	So that was the question:
456.2	Could inmates live decent and meaningful lives,
459.38	and if so, what difference would that make?
462.65	So I took that question back to the deep end,
465.547	where some of our most
465.547	violent offenders are housed.
468.212	Remember, IMUs are for punishment.
469.843	You don't get perks there, like programming.
471.907	That was how we thought.
473.837	But then we started to realize that if any inmates
475.95	needed programming, it
475.95	was these particular inmates.
478.237	In fact, they needed intensive programming.
480.423	So we changed our thinking 180 degrees,
482.761	and we started looking for new possibilities.
485.124	What we found was a new kind of chair.
487.662	Instead of using the chair for punishment,
489.608	we put it in classrooms.
491.278	Okay, we didn't forget our responsibility to control,
494.33	but now inmates could interact safely, face-to-face
496.559	with other inmates and staff,
498.205	and because control was no longer an issue,
499.84	everybody could focus on other things,
502.13	like learning. Behavior changed.
504.772	We changed our thinking, and we changed 
504.772	what was possible, and this gives me hope.
509.607	Now, I can't tell you that any of this stuff will work.
512.143	What I can tell you, though, it is working.
514.735	Our prisons are getting safer
514.735	for both staff and inmates,
518.164	and when our prisons are safe,
519.558	we can put our energies into
519.558	a lot more than just controlling.
523.013	Reducing recidivism may be our ultimate goal,
525.295	but it's not our only goal.
526.97	To be honest with you, preventing crime
528.726	takes so much more from so many more people
530.695	and institutions.
532.208	If we rely on just prisons to reduce crime,
535.476	I'm afraid we'll never get there.
537.434	But prisons can do some things
539.289	we never thought they could do.
540.965	Prisons can be the source of innovation
543	and sustainability,
544.381	repopulating endangered species
544.381	and environmental restoration.
547.74	Inmates can be scientists and beekeepers,
550.385	dog rescuers.
552.145	Prisons can be the source of meaningful work
554.678	and opportunity for staff
556.635	and the inmates who live there.
558.976	We can contain and control
561.15	and provide humane environments.
563.273	These are not opposing qualities.
565.864	We can't wait 10 to 20 years to find out
568.165	if this is worth doing.
569.752	Our strategy is not massive system change.
572.446	Our strategy is hundreds of small changes
574.25	that take place in days or months, not years.
577.935	We need more small pilots where we learn as we go,
581.332	pilots that change the range of possibility.
584.333	We need new and better ways to measure impacts
586.422	on engagement, on interaction,
588.163	on safe environments.
590.179	We need more opportunities to participate in
592.499	and contribute to our communities,
594.671	your communities.
597.12	Prisons need to be secure, yes, safe, yes.
600.164	We can do that.
601.147	Prisons need to provide humane environments
603.168	where people can participate, contribute,
605.235	and learn meaningful lives.
606.921	We're learning how to do that.
608.77	That's why I'm hopeful.
610.22	We don't have to stay stuck
610.22	in old ideas about prison.
612.511	We can define that. We can create that.
614.975	And when we do that thoughtfully and with humanity,
617.425	prisons can be more than the bucket
619.362	for failed social policy.
620.951	Maybe finally, we will earn our title:
624.301	a department of corrections.
626.296	Thank you.
628.396	(Applause)
