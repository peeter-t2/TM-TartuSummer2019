11.843	[This talk contains graphic language
11.843	and descriptions of sexual violence
15.308	Viewer discretion is advised]
16.713	Tom Stranger: In 1996,
16.713	when I was 18 years old,
19.693	I had the golden opportunity to go
19.693	on an international exchange program.
23.891	Ironically I'm an Australian
23.891	who prefers proper icy cold weather,
27.636	so I was both excited and tearful
27.636	when I got on a plane to Iceland,
32.519	after just having farewelled
32.519	my parents and brothers goodbye.
36.673	I was welcomed into the home
36.673	of a beautiful Icelandic family
39.752	who took me hiking,
41.177	and helped me get a grasp
41.177	of the melodic Icelandic language.
45.033	I struggled a bit with the initial
45.033	period of homesickness.
48.045	I snowboarded after school,
50.067	and I slept a lot.
52.3	Two hours of chemistry class in a language
52.3	that you don't yet fully understand
56.262	can be a pretty good sedative.
58.068	(Laughter)
60.456	My teacher recommended
60.456	I try out for the school play,
63.004	just to get me a bit more socially active.
65.914	It turns out I didn't end up
65.914	being part of the play,
68.439	but through it I met Thordis.
71.271	We shared a lovely teenage romance,
73.358	and we'd meet at lunchtimes
73.358	to just hold hands
75.876	and walk around old downtown Reykjavík.
78.475	I met her welcoming family,
78.475	and she met my friends.
82.495	We'd been in a budding relationship
82.495	for a bit over a month
85.293	when our school's Christmas Ball was held.
89.872	Thordis Elva: I was 16
89.872	and in love for the first time.
93.617	Going together to the Christmas dance
95.438	was a public confirmation
95.438	of our relationship,
98.259	and I felt like the luckiest
98.259	girl in the world.
101.25	No longer a child, but a young woman.
104.55	High on my newfound maturity,
106.487	I felt it was only natural to try drinking
106.487	rum for the first time that night, too.
111.316	That was a bad idea.
113.402	I became very ill,
114.914	drifting in and out of consciousness
116.758	in between spasms of convulsive vomiting.
119.907	The security guards wanted
119.907	to call me an ambulance,
122.895	but Tom acted as my knight
122.895	in shining armor,
125.908	and told them he'd take me home.
128.602	It was like a fairy tale,
130.327	his strong arms around me,
132.127	laying me in the safety of my bed.
135.422	But the gratitude that I felt
135.422	towards him soon turned to horror
139.973	as he proceeded to take off my clothes
139.973	and get on top of me.
145.277	My head had cleared up,
146.637	but my body was still
146.637	too weak to fight back,
149.788	and the pain was blinding.
152.585	I thought I'd be severed in two.
155.624	In order to stay sane,
157.223	I silently counted the seconds
157.223	on my alarm clock.
161.442	And ever since that night,
163.201	I've known that there are 7,200
163.201	seconds in two hours.
170.96	Despite limping for days
170.96	and crying for weeks,
174.222	this incident didn't fit my ideas
174.222	about rape like I'd seen on TV.
179.181	Tom wasn't an armed lunatic;
181.226	he was my boyfriend.
183.013	And it didn't happen in a seedy alleyway,
185.646	it happened in my own bed.
188.553	By the time I could identify
188.553	what had happened to me as rape,
192.196	he had completed his exchange program
194.211	and left for Australia.
196.352	So I told myself it was pointless
196.352	to address what had happened.
200.019	And besides,
201.228	it had to have been my fault, somehow.
204.505	I was raised in a world
204.505	where girls are taught
206.834	that they get raped for a reason.
209.604	Their skirt was too short,
212.193	their smile was too wide,
214.711	their breath smelled of alcohol.
217.837	And I was guilty of all of those things,
220.627	so the shame had to be mine.
223.495	It took me years to realize
224.943	that only one thing could have stopped me
224.943	from being raped that night,
228.878	and it wasn't my skirt,
231.044	it wasn't my smile,
233.018	it wasn't my childish trust.
235.652	The only thing that could've stopped me
235.652	from being raped that night
239.41	is the man who raped me --
241.484	had he stopped himself.
244.549	TS: I have vague memories of the next day:
247.536	the after effects of drinking,
249.874	a certain hollowness
249.874	that I tried to stifle.
253.451	Nothing more.
255.565	But I didn't show up at Thordis's door.
259.229	It is important to now state
261.059	that I didn't see my deed for what it was.
264.478	"The word ""rape"" didn't echo"
264.478	around my mind as it should've,
268.459	and I wasn't crucifying myself
268.459	with memories of the night before.
273.344	It wasn't so much a conscious refusal,
275.742	it was more like any acknowledgment
275.742	of reality was forbidden.
280.185	My definition of my actions completely
280.185	refuted any recognition
284.323	of the immense trauma I caused Thordis.
288.274	To be honest,
289.701	I repudiated the entire act
289.701	in the days afterwards
294.578	and when I was committing it.
297.263	I disavowed the truth by convincing
297.263	myself it was sex and not rape.
302.608	And this is a lie I've felt
302.608	spine-bending guilt for.
307.994	I broke up with Thordis
307.994	a couple of days later,
310.265	and then saw her a number of times
311.933	during the remainder
311.933	of my year in Iceland,
314.015	feeling a sharp stab
314.015	of heavyheartedness each time.
318.134	Deep down, I knew I'd done
318.134	something immeasurably wrong.
323.146	But without planning it,
323.146	I sunk the memories deep,
326.193	and then I tied a rock to them.
330.035	What followed is a nine-year period
331.805	that can best be titled
331.805	"as ""Denial and Running."""
335.83	When I got a chance to identify
335.83	the real torment that I caused,
340.333	I didn't stand still long enough to do so.
343.922	Whether it be via distraction,
346.003	substance use,
347.503	thrill-seeking
349.145	or the scrupulous policing
349.145	of my inner speak,
352.518	I refused to be static and silent.
356.747	And with this noise,
358.231	I also drew heavily
358.231	upon other parts of my life
361.224	to construct a picture of who I was.
364.456	I was a surfer,
365.71	a social science student,
367.451	a friend to good people,
369.561	a loved brother and son,
371.843	an outdoor recreation guide,
373.419	and eventually, a youth worker.
375.939	I gripped tight to the simple notion
375.939	that I wasn't a bad person.
381.28	I didn't think I had this in my bones.
383.949	I thought I was made up of something else.
386.428	In my nurtured upbringing,
388.012	my loving extended family and role models,
391.406	people close to me were warm and genuine
393.365	in their respect shown towards women.
396.537	It took me a long time to stare down
396.537	this dark corner of myself,
401.387	and to ask it questions.
406.051	TE: Nine years after the Christmas dance,
408.05	I was 25 years old,
409.555	and headed straight
409.555	for a nervous breakdown.
412.918	My self-worth was buried
412.918	under a soul-crushing load of silence
416.566	that isolated me from everyone
416.566	that I cared about,
419.882	and I was consumed
419.882	with misplaced hatred and anger
422.811	that I took out on myself.
425.455	One day, I stormed out
425.455	of the door in tears
428.089	after a fight with a loved one,
430.056	and I wandered into a café,
431.779	where I asked the waitress for a pen.
434.468	I always had a notebook with me,
436.338	claiming that it was to jot down ideas
436.338	in moments of inspiration,
440.095	but the truth was that I needed
440.095	to be constantly fidgeting,
444.349	because in moments of stillness,
446.26	I found myself counting seconds again.
449.891	But that day, I watched in wonder
449.891	as the words streamed out of my pen,
454.924	forming the most pivotal letter
454.924	I've ever written,
458.009	addressed to Tom.
460.115	Along with an account of the violence
460.115	that he subjected me to,
463.679	"the words, ""I want to find forgiveness"""
466.886	stared back at me,
468.394	surprising nobody more than myself.
471.4	But deep down I realized that this
471.4	was my way out of my suffering,
476.11	because regardless of whether or not
476.11	he deserved my forgiveness,
480.171	I deserved peace.
483.167	My era of shame was over.
487.992	Before sending the letter,
489.515	I prepared myself for all kinds
489.515	of negative responses,
492.286	or what I found likeliest:
492.286	no response whatsoever.
497.036	The only outcome
497.036	that I didn't prepare myself for
499.807	was the one that I then got --
502.06	a typed confession from Tom,
502.06	full of disarming regret.
507.438	As it turns out, he, too,
507.438	had been imprisoned by silence.
512.174	And this marked the start
512.174	of an eight-year-long correspondence
516.248	that God knows was never easy,
518.696	but always honest.
521.537	I relieved myself of the burdens
521.537	that I'd wrongfully shouldered,
525.148	and he, in turn, wholeheartedly
525.148	owned up to what he'd done.
529.235	Our written exchanges became a platform
531.531	to dissect the consequences of that night,
534.272	and they were everything
534.272	from gut-wrenching
536.491	to healing beyond words.
539.433	And yet, it didn't bring about
539.433	closure for me.
544.178	Perhaps because the email format
544.178	didn't feel personal enough,
547.684	perhaps because it's easy to be brave
549.619	when you're hiding behind a computer
549.619	screen on the other side of the planet.
553.751	But we'd begun a dialogue
555.561	that I felt was necessary
555.561	to explore to its fullest.
559.892	So, after eight years of writing,
561.981	and nearly 16 years after that dire night,
565.711	I mustered the courage
565.711	to propose a wild idea:
569.566	that we'd meet up in person
571.25	and face our past once and for all.
576.991	TS: Iceland and Australia
576.991	are geographically like this.
581.07	In the middle of the two is South Africa.
583.866	We decided upon the city of Cape Town,
586.795	and there we met for one week.
590.246	The city itself proved to be
590.246	a stunningly powerful environment
593.74	to focus on reconciliation
593.74	and forgiveness.
597.667	Nowhere else has healing
597.667	and rapprochement been tested
600.33	like it has in South Africa.
602.856	As a nation, South Africa sought
602.856	to sit within the truth of its past,
606.747	and to listen to the details
606.747	of its history.
610.639	Knowing this only magnified the effect
610.639	that Cape Town had on us.
615.826	Over the course of this week,
617.312	we literally spoke
617.312	our life stories to each other,
620.226	from start to finish.
623.125	And this was about analyzing
623.125	our own history.
627.388	We followed a strict policy
627.388	of being honest,
630.245	and this also came
630.245	with a certain exposure,
633.194	an open-chested vulnerability.
636.132	There were gutting confessions,
638.283	and moments where we just
638.283	absolutely couldn't fathom
641.131	the other person's experience.
644.078	The seismic effects of sexual violence
644.078	were spoken aloud and felt,
648.996	face to face.
651.799	At other times, though,
653.326	we found a soaring clarity,
656.984	and even some totally unexpected
656.984	but liberating laughter.
663.07	When it came down to it,
664.624	we did out best to listen
664.624	to each other intently.
669.224	And our individual realities
669.224	were aired with an unfiltered purity
675.089	that couldn't do any less
675.089	than lighten the soul.
680.328	TE: Wanting to take revenge
680.328	is a very human emotion --
684.397	instinctual, even.
686.649	And all I wanted to do for years
688.684	was to hurt Tom back as deeply
688.684	as he had hurt me.
693.478	But had I not found a way
693.478	out of the hatred and anger,
696.555	I'm not sure I'd be standing here today.
699.878	That isn't to say that I didn't have
699.878	my doubts along the way.
704.509	When the plane bounced
704.509	on that landing strip in Cape Town,
708.194	I remember thinking,
709.821	"""Why did I not just get myself"
709.821	a therapist and a bottle of vodka
714.051	"like a normal person would do?"""
716.291	(Laughter)
719.235	At times, our search
719.235	for understanding in Cape Town
722.464	felt like an impossible quest,
724.655	and all I wanted to do was to give up
726.778	and go home to my loving
726.778	husband, Vidir,
729.018	and our son.
731.814	But despite our difficulties,
734.201	this journey did result
734.201	in a victorious feeling
738.853	that light had triumphed over darkness,
742.632	that something constructive
742.632	could be built out of the ruins.
748.392	I read somewhere
749.741	that you should try and be the person
749.741	that you needed when you were younger.
753.626	And back when I was a teenager,
755.234	I would have needed to know
755.234	that the shame wasn't mine,
759.106	that there's hope after rape,
761.644	that you can even find happiness,
763.263	like I share with my husband today.
765.681	Which is why I started writing feverishly
765.681	upon my return from Cape Town,
770.06	resulting in a book co-authored by Tom,
772.808	that we hope can be of use
772.808	to people from both ends
776.017	of the perpetrator-survivor scale.
779	If nothing else,
780.478	it's a story that we would've needed
780.478	to hear when we were younger.
786.546	Given the nature of our story,
788.391	I know the words
788.391	that inevitably accompany it --
791.753	victim, rapist --
794.333	and labels are a way to organize concepts,
796.612	but they can also be dehumanizing
796.612	in their connotations.
801.658	Once someone's been deemed a victim,
803.782	it's that much easier to file them away
803.782	as someone damaged,
809.039	dishonored,
810.569	less than.
812.463	And likewise, once someone
812.463	has been branded a rapist,
815.207	it's that much easier
815.207	to call him a monster --
818.396	inhuman.
820.434	But how will we understand
820.434	what it is in human societies
823.489	that produces violence
825.094	if we refuse to recognize
825.094	the humanity of those who commit it?
830.354	And how --
831.542	(Applause)
833.745	And how can we empower survivors
833.745	if we're making them feel less than?
839.892	How can we discuss solutions
839.892	to one of the biggest threats
843.343	to the lives of women and children
843.343	around the world,
846.641	if the very words we use
846.641	are part of the problem?
853.606	TS: From what I've now learnt,
856.122	my actions that night in 1996
856.122	were a self-centered taking.
861.848	I felt deserving of Thordis's body.
865.563	I've had primarily positive
865.563	social influences
868.452	and examples of equitable
868.452	behavior around me.
871.65	But on that occasion,
872.871	I chose to draw upon the negative ones.
875.536	The ones that see women
875.536	as having less intrinsic worth,
879.507	and of men having some unspoken
879.507	and symbolic claim to their bodies.
885.601	These influences I speak of
885.601	are external to me, though.
889.402	And it was only me in that room
889.402	making choices,
892.207	nobody else.
894.789	When you own something
896.598	and really square up to your culpability,
900.079	I do think a surprising thing can happen.
903.069	It's what I call a paradox of ownership.
906.809	I thought I'd buckle
906.809	under the weight of responsibility.
910.197	I thought my certificate
910.197	of humanity would be burnt.
914.296	Instead, I was offered
914.296	to really own what I did,
918.968	and found that it didn't possess
918.968	the entirety of who I am.
923.28	Put simply,
924.665	something you've done doesn't have
924.665	to constitute the sum of who you are.
930.479	The noise in my head abated.
932.771	The indulgent self-pity
932.771	was starved of oxygen,
936.823	and it was replaced
936.823	with the clean air of acceptance --
942.478	an acceptance that I did hurt
942.478	this wonderful person standing next to me;
946.786	an acceptance that I am part of a large
946.786	and shockingly everyday grouping of men
952.409	who have been sexually violent
952.409	toward their partners.
956.751	Don't underestimate the power of words.
960.192	Saying to Thordis that I raped her
960.192	changed my accord with myself,
964.857	as well as with her.
967.337	But most importantly,
968.833	the blame transferred from Thordis to me.
973.151	Far too often,
974.326	the responsibility is attributed
974.326	to female survivors of sexual violence,
978.934	and not to the males who enact it.
982.556	Far too often,
983.73	the denial and running leaves all parties
983.73	at a great distance from the truth.
990.804	There's definitely a public
990.804	conversation happening now,
994.191	and like a lot of people,
996.394	we're heartened
996.394	that there's less retreating
999.008	from this difficult
999.008	but important discussion.
1002.848	I feel a real responsibility
1002.848	to add our voices to it.
1009.892	TE: What we did is not a formula
1009.892	that we're prescribing for others.
1015.002	Nobody has the right to tell anyone else
1015.002	how to handle their deepest pain
1020.559	or their greatest error.
1023.156	Breaking your silence is never easy,
1025.531	and depending on where
1025.531	you are in the world,
1027.769	it can even be deadly
1027.769	to speak out about rape.
1031.908	I realize that even the most
1031.908	traumatic event of my life
1035.998	is still a testament to my privilege,
1038.781	because I can talk about it
1038.781	without getting ostracized,
1042.035	or even killed.
1044.113	But with that privilege of having a voice
1047.066	comes the responsibility of using it.
1050.553	That's the least I owe
1050.553	my fellow survivors who can't.
1056.661	The story we've just relayed is unique,
1059.751	and yet it is so common with sexual
1059.751	violence being a global pandemic.
1064.441	But it doesn't have to be that way.
1067.561	One of the things that I found useful
1067.561	on my own healing journey
1070.601	is educating myself about sexual violence.
1073.273	And as a result,
1073.273	I've been reading, writing
1075.711	and speaking about this issue
1075.711	for over a decade now,
1078.388	going to conferences around the world.
1080.964	And in my experience,
1082.967	the attendees of such events
1082.967	are almost exclusively women.
1088.833	But it's about time that we stop treating
1088.833	sexual violence as a women's issue.
1095.473	(Applause)
1108.889	A majority of sexual violence
1108.889	against women and men
1112.957	is perpetrated by men.
1114.864	And yet their voices are sorely
1114.864	underrepresented in this discussion.
1120.662	But all of us are needed here.
1125.564	Just imagine all the suffering
1125.564	we could alleviate
1129.473	if we dared to face this issue together.
1134.7	Thank you.
1135.882	(Applause)
