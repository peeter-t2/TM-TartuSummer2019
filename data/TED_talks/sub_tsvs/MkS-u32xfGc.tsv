16.26	I'm going to begin by reciting a poem.
20.26	"""Oh beloved dentist:"
22.26	Your rubber fingers in my mouth ...
25.26	your voice so soft and muffled ...
29.26	Lower the mask, dear dentist,
31.26	"lower the mask."""
34.26	(Laughter)
36.26	Okay, in this presentation,
38.26	I'm going to be putting the right side of your brains
40.26	through a fairly serious workout.
42.26	You're going to see a lot of imagery,
44.26	and it's not always connected to what I'm talking about,
47.26	so I need you to kind of split your brains in half
50.26	and let the images flow over one side
53.26	and listen to me on the other.
55.26	So I am one of those people
57.26	with a transformative personal story.
60.26	Six years ago,
62.26	after 20 years in graphic design and typography,
65.26	I changed the way I was working
67.26	and the way most graphic designers work
70.26	to pursue a more personal approach to my work,
75.26	with only the humble attempt
77.26	to simply make a living doing something that I loved.
81.26	But something weird happened.
84.26	I became bizarrely
86.26	popular.
88.26	My current work
90.26	seems to resonate with people
92.26	in a way that has so taken me by surprise
95.26	that I still frequently wonder
97.26	what in the hell is going on.
99.26	And I'm slowly coming to understand
101.26	that the appeal of what I do
103.26	may be connected to why I do it.
107.26	These days, I call myself a graphic artist.
111.26	So where my work as a graphic designer
114.26	was to follow strategy,
116.26	my work now
118.26	follows my heart
120.26	and my interests
122.26	with the guidance of my ego
125.26	to create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client.
129.26	Now, this is heresy
131.26	in the design world.
133.26	The ego is not supposed
135.26	to be involved in graphic design.
138.26	But I find that for myself,
140.26	without exception,
142.26	the more I deal with the work
144.26	as something of my own,
146.26	as something that is personal,
148.26	the more successful it is
150.26	as something that's compelling,
153.26	interesting and sustaining.
156.26	So I exist somewhat outside of the mainstream
158.26	of design thinking.
160.26	Where others might look at measurable results,
163.26	I tend to be interested in more ethereal qualities,
166.26	"like ""Does it bring joy?"""
168.26	"""Is there a sense of wonder?"""
170.26	"and ""Does it invoke curiosity?"""
173.26	This is a scientific diagram, by the way.
176.26	I don't have time to explain it,
178.26	but it has to do with DNA and RNA.
181.26	So I have a particular imaginative approach to visual work.
184.26	The things that interest me when I'm working
187.26	are visual structure,
189.26	surprise
191.26	and anything that requires figuring things out.
194.26	So for this reason, I'm particularly drawn
196.26	to systems and patterns.
199.26	I'm going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works.
202.26	This is a piece that I did for
204.26	The Guardian newspaper in the U.K.
206.26	They have a magazine that they call G2.
210.26	And this is for their puzzle special
212.26	in 2007.
214.26	And puzzling it is.
216.26	I started by creating a series of tiling units.
219.26	And these tiling units, I designed
221.26	specifically so that they would contain
223.26	parts of letterforms within their shapes
226.26	so that I could then
228.26	join those pieces together
230.26	to create letters and then words
232.26	within the abstract patterning.
235.26	But then as well, I was able to
237.26	just flip them, rotate them
239.26	and combine them in different ways
241.26	to create either regular patterns
243.26	or abstract patterns.
246.26	So here's the word puzzle again.
249.26	And here it is with the abstract surrounding.
252.26	And as you can see, it's extremely difficult to read.
256.26	But all I have to do is
258.26	fill certain areas of those letterforms
261.26	and I can bring those words out of
263.26	the background pattern.
265.26	But maybe that's a little too obvious.
267.26	So then I can add some color in with the background
270.26	and add a bit more color in with the words themselves,
273.26	and this way, working with the art director,
275.26	I'm able to bring it to just the right point
278.26	that it's puzzling for the audience --
281.26	they can figure out that there's something they have to read --
283.26	but it's not impossible for them to read.
288.26	I'm also interested in working with
290.26	unusual materials
292.26	and common materials in unusual ways.
295.26	So this requires figuring out how to
297.26	get the most out of something's innate properties
300.26	and also how to bend it to my will.
302.26	So ultimately,
304.26	my goal is to create something unexpected.
309.26	To this end, I have worked in sugar
311.26	for Stefan Sagmeister,
313.26	three-time TED speaker.
315.26	And this project began essentially
317.26	on my kitchen table.
319.26	I've been eating cereal for breakfast
321.26	all of my life.
323.26	And for that same amount of time,
325.26	I've been spilling sugar on the table
327.26	and just kind of playing with it with my fingers.
330.26	And eventually I used this technique
332.26	to create a piece of artwork.
334.26	And then I used it again to create
336.26	six pieces for Stefan's book,
338.26	"""Things in My Life I've Learned So Far."""
341.26	And these were created
343.26	without sketches, just freehand,
345.26	by putting the sugar down on a white surface
347.26	and then manipulating it to get
349.26	the words and designs out of it.
352.26	Recently, I've also made some
354.26	rather highbrow baroque borders
356.26	out of lowbrow pasta.
358.26	And this is for a chapter that I'm doing in a book,
361.26	and the chapter is on honor.
363.26	So it's a little bit unexpected,
365.26	but, in a way, it refers
367.26	to the macaroni art
369.26	that children make for their parents
371.26	or they make in school and give to their parents,
373.26	which is in itself a form of honor.
377.26	This is what you can do with some household tinfoil.
382.26	Okay, well, it's what I can do with some household tinfoil.
385.26	(Laughter)
391.26	I'm very interested in wonder,
394.26	in design as an impetus to inquiring.
398.26	To say I wonder is to say
400.26	I question, I ask.
402.26	And to experience wonder is to experience awe.
406.26	So I'm currently working on a book,
408.26	which plays with both senses of the word,
410.26	as I explore some of my own ideas
412.26	and inquiries
414.26	in a visual display of rather
416.26	peacock-like grandeur.
419.26	The world is full of wonder.
421.26	But the world of graphic design,
424.26	for the most part, is not.
426.26	So I'm using my own writings
428.26	as a kind of testing ground for a book that has
430.26	an interdependency between word and image
433.26	as a kind of seductive force.
436.26	I think that one of the things
438.26	that religions got right
440.26	was the use of visual wonder
442.26	to deliver a message.
444.26	I think this true marriage of art and information
447.26	is woefully underused in adult literature,
450.26	and I'm mystified as to
452.26	why visual wealth is not more commonly used
455.26	to enhance intellectual wealth.
458.26	When we look at works like this,
460.26	we tend to associate them with children's literature.
463.26	There's an implication that ornamental graphics
466.26	detract from the seriousness of the content.
469.26	But I really hope to have the opportunity
471.26	to change that perception.
474.26	This book is taking rather a long time,
478.26	but I'm nearly done.
481.26	For some reason, I thought it would be a good idea
483.26	to put an intermission
485.26	in my talk.
487.26	And this is it -- just to give you and me a moment to catch up.
490.26	(Laughter)
498.26	So I do these valentines.
501.26	I've been sending out valentines
503.26	on a fairly large scale since 2005.
506.26	These are my valentines
508.26	from 2005 and 2006.
510.26	And I started by
512.26	doing just a single image like this
514.26	and sending them out to each person.
516.26	But in 2007,
518.26	I got the cockamamie idea
520.26	to hand-draw each valentine
523.26	for everyone on my mailing list.
526.26	I reduced my mailing list to 150 people.
530.26	And I drew each person
532.26	their own unique valentine
535.26	and put their name on it
537.26	and numbered it and signed it and sent it out.
539.26	Believe it or not, I devised this
541.26	as a timesaving method.
545.26	I was very busy in the beginning of that year,
547.26	and I didn't know when I was going to find time
549.26	to design and print a single valentine.
552.26	And I thought that I could kind of do this piecemeal
554.26	as I was traveling.
557.26	It didn't exactly work out that way.
560.26	There's a longer story to this,
562.26	but I did get them all done in time,
565.26	and they were extremely well received.
568.26	I got an almost 100 percent response rate.
570.26	(Laughter)
572.26	And those who didn't respond
574.26	will never receive anything from me ever again.
576.26	(Laughter)
582.26	Last year,
584.26	I took a more conceptual approach to the valentine.
587.26	I had this idea that I wanted people
589.26	to receive a kind of
592.26	mysterious love letter,
594.26	like a found fragment in their mailbox.
597.26	I wanted it to be something
599.26	that was not addressed to them
601.26	or signed by me,
603.26	something that caused them to wonder
605.26	what on Earth this thing was.
608.26	And I specifically wrote
610.26	four pages that don't connect.
613.26	There were four different versions of this.
615.26	And I wrote them
617.26	so that they begin in the middle of a sentence,
619.26	end in the middle of a sentence.
621.26	And they're on the one hand, universal,
624.26	so I avoid specific names or places,
627.26	but on the other hand, they're personal.
629.26	So I wanted people to really get the sense that
632.26	they had received something that could have been
634.26	a love letter to them.
636.26	And I'm just going to read one of them to you.
639.26	"""You've never really been sure of this,"
642.26	but I can assure you that this quirk
644.26	you're so self-conscious of
646.26	is intensely endearing.
648.26	Just please accept that this piece of you
650.26	escapes with your smile,
652.26	and those of us who notice
654.26	are happy to catch it in passing.
656.26	Time spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds,
659.26	"but without the scratches and bird shit."""
661.26	(Laughter)
663.26	"""That is to say,"
665.26	your thoughts and words flit and dart,
667.26	disconcertedly elusive at times,
669.26	but when caught and examined --
671.26	ahh, such a wonder,
673.26	such a delightful reward.
675.26	There's no passing time with you,
677.26	only collecting --
679.26	the collecting of moments with the hope for preservation
681.26	and at the same time release.
684.26	Impossible? I don't think so.
686.26	I know this makes you embarrassed.
688.26	I'm certain I can see you blushing.
690.26	But I just have to tell you because
692.26	sometimes I hear your self-doubt,
694.26	and it's so crushing to think
696.26	that you may not know how truly wonderful you are,
698.26	how inspiring and delightful
701.26	"and really, truly the most completely ..."""
704.26	(Laughter)
706.26	(Applause)
712.26	So Valentine's Day
714.26	is coming up in a couple of days,
716.26	and these are currently arriving
718.26	in mailboxes all around the world.
721.26	This year, I got, what I really have to say
723.26	is a rather brilliant idea,
726.26	to laser cut
729.26	my valentines
731.26	out of used Christmas cards.
734.26	So I solicited friends
736.26	to send me their used Christmas cards,
739.26	and I made 500 of these.
742.26	Each one of them is completely different.
744.26	I'm just really, really thrilled with them.
746.26	I don't have that much else to say,
750.26	but they turned out really well.
755.26	I do spend a lot of time on my work.
758.26	And one of the things that I've been thinking about recently
761.26	is what is worth while.
763.26	What is it that's worth spending my time on
765.26	and my life on in this way?
768.26	Working in the commercial world,
770.26	this is something that I do have to struggle with at times.
774.26	And yes, sometimes I'm swayed by money.
777.26	But ultimately, I don't consider that a worthy goal.
780.26	What makes something worthwhile for me
783.26	is the people I work for or with,
786.26	the conditions I work under
788.26	and the audience that I'm able to reach.
791.26	"So I might ask: ""Who is it for?"""
793.26	"""What does it say?"""
795.26	"and ""What does it do?"""
798.26	You know, I have to tell you, it's really difficult
801.26	for someone like me to come up on stage
804.26	at this conference
806.26	with these unbelievably brilliant minds,
809.26	who are thinking these
811.26	really big-picture,
813.26	world-changing, life-changing
816.26	ideas and technologies.
821.26	And it's very, very common
824.26	for designers and people in the visual arts
827.26	to feel that we're
829.26	not contributing enough,
832.26	or worse, that all we're doing is
834.26	contributing to landfill.
836.26	Here I am; I'm showing you
838.26	some pretty visuals
840.26	and talking about aesthetics.
844.26	But I've come to believe that
846.26	truly imaginative visual work
849.26	is extremely important in society.
852.26	Just in the way that I'm inspired
854.26	by books
856.26	and magazines of all kinds,
858.26	conversations I have, movies,
861.26	so I also think,
863.26	when I put visual work out there into the mass media,
866.26	work that is interesting, unusual,
869.26	intriguing,
871.26	work that maybe opens up that sense
873.26	of inquiry in the mind,
876.26	that I'm seeding the imagination of the populace.
880.26	And you just never know who
882.26	is going to take something from that
884.26	and turn it into something else,
887.26	because inspiration
889.26	is cross-pollinating.
891.26	So a piece of mine
893.26	may inspire a playwright
895.26	or a novelist or a scientist,
898.26	and that in turn may be the seed
901.26	that inspires a doctor
903.26	or a philanthropist
905.26	or a babysitter.
907.26	And this isn't something that you can quantify
909.26	or track or measure,
912.26	and we tend to undervalue things in society
914.26	that we can't measure.
916.26	But I really believe
918.26	that a fully operating, rich society
921.26	needs these seeds coming from all directions
923.26	and all disciplines
925.26	in order to keep the gears of inspiration
928.26	and imagination
930.26	flowing and cycling and growing.
935.26	So that's why I do what I do,
938.26	and why I spend so much time and effort on it,
942.26	and why I work in the commercial, public sphere,
945.26	as opposed to the isolated, private sphere
948.26	of fine art:
950.26	because I want as many people as possible
953.26	to see my work, notice it, be drawn into it,
956.26	and be able to take something from it.
959.26	And I actually really feel that it's worthwhile
962.26	to spend my valuable
964.26	and limited time on this Earth
966.26	in this way.
968.26	And I thank you for allowing me to show it to you.
971.26	(Applause)
