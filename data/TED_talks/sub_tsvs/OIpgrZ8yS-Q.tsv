13.197	War has been a part of my life
13.197	since I can remember.
16.811	I was born in Afghanistan,
16.811	just six months after the Soviets invaded,
21.526	and even though I was too young
21.526	to understand what was happening,
24.831	I had a deep sense of the suffering
24.831	and the fear around me.
29.219	Those early experiences had a major impact
29.219	on how I now think about war and conflict.
35.049	I learned that when people
35.049	have a fundamental issue at stake,
38.511	for most of them,
39.787	giving in is not an option.
41.971	For these types conflicts --
43.607	when people's rights are violated,
45.416	when their countries are occupied,
47.21	when they're oppressed and humiliated --
49.452	they need a powerful way
49.452	to resist and to fight back.
53.308	Which means that no matter how destructive
53.308	and terrible violence is,
57.595	if people see it as their only choice,
60.043	they will use it.
62.074	Most of us are concerned
62.074	with the level of violence in the world.
66.045	But we're not going to end war
67.523	by telling people
67.523	that violence is morally wrong.
70.883	Instead, we must offer them a tool
73.306	that's at least as powerful
73.306	and as effective as violence.
77.574	This is the work I do.
79.717	For the past 13 years,
81.28	I've been teaching people
82.589	in some of the most difficult
82.589	situations around the world
85.721	how they can use nonviolent
85.721	struggle to conduct conflict.
90.113	Most people associate this type of action
90.113	with Gandhi and Martin Luther King.
95.589	But people have been using
95.589	nonviolent action for thousands of years.
99.831	In fact, most of the rights
99.831	that we have today in this country --
104.187	as women,
105.362	as minorities,
106.537	as workers,
107.909	as people of different sexual orientations
110.499	and citizens concerned
110.499	with the environment --
112.981	these rights weren't handed to us.
115.226	They were won by people
115.226	who fought for them
117.41	and who sacrificed for them.
119.256	But because we haven't learned
119.256	from this history,
121.8	nonviolent struggle as a technique
121.8	is widely misunderstood.
126.488	I met recently with a group
126.488	of Ethiopian activists,
129.634	and they told me something
129.634	that I hear a lot.
132.808	They said they'd already
132.808	tried nonviolent action,
135.158	and it hadn't worked.
136.6	Years ago they held a protest.
138.96	The government arrested everyone,
138.96	and that was the end of that.
143.302	The idea that nonviolent struggle
143.302	is equivalent to street protests
147.286	is a real problem.
149.204	Because although protests can be a great
149.204	way to show that people want change,
153.628	on their own, they don't
153.628	actually create change --
156.522	at least change that is fundamental.
158.514	(Laughter)
159.726	Powerful opponents are not going to give
159.726	people what they want
162.859	just because they asked nicely ...
165.519	or even not so nicely.
167.42	(Laughter)
168.577	Nonviolent struggle works
168.577	by destroying an opponent,
172.018	not physically,
173.354	but by identifying the institutions
173.354	that an opponent needs to survive,
177.788	and then denying them
177.788	those sources of power.
180.47	Nonviolent activists
180.47	can neutralize the military
183.258	by causing soldiers to defect.
185.506	They can disrupt the economy
185.506	through strikes and boycotts.
189.19	And they can challenge
189.19	government propaganda
191.516	by creating alternative media.
193.829	There are a variety of methods
193.829	that can be used to do this.
197.384	My colleague and mentor, Gene Sharp,
200.2	has identified 198 methods
200.2	of nonviolent action.
206.186	And protest is only one.
208.376	Let me give you a recent example.
210.885	Until a few months ago,
212.378	Guatemala was ruled
212.378	by corrupt former military officials
215.619	with ties to organized crime.
218.071	People were generally aware of this,
219.888	but most of them felt powerless
219.888	to do anything about it --
224.401	until one group of citizens,
224.401	just 12 regular people,
228.506	put out a call on Facebook
228.506	to their friends
231.272	to meet in the central plaza,
231.272	holding signs with a message:
235.046	"""Renuncia YA"" --"
237.024	resign already.
239.199	To their surprise,
243.045	They stayed there for months
243.045	as protests spread throughout the country.
246.932	At one point,
248.112	the organizers delivered hundreds of eggs
248.112	to various government buildings
252.324	with a message:
253.96	"""If you don't have the huevos"" --"
255.87	the balls --
257.1	"""to stop corrupt candidates"
257.1	from running for office,
260.178	"you can borrow ours."""
261.66	(Laughter)
263.343	(Applause)
268.469	President Molina responded
270.012	by vowing that he would never step down.
272.674	And the activists realized
272.674	that they couldn't just keep protesting
276.299	and ask the president to resign.
278.337	They needed to leave him no choice.
280.793	So they organized a general strike,
282.748	in which people throughout
282.748	the country refused to work.
285.419	In Guatemala City alone,
286.845	over 400 businesses
286.845	and schools shut their doors.
290.367	Meanwhile,
291.572	farmers throughout the country
291.572	blocked major roads.
294.225	Within five days,
295.727	the president,
296.928	along with dozens of other
296.928	government officials,
299.675	resigned already.
301.168	(Applause)
305.475	I've been greatly inspired
307.102	by the creativity and bravery
307.102	of people using nonviolent action
311.029	in nearly every country in the world.
313.718	For example,
314.893	recently a group of activists in Uganda
317.474	released a crate of pigs in the streets.
320.096	You can see here that the police
320.096	are confused about what to do with them.
323.558	(Laughter)
324.618	The pigs were painted
324.618	the color of the ruling party.
327.617	One pig was even wearing a hat,
329.919	a hat that people recognized.
332.321	(Laughter)
334.264	Activists around the world
334.264	are getting better at grabbing headlines,
337.657	but these isolated actions do very little
340.344	if they're not part of a larger strategy.
342.914	A general wouldn't march
342.914	his troops into battle
345.177	unless he had a plan to win the war.
347.332	Yet this is how most of the world's
347.332	nonviolent movements operate.
350.896	Nonviolent struggle is just as complex
350.896	as military warfare,
355.24	if not more.
356.462	Its participants must be well-trained
356.462	and have clear objectives,
360.681	and its leaders must have a strategy
360.681	of how to achieve those objectives.
365.242	The technique of war has been developed
365.242	over thousands of years
368.532	with massive resources
370.103	and some of our best minds
370.103	dedicated to understanding
373.373	and improving how it works.
375.608	Meanwhile, nonviolent struggle
375.608	is rarely systematically studied,
380.214	and even though the number is growing,
382.248	there are still only a few dozen people
382.248	in the world who are teaching it.
386.849	This is dangerous,
388.166	because we now know that our old
388.166	approaches of dealing with conflict
392.358	are not adequate for the new
392.358	challenges that we're facing.
395.8	The US government recently admitted
397.907	that it's in a stalemate
397.907	in its war against ISIS.
401.318	But what most people don't know
403.086	is that people have stood up to ISIS
403.086	using nonviolent action.
407.12	When ISIS captured Mosul in June 2014,
410.954	they announced that they were putting
410.954	in place a new public school curriculum,
414.709	based on their own extremist ideology.
417.556	But on the first day of school,
419.672	not a single child showed up.
422.222	Parents simply refused to send them.
425.068	They told journalists they would rather
425.068	homeschool their children
428.284	than to have them brainwashed.
430.689	This is an example
430.689	of just one act of defiance
433.722	in just one city.
435.659	But what if it was coordinated
437.128	with the dozens of other acts
437.128	of nonviolent resistance
439.774	that have taken place against ISIS?
441.853	What if the parents' boycott
441.853	was part of a larger strategy
445.312	to identify and cut off the resources
445.312	that ISIS needs to function;
450.157	the skilled labor needed to produce food;
452.677	the engineers needed
452.677	to extract and refine oil;
456.29	the media infrastructure
456.29	and communications networks
458.907	and transportation systems,
460.904	and the local businesses
460.904	that ISIS relies on?
463.911	It may be difficult
463.911	to imagine defeating ISIS
467.056	with action that is nonviolent.
469.511	But it's time we challenge
469.511	the way we think about conflict
472.643	and the choices we have in facing it.
476.194	Here's an idea worth spreading:
478.489	let's learn more about where
478.489	nonviolent action has worked
481.668	and how we can make it more powerful,
484.209	just like we do with other
484.209	systems and technologies
487.277	that are constantly being refined
487.277	to better meet human needs.
491.446	It may be that we can improve
491.446	nonviolent action
494.929	to a point where it is increasingly
494.929	used in place of war.
498.838	Violence as a tool of conflict
498.838	could then be abandoned
502.937	in the same way that bows and arrows were,
505.368	because we have replaced them
505.368	with weapons that are more effective.
509.427	With human innovation, we can make
509.427	nonviolent struggle more powerful
514.33	than the newest and latest
514.33	technologies of war.
518.01	The greatest hope for humanity
518.01	lies not in condemning violence
522.497	but in making violence obsolete.
526.365	Thank you.
527.54	(Applause)
