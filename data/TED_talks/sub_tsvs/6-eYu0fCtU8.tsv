12.84	I'm a painter.
14.12	I make large-scale figurative paintings,
16.72	which means I paint people
18.84	like this.
20.84	But I'm here tonight to tell you
20.84	about something personal
23.64	that changed my work and my perspective.
27.52	It's something we all go through,
29.24	and my hope is that my experience
29.24	may be helpful to somebody.
34.52	To give you some background on me,
34.52	I grew up the youngest of eight.
38.12	Yes, eight kids in my family.
40.32	I have six older brothers and a sister.
42.68	To give you a sense of what that's like,
45.72	when my family went on vacation,
47.76	we had a bus.
49.48	(Laughter)
52.92	My supermom would drive us all over town
55.68	to our various after-school activities --
58.44	not in the bus.
60.92	We had a regular car, too.
63.92	She would take me to art classes,
65.76	and not just one or two.
67.04	She took me to every available art class
67.04	from when I was eight to 16,
72.64	because that's all I wanted to do.
74.76	She even took a class with me
74.76	in New York City.
78.04	Now, being the youngest of eight,
78.04	I learned a few survival skills.
81.76	Rule number one:
83.32	don't let your big brother
83.32	see you do anything stupid.
87.6	So I learned to be quiet and neat
90.12	and careful to follow the rules
90.12	and stay in line.
93.52	But painting was where I made the rules.
96.64	That was my private world.
99.56	By 14, I knew I really wanted
99.56	to be an artist.
103.88	My big plan was to be a waitress
103.88	to support my painting.
108.44	So I continued honing my skills.
110.32	I went to graduate school
110.32	and I got an MFA,
112.48	and at my first solo show,
112.48	my brother asked me,
115.8	"""What do all these red dots"
115.8	"mean next to the paintings?"""
118.8	Nobody was more surprised than me.
121.56	The red dots meant
121.56	that the paintings were sold
124.04	and that I'd be able to pay my rent
126.16	with painting.
128.04	Now, my apartment
128.04	had four electrical outlets,
131.4	and I couldn't use a microwave
131.4	and a toaster at the same time,
134.72	but still, I could pay my rent.
137.48	So I was very happy.
140	Here's a painting
140	from back around that time.
143.4	I needed it to be
143.4	as realistic as possible.
145.56	It had to be specific and believable.
149.4	This was the place where I was
149.4	isolated and in total control.
155.68	Since then, I've made a career
155.68	of painting people in water.
159.4	Bathtubs and showers were
159.4	the perfect enclosed environment.
163.44	It was intimate and private,
165.2	and water was this complicated challenge
165.2	that kept me busy for a decade.
169.44	I made about 200 of these paintings,
172	some of them six to eight feet,
174.44	like this one.
176.24	For this painting, I mixed flour in
176.24	with the bathwater to make it cloudy
180.76	and I floated cooking oil on the surface
183.76	and stuck a girl in it,
185.12	and when I lit it up,
186.76	it was so beautiful
186.76	I couldn't wait to paint it.
190.08	I was driven by this
190.08	kind of impulsive curiosity,
194.56	always looking for something new to add:
196.52	vinyl, steam, glass.
199	I once put all this Vaseline
199	in my head and hair
202.8	just to see what that would look like.
205.2	Don't do that.
206.44	(Laughter)
210.12	So it was going well.
211.84	I was finding my way.
213.6	I was eager and motivated
215.8	and surrounded by artists,
217.88	always going to openings and events.
220.32	I was having some success and recognition
223.24	and I moved into an apartment
223.24	with more than four outlets.
228.28	My mom and I would stay up very late
230.16	talking about our latest ideas
230.16	and inspiring each other.
233.32	She made beautiful pottery.
236.96	I have a friend named Bo
236.96	who made this painting
239.44	of his wife and I dancing by the ocean,
241.84	"and he called it ""The Light Years."""
243.96	I asked him what that meant, and he said,
246.6	"""Well, that's when you've stepped"
246.6	into adulthood, you're no longer a child,
250.96	but you're not yet weighed down
250.96	"by the responsibilities of life."""
255	That was it. It was the light years.
258.56	On October 8, 2011,
260.56	the light years came to an end.
262.64	My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer.
267.16	It had spread to her bones,
267.16	and it was in her brain.
270.68	When she told me this, I fell to my knees.
272.959	I totally lost it.
275.72	And when I got myself together
275.72	and I looked at her,
278.16	I realized, this isn't about me.
279.76	This is about figuring out
279.76	how to help her.
283	My father is a doctor,
284.44	and so we had a great advantage
284.44	having him in charge,
288.04	and he did a beautiful job
288.04	taking care of her.
290.72	But I, too, wanted to do
290.72	everything I could to help,
293.52	so I wanted to try everything.
296.12	We all did.
297.72	I researched alternative medicines,
299.68	diets, juicing, acupuncture.
303.6	Finally, I asked her,
305	"""Is this what you want me to do?"""
307.28	"And she said, ""No."""
309.36	"She said, ""Pace yourself."
309.36	"I'm going to need you later."""
316.16	She knew what was happening,
317.92	and she knew what the doctors
319.36	and the experts
319.36	and the internet didn't know:
321.88	how she wanted to go through this.
324.6	I just needed to ask her.
327.84	I realized that if I tried to fix it,
329.96	I would miss it.
332.44	So I just started to be with her,
334.08	whatever that meant
334.08	and whatever situation came up,
337.4	just really listen to her.
340.32	If before I was resisting,
340.32	then now I was surrendering,
345.2	giving up trying to control
345.2	the uncontrollable
347.84	and just being there in it with her.
351.76	Time slowed down,
353.84	and the date was irrelevant.
357	We developed a routine.
359.44	Early each morning I would crawl
359.44	into bed with her and sleep with her.
363.16	My brother would come for breakfast
364.88	and we'd be so glad to hear
364.88	his car coming up the driveway.
367.68	So I'd help her up and take both her hands
371.2	and help her walk to the kitchen.
373.96	She had this huge mug she made
377.24	she loved to drink her coffee out of,
379.8	and she loved Irish soda bread
379.8	for breakfast.
383.6	Afterwards was the shower,
385	and she loved this part.
386.28	She loved the warm water,
387.84	so I made this as indulgent as I could,
391.32	like a spa.
393.36	My sister would help sometimes.
395.12	We had warm towels
397.44	and slippers ready immediately
399.6	so she never got cold for a second.
402.92	I'd blow-dry her hair.
405.2	My brothers would come in the evenings
405.2	and bring their kids,
408.08	and that was the highlight of her day.
411.08	Over time, we started to use a wheelchair,
414.08	and she didn't want to eat so much,
415.8	and she used the tiniest little teacup
415.8	we could find to drink her coffee.
423.12	I couldn't support her myself anymore,
425	so we hired an aide
425	to help me with the showers.
428.44	These simple daily activities
431.08	became our sacred ritual,
433.92	and we repeated them day after day
435.76	as the cancer grew.
437.56	It was humbling and painful
439.72	and exactly where I wanted to be.
444.16	"We called this time ""the beautiful awful."""
448.28	She died on October 26, 2012.
452	It was a year and three weeks
452	after her diagnosis.
456.76	She was gone.
461.52	My brothers, sister, and father and I
463.52	all came together in this
463.52	supportive and attentive way.
467.903	It was as though our whole family dynamic
469.88	and all our established roles vanished
471.96	and we were just
471.96	all together in this unknown,
474.64	feeling the same thing
476.52	and taking care of each other.
479.64	I'm so grateful for them.
485.16	As someone who spends most
485.16	of my time alone in a studio working,
488.8	I had no idea that this kind of connection
491.68	could be so important, so healing.
494.64	This was the most important thing.
498.12	It was what I always wanted.
501.16	So after the funeral, it was time
501.16	for me to go back to my studio.
507.6	So I packed up my car
507.6	and I drove back to Brooklyn,
510.44	and painting is what I've always done,
510.44	so that's what I did.
514.4	And here's what happened.
519.12	It's like a release of everything
519.12	that was unraveling in me.
525.919	That safe, very, very carefully
525.919	rendered safe place
530.919	that I created in all my other paintings,
533.88	it was a myth.
535.159	It didn't work.
537.28	And I was afraid, because
537.28	I didn't want to paint anymore.
543.12	So I went into the woods.
544.6	I thought, I'll try that, going outside.
548.24	I got my paints,
548.24	and I wasn't a landscape painter,
552.08	but I wasn't really
552.08	much of any kind of painter at all,
554.72	so I had no attachment, no expectation,
557.24	which allowed me to be reckless and free.
560.32	I actually left one of these wet paintings
562.4	outside overnight
565	next to a light in the woods.
568.2	By the morning it was lacquered with bugs.
572.52	But I didn't care.
572.52	It didn't matter. It didn't matter.
575.16	I took all these paintings
575.16	back to my studio,
577.56	and scraped them, and carved into them,
580.24	and poured paint thinner on them,
582.76	put more paint on top, drew on them.
585.08	I had no plan,
587.32	but I was watching what was happening.
590.68	This is the one with all the bugs in it.
593.96	I wasn't trying to represent a real space.
596.12	It was the chaos and the imperfections
596.12	that were fascinating me,
600.6	and something started to happen.
603.68	I got curious again.
606.32	This is another one from the woods.
610.32	There was a caveat now, though.
612.16	I couldn't be controlling
612.16	the paint like I used to.
615.12	It had to be about implying
615.12	and suggesting,
618.16	not explaining or describing.
621.76	And that imperfect,
621.76	chaotic, turbulent surface
626.04	is what told the story.
630.24	I started to be as curious
630.24	as I was when I was a student.
634	So the next thing was I wanted
634	to put figures in these paintings, people,
638.12	and I loved this new environment,
639.92	so I wanted to have
639.92	both people and this atmosphere.
645.76	When the idea hit me of how to do this,
647.92	I got kind of nauseous and dizzy,
650.72	which is really just adrenaline, probably,
653.6	but for me it's a really good sign.
656.56	And so now I want to show you
656.56	what I've been working on.
659.72	It's something I haven't shown yet,
659.72	and it's like a preview, I guess,
663.8	of my upcoming show,
665.08	what I have so far.
668.28	Expansive space
671	instead of the isolated bathtub.
673.48	I'm going outside instead of inside.
677.48	Loosening control,
679.88	savoring the imperfections,
681.92	allowing the --
684.16	allowing the imperfections.
687.68	And in that imperfection,
689.36	you can find a vulnerability.
691.28	I could feel my deepest intention,
691.28	what matters most to me,
698	that human connection
700.4	that can happen in a space
700.4	where there's no resisting or controlling.
705.56	I want to make paintings about that.
710.28	So here's what I learned.
713.24	We're all going to have
713.24	big losses in our lives,
717	maybe a job or a career,
719.08	relationships, love, our youth.
723.52	We're going to lose our health,
725.76	people we love.
728.24	These kinds of losses
728.24	are out of our control.
730.68	They're unpredictable,
732.72	and they bring us to our knees.
735.52	And so I say, let them.
738.84	Fall to your knees. Be humbled.
742.92	Let go of trying to change it
745.28	or even wanting it to be different.
747.44	It just is.
751.16	And then there's space,
752.64	and in that space feel your vulnerability,
755.84	what matters most to you,
757.56	your deepest intention.
760.64	And be curious to connect
763.6	to what and who is really here,
767.44	awake and alive.
770.12	It's what we all want.
772.8	Let's take the opportunity
772.8	to find something beautiful
776.72	in the unknown, in the unpredictable,
780.76	and even in the awful.
783.32	Thank you.
784.56	(Applause)
