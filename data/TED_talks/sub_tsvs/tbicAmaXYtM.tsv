13.8	Mia Birdsong: Why is Black Lives Matter
13.8	important for the US right now
18.4	and in the world?
20.56	Patrisse Cullors: Black Lives Matter
20.56	is our call to action.
24.44	It is a tool to reimagine a world
28.72	where black people are free to exist,
31.96	free to live.
33.92	It is a tool for our allies
33.92	to show up differently for us.
38.16	I grew up in a neighborhood
38.16	that was heavily policed.
42.48	I witnessed my brothers and my siblings
46.2	continuously stopped and frisked
46.2	by law enforcement.
49.96	I remember my home being raided.
52.52	And one of my questions
52.52	as a child was, why?
56.44	Why us?
58.36	Black Lives Matter
58.36	offers answers to the why.
63.6	It offers a new vision
63.6	for young black girls around the world
69.4	that we deserve to be fought for,
72.36	that we deserve to call
72.36	on local governments to show up for us.
79.36	Opal Tometi: And antiblack racism --
81.12	(Applause)
84.36	And antiblack racism is not only
84.36	happening in the United States.
88.4	It's actually happening
88.4	all across the globe.
91.16	And what we need now more than ever
91.16	is a human rights movement
95.32	that challenges systemic racism
95.32	in every single context.
100.2	(Applause)
104.24	We need this because the global reality
107.8	is that black people
107.8	are subject to all sorts of disparities
113.24	in most of our most challenging
113.24	issues of our day.
117.04	I think about issues like climate change,
119.84	and how six of the 10 worst impacted
119.84	nations by climate change
125.36	are actually on the continent of Africa.
129.08	People are reeling
129.08	from all sorts of unnatural disasters,
133.8	displacing them
133.8	from their ancestral homes
136.64	and leaving them without a chance
136.64	at making a decent living.
140.84	We also see disasters
140.84	like Hurricane Matthew,
144.92	which recently wreaked havoc
144.92	in many different nations,
148.48	but caused the most damage to Haiti.
151.8	Haiti is the poorest country
151.8	in this hemisphere,
156.04	and its inhabitants are black people.
159.88	And what we're seeing in Haiti
161.76	is that they were actually facing
161.76	a number of challenges
164.96	that even preceded this hurricane.
167.68	They were reeling from the earthquake,
169.56	they were reeling from cholera
169.56	that was brought in by UN peacekeepers
173.76	and still hasn't been eradicated.
176.56	This is unconscionable.
178.72	And this would not happen if this nation
178.72	didn't have a population that was black,
184.64	and we have to be real about that.
187.04	But what's most heartening right now
189.24	is that despite these challenges,
191.44	what we're seeing is
191.44	that there's a network of Africans
194.44	all across the continent
196.08	who are rising up and fighting back
196.08	and demanding climate justice.
200.28	(Applause)
203.84	MB: So Alicia,
205.08	you've said that when
205.08	black people are free,
207.88	everyone is free.
209.84	Can you talk about what that means?
211.56	Alicia Garza: Sure.
212.8	So I think race and racism
212.8	is probably the most studied
216.76	social, economic and political
216.76	phenomenon in this country,
220.68	but it's also the least understood.
223.84	The reality is that race
223.84	in the United States
226.64	operates on a spectrum
226.64	from black to white.
229.6	Doesn't mean that people who are
229.6	in between don't experience racism,
234	but it means that the closer
234	you are to white on that spectrum,
237.88	the better off you are.
239.2	And the closer to black
239.2	that you are on that spectrum
242.2	the worse off your are.
244.04	When we think about
244.04	how we address problems in this country,
247.88	we often start from a place
247.88	of trickle-down justice.
251.64	So using white folks
251.64	as the control we say,
254.48	well, if we make things
254.48	better for white folks
256.647	then everybody else is going to get free.
259.44	But actually it doesn't work that way.
261.32	We have to address problems at the root,
264	and when you deal with what's
264	happening in black communities,
268.16	it creates an effervescence, right?
270.519	So a bubble up rather than a trickle down.
273.36	Let me give an example.
275.12	When we talk about the wage gap,
276.72	we often say women make 78 cents
276.72	to every dollar that a man makes.
282.24	You all have heard that before.
284.12	But those are the statistics
284.12	for white women and white men.
287.36	The reality is that black women
287.36	make something like 64 cents
291.48	to every 78 cents that white women make.
294.96	When we talk about latinas,
294.96	it goes down to about 58 cents.
299.04	If we were to talk about indigenous women,
301.16	if we were to talk about trans women,
303	it would even go further down.
304.92	So again,
306.16	if you deal with those
306.16	who are the most impacted,
308.56	everybody has an opportunity
308.56	to benefit from that,
311.84	rather than dealing with the folks
311.84	who are not as impacted,
315.88	and expecting it to trickle down.
318.12	MB: So I love the effervescence,
319.72	bubbling up.
320.96	AG: Effervescence -- like champagne.
322.72	(Laughter)
323.96	MB: Who doesn't love
323.96	a glass of champagne, right?
326.32	Champagne and freedom, right?
327.76	(Laughter)
329.04	What more could we want, y'all?
331.32	So you all have been
331.32	doing this for a minute,
334.28	and the last few years have been --
337.68	well, I can't even imagine,
339.04	but I'm sure very transformative.
341.44	And I know that you all
341.44	have learned a lot about leadership.
345.48	What do you want
345.48	to share with these people
347.56	about what you've learned
347.56	about leadership?
349.64	Patrisse, let's start with you.
351.16	PC: Yeah, we have to invest
351.16	in black leadership.
353.76	That's what I've learned the most
353.76	in the last few years.
356.44	(Applause)
358.8	What we've seen is thousands
358.8	of black people showing up for our lives
364.8	with very little infrastructure
364.8	and very little support.
369.4	I think our work as movement leaders
369.4	isn't just about our own visibility
374.72	but rather how do we
374.72	make the whole visible.
379.36	How do we not just fight
379.36	for our individual selves
382.48	but fight for everybody?
384.32	And I also think
387.68	leadership looks like
387.68	everybody in this audience
392.96	showing up for black lives.
395.8	It's not just about coming
395.8	and watching people on a stage, right?
400.04	It's about how do you
400.04	become that leader --
402.064	whether it's in your workplace,
402.064	whether it's in your home --
406.2	and believe that the movement
406.2	for black lives isn't just for us,
410.28	but it's for everybody.
413.48	(Applause)
417	MB: What about you, Opal?
418.64	OT: So I've been learning
418.64	a great deal about interdependence.
422.44	I've been learning
422.44	about how to trust your team.
426.4	I've come up with this new mantra
428.04	after coming back
428.04	from a three-month sabbatical,
430.8	which is rare for black women to take
430.8	who are in leadership,
434.48	but I felt it was really important
434.48	for my leadership and for my team
438.88	to also practice stepping back
441.52	as well as also sometimes stepping in.
444.36	And what I learned in this process
444.36	was that we need to acknowledge
449.36	that different people
449.36	contribute different strengths,
453.08	and that in order
453.08	for our entire team to flourish,
456.6	we have to allow them
456.6	to share and allow them to shine.
460.76	And so during my sabbatical
462.48	with the organization
462.48	that I also work with,
465.08	I saw our team rise up in my absence.
468.32	They were able to launch new programs,
470.8	fundraise.
472.24	And when I came back,
473.96	I had to give them
473.96	a lot of gratitude and praise
478.04	because they showed me
478.04	that they truly had my back
481.8	and that they truly had their own backs.
484.72	You know, in this process
484.72	of my sabbatical,
487.36	I was really reminded
488.64	of this Southern African
488.64	philosophy of Ubuntu.
493.6	I am because you are;
496.72	you are because I am.
499.12	And I realized that my own leadership,
502.56	and the contributions
502.56	that I'm able to make,
505.12	is in large part due to the contributions
505.12	that they make, right?
509.4	And I have to acknowledge that,
509.4	and I have to see that,
512.04	and so my new mantra is,
512.04	"""Keep calm and trust the team."""
516.4	And also,
517.64	"""Keep calm and thank the team."""
520.08	MB: You know, one of the things
520.08	I feel like I've heard
522.68	in the context of the Black Lives Matter
522.68	movement more than anywhere else
526.48	is about being a leaderful movement,
528.72	and that's such a beautiful concept,
530.48	and I think that something
531.76	that women often bring
531.76	to the conversation about leadership
534.6	is really the collective piece.
536.12	What about you, Alicia?
538.04	AG: Yeah ...
540	How many of you heard that saying
540	that leadership is lonely?
545.4	I think that there is an element
545.4	where leadership is lonely,
548.32	but I also believe
548.32	that it doesn't have to be like that.
551.56	And in order for us to get to that point,
554.04	I think there's a few things
554.04	that we need to be doing.
556.8	So one is we have to stop
556.8	treating leaders like superheroes.
561.24	We are ordinary people
561.24	attempting to do extraordinary things,
566.6	and so we need to be
566.6	supported in that way.
569.68	The other thing that
569.68	I've learned about leadership
572.44	is that there's a difference
572.44	between leadership and celebrities, right?
578.64	And there's a way in which we've been
578.64	kind of transformed into celebrities
584	rather than people
584	who are trying to solve a problem.
587.84	And the way that we treat
587.84	celebrities is very fickle, right?
590.8	We like them one day,
592.08	we don't like what they're
592.08	wearing the next day,
594.36	and all of a sudden we have issues, right?
596.68	So we need to stop deifying leaders
599.08	so that more people
599.08	will step into leadership.
601.72	Lots of people are terrified
601.72	to step into leadership
604.36	because of how much scrutiny they receive
607.08	and how brutal we are with leaders.
610.2	And then the last thing
610.2	that I've learned about leadership
612.96	is that it's really easy to be a leader
612.96	when everybody likes you.
617.28	But it's hard to be a leader
617.28	when you have to make hard choices
621.96	and when you have to do what's right,
623.84	even though people
623.84	are not going to like you for it.
626.76	And so in that way,
628.04	I think another way
628.04	that we can support leaders
630.4	is to struggle with us,
633.12	but struggle with us politically,
634.76	not personally.
636.52	We can have disagreements
636.52	without being disagreeable,
640.44	but it's important for us
640.44	to sharpen each other,
643.64	so that we all can rise.
645.28	MB: That's beautiful, thank you.
646.853	(Applause)
651.72	So you all are doing work
654.6	that forces you to face
654.6	some brutal, painful realities
659.32	on a daily basis.
662.32	What gives you hope
663.8	and inspires you in that context?
667.32	PC: I am hopeful for black futures.
670.32	And I say that because
670.32	we live in a society
674.56	that's so obsessed with black death.
677.24	We have images of our death
677.24	on the TV screen,
681.84	on our Twitter timelines,
683.76	on our Facebook timelines,
686.32	but what if instead
686.32	we imagine black life?
690.32	We imagine black people
690.32	living and thriving.
693.72	And that --
695.2	that inspires me.
699.12	OT: What inspires me
699.12	these days are immigrants.
703.64	Immigrants all over the world
703.64	who are doing the best that they can
708.28	to make a living,
708.28	to survive and also to thrive.
712.76	Right now there are
712.76	over 244 million people
716.04	who aren't living
716.04	in their country of origin.
719.12	This is a 40 percent increase
719.12	since the year 2000.
723.44	So what this tells me
725.12	is that the disparities across the globe
725.12	are only getting worse.
730.36	Yet there are people who are finding
730.36	the strength and wherewithal to travel,
735.64	to move,
736.88	to eke out a better living for themselves
739.2	and to provide for their families
739.2	and their loved ones.
742.44	And some of these people
742.44	who are immigrants
745	are also undocumented.
747	They're unauthorized.
748.72	And they inspire me even more
750.88	because although our society
750.88	is telling them, you're not wanted,
754.64	you're not needed here,
756.04	and they're highly vulnerable
756.04	and subject to abuse, to wage theft,
760.44	to exploitation and xenophobic attacks,
763.72	many of them are also beginning
763.72	to organize in their communities.
767.92	And what I'm seeing is
767.92	that there's also an emerging network
772.12	of black, undocumented people
772.12	who are resisting the framework,
776.44	and resisting the criminalization
776.44	of their existence.
779.4	And that to me is incredibly powerful
782	and inspires me every singe day.
784.32	MB: Thank you.
786.68	Alicia?
789.12	AG: So we know that young people
789.12	are the present and the future,
793.16	but what inspires me are older people
796.6	who are becoming transformed
796.6	in the service of this movement.
801.32	We all know that as you get older,
803	you get a little more
803	entrenched in your ways.
805.2	It's happening to me, I know that's right.
808	But I'm so inspired when I see people
808	who have a way that they do things,
812.8	have a way that they
812.8	think about the world,
814.88	and they're courageous enough to be open
814.88	to listening to what the experiences are
820.32	of so many of us who want
820.32	to live in world that's just
823.76	and want to live
823.76	in a world that's equitable.
826.36	And I'm also inspired by the actions
826.36	that I'm seeing older people taking
831.04	in service of this movement.
832.6	I'm inspired by seeing older people
832.6	step into their own power and leadership
837.48	"and say, ""I'm not passing a torch,"
840.28	"I'm helping you light the fire."""
843.24	(Applause)
844.48	MB: I love that --
845.72	yes.
847.12	So in terms of action,
849.36	I think that it is awesome to sit here
849.36	and be able to listen to you all,
853.8	and to have our minds open and shift,
858.08	but that's not going to get
858.08	black people free.
861.08	So if you had one thing
861.08	you would like this audience
864.56	and the folks who are watching
864.56	around the world to actually do,
868.28	what would that be?
871.72	AG: OK, two quick ones.
875.12	One, call the White House.
877.04	The water protectors
877.04	are being forcibly removed
881.32	from the camp that they have set up
881.32	to defend what keeps us alive.
886.92	And that is intricately
886.92	related to black lives.
889.8	So definitely call the White House
889.8	and demand that they stop doing that.
893.88	There are tanks
895.12	and police officers arresting
895.12	every single person there as we speak.
900.28	(Applause)
902.88	The second thing that you can do
907	is to join something.
910.36	Be a part of something.
911.72	There are groups, collectives --
914.24	doesn't have to be a non-profit,
914.24	you know what I mean?
916.84	But there are groups that are doing
916.84	work in our communities right now
920.44	to make sure that black lives matter
920.44	so all lives matter.
924.48	Get involved;
925.72	don't sit on your couch and tell people
925.72	what you think they should be doing.
929.32	Go do it with us.
931.84	MB: Do you guys want to add anything?
934.32	That's good? All right. So --
936.2	And I think that the joining something,
938.32	like if you feel like there's
938.32	not something where you are, start it.
941.56	AG: Start it.
942.8	MB: These conversations that we're having,
944.88	have those conversations
944.88	with somebody else.
947	And then instead of just
947	letting it be a talk that you had,
949.84	actually decide to start something.
951.56	OT: That's right.
952.84	MB: I mean, that's what you all did.
954.579	You started something,
954.579	and look what's happened.
956.859	Thank you all so much
956.859	for being here with us today.
959.8	OT: Thank you.
961.04	(Applause)
