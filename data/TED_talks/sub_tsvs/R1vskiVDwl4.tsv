12.84	All right, I want to see a show of hands:
14.817	how many of you have
14.817	unfriended someone on Facebook
17.24	because they said something offensive
17.24	about politics or religion,
21.12	childcare, food?
23.28	(Laughter)
25.24	And how many of you
25.24	know at least one person that you avoid
28.079	because you just don't want
28.079	to talk to them?
30.88	(Laughter)
32.96	You know, it used to be that in order
32.96	to have a polite conversation,
36.2	we just had to follow the advice
36.2	"of Henry Higgins in ""My Fair Lady"":"
39.44	Stick to the weather and your health.
41.28	But these days, with climate change
41.28	and anti-vaxxing, those subjects --
44.68	(Laughter)
46	are not safe either.
47.32	So this world that we live in,
50.52	this world in which every conversation
53.12	has the potential
53.12	to devolve into an argument,
55.32	where our politicians
55.32	can't speak to one another
57.63	and where even the most trivial of issues
59.96	have someone fighting both passionately
59.96	for it and against it, it's not normal.
64.96	Pew Research did a study
64.96	of 10,000 American adults,
68.08	and they found that at this moment,
68.08	we are more polarized,
70.84	we are more divided,
72.16	than we ever have been in history.
74.96	We're less likely to compromise,
76.56	which means we're
76.56	not listening to each other.
78.76	And we make decisions about where to live,
81.32	who to marry and even
81.32	who our friends are going to be,
83.96	based on what we already believe.
86.08	Again, that means
86.08	we're not listening to each other.
89.08	A conversation requires a balance
89.08	between talking and listening,
92.44	and somewhere along the way,
92.44	we lost that balance.
95.12	Now, part of that is due to technology.
97.04	The smartphones that you all
97.04	either have in your hands
99.64	or close enough that you could
99.64	grab them really quickly.
102.32	According to Pew Research,
103.64	about a third of American teenagers
103.64	send more than a hundred texts a day.
108.56	And many of them, almost most of them,
108.56	are more likely to text their friends
113.16	than they are to talk
113.16	to them face to face.
116.16	There's this great piece in The Atlantic.
118.16	It was written by a high school teacher
118.16	named Paul Barnwell.
121.04	And he gave his kids
121.04	a communication project.
123.2	He wanted to teach them how to speak
123.2	on a specific subject without using notes.
126.96	"And he said this: ""I came to realize..."""
128.889	(Laughter)
132.2	"""I came to realize"
132.2	that conversational competence
135.4	might be the single
135.4	most overlooked skill we fail to teach.
139.52	Kids spend hours each day engaging
139.52	with ideas and each other through screens,
143.84	but rarely do they have an opportunity
145.72	to hone their interpersonal
145.72	communications skills.
148.32	It might sound like a funny question,
148.32	but we have to ask ourselves:
151.52	Is there any 21st-century skill
153.48	more important than being able to sustain
153.48	"coherent, confident conversation?"""
159.08	Now, I make my living talking to people:
161.32	Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers,
163.6	billionaires, kindergarten teachers,
166.04	heads of state, plumbers.
168.76	I talk to people that I like.
168.76	I talk to people that I don't like.
171.832	I talk to some people that I disagree with
171.832	deeply on a personal level.
175.64	But I still have
175.64	a great conversation with them.
178.44	So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes
178.44	or so teaching you how to talk
182.36	and how to listen.
184.8	Many of you have already heard
184.8	a lot of advice on this,
187.44	things like look the person in the eye,
189.44	think of interesting topics
189.44	to discuss in advance,
193.28	look, nod and smile to show
193.28	that you're paying attention,
198.08	repeat back what you just heard
198.08	or summarize it.
201	So I want you to forget all of that.
202.76	It is crap.
204	(Laughter)
207.04	There is no reason to learn
207.04	how to show you're paying attention
211.32	if you are in fact paying attention.
215	(Laughter)
216.88	(Applause)
219.8	Now, I actually use the exact
219.8	same skills as a professional interviewer
223.48	that I do in regular life.
226.44	So, I'm going to teach you
226.44	how to interview people,
229.92	and that's actually going to help you
229.92	learn how to be better conversationalists.
233.76	Learn to have a conversation
235.16	without wasting your time,
235.16	without getting bored,
237.52	and, please God,
237.52	without offending anybody.
240.84	We've all had really great conversations.
243.08	We've had them before.
243.08	We know what it's like.
245.28	The kind of conversation where you
245.28	walk away feeling engaged and inspired,
249	or where you feel
249	like you've made a real connection
251.48	or you've been perfectly understood.
253.6	There is no reason
254.84	why most of your interactions
254.84	can't be like that.
258.12	So I have 10 basic rules.
258.12	I'm going to walk you through all of them,
261.36	but honestly, if you just choose
261.36	one of them and master it,
265.12	you'll already enjoy better conversations.
267.88	Number one: Don't multitask.
270.12	And I don't mean
270.12	just set down your cell phone
272.32	or your tablet or your car keys
272.32	or whatever is in your hand.
275.2	I mean, be present.
277.12	Be in that moment.
279.4	Don't think about your argument
279.4	you had with your boss.
282.04	Don't think about what
282.04	you're going to have for dinner.
284.68	If you want to get out
284.68	of the conversation,
286.76	get out of the conversation,
288.16	but don't be half in it
288.16	and half out of it.
290.32	Number two: Don't pontificate.
292.92	If you want to state your opinion
295.12	without any opportunity for response
295.12	or argument or pushback or growth,
301.08	write a blog.
302.56	(Laughter)
305.64	Now, there's a really good reason
305.64	why I don't allow pundits on my show:
309.04	Because they're really boring.
310.84	If they're conservative, they're going to
310.84	hate Obama and food stamps and abortion.
314.722	If they're liberal, they're going to hate
316.72	big banks and oil corporations
316.72	and Dick Cheney.
318.96	Totally predictable.
320.24	And you don't want to be like that.
321.96	You need to enter every conversation
321.96	assuming that you have something to learn.
327.52	The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said
329.68	that true listening requires
329.68	a setting aside of oneself.
334.12	And sometimes that means
334.12	setting aside your personal opinion.
338.2	He said that sensing this acceptance,
341.52	the speaker will become
341.52	less and less vulnerable
343.8	and more and more likely
343.8	to open up the inner recesses
346.68	of his or her mind to the listener.
349.36	Again, assume that you have
349.36	something to learn.
352.88	"Bill Nye: ""Everyone you will ever meet"
352.88	"knows something that you don't."""
357.24	I put it this way:
358.6	Everybody is an expert in something.
363.16	Number three: Use open-ended questions.
366	In this case, take a cue from journalists.
368.08	Start your questions with who,
368.08	what, when, where, why or how.
371.2	If you put in a complicated question,
371.2	you're going to get a simple answer out.
374.92	"If I ask you, ""Were you terrified?"""
377.28	you're going to respond to the most
377.28	powerful word in that sentence,
380.48	"which is ""terrified,"" and the answer is"
380.48	"""Yes, I was"" or ""No, I wasn't."""
383.84	"""Were you angry?"" ""Yes, I was very angry."""
385.864	Let them describe it.
385.864	They're the ones that know.
388.96	Try asking them things like,
388.96	"""What was that like?"""
391.96	"""How did that feel?"""
393.44	Because then they might have to stop
393.44	for a moment and think about it,
397.76	and you're going to get
397.76	a much more interesting response.
400.76	Number four: Go with the flow.
403.72	That means thoughts
403.72	will come into your mind
406.56	and you need to let them
406.56	go out of your mind.
409.64	We've heard interviews often
411.64	in which a guest is talking
411.64	for several minutes
414.12	and then the host comes back in
414.12	and asks a question
416.56	which seems like it comes out of nowhere,
416.56	or it's already been answered.
420	That means the host probably
420	stopped listening two minutes ago
422.96	because he thought
422.96	of this really clever question,
426.4	and he was just bound
426.4	and determined to say that.
429.44	And we do the exact same thing.
431.44	We're sitting there having
431.44	a conversation with someone,
434.08	and then we remember that time
434.08	that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.
437.56	(Laughter)
438.92	And we stop listening.
440.56	Stories and ideas
440.56	are going to come to you.
442.64	You need to let them come and let them go.
446.08	Number five: If you don't know,
446.08	say that you don't know.
450.8	Now, people on the radio,
450.8	especially on NPR,
453.12	are much more aware
453.12	that they're going on the record,
456.08	and so they're more careful
456.08	about what they claim to be an expert in
459.68	and what they claim to know for sure.
461.84	Do that. Err on the side of caution.
464.24	Talk should not be cheap.
466.64	Number six: Don't equate
466.64	your experience with theirs.
471.28	If they're talking
471.28	about having lost a family member,
474.08	don't start talking about the time
474.08	you lost a family member.
476.96	If they're talking about the trouble
476.96	they're having at work,
479.84	don't tell them about
479.84	how much you hate your job.
482.2	It's not the same. It is never the same.
484.16	All experiences are individual.
485.96	And, more importantly,
485.96	it is not about you.
489.12	You don't need to take that moment
489.12	to prove how amazing you are
493.04	or how much you've suffered.
495.12	Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once
495.12	what his IQ was, and he said,
498.2	"""I have no idea. People who brag"
498.2	"about their IQs are losers."""
501.12	(Laughter)
503.08	Conversations are not
503.08	a promotional opportunity.
508.56	Number seven:
511.44	Try not to repeat yourself.
512.84	It's condescending,
512.84	and it's really boring,
515.24	and we tend to do it a lot.
516.92	Especially in work conversations
516.92	or in conversations with our kids,
520.88	we have a point to make,
522.16	so we just keep rephrasing it
522.16	over and over.
525.64	Don't do that.
526.88	Number eight: Stay out of the weeds.
529.2	Frankly, people don't care
532.039	about the years, the names,
534.679	the dates, all those details
536.64	that you're struggling
536.64	to come up with in your mind.
539.12	They don't care.
539.12	What they care about is you.
541.88	They care about what you're like,
544.08	what you have in common.
545.8	So forget the details. Leave them out.
548.88	Number nine:
550.12	This is not the last one,
550.12	but it is the most important one.
553.4	Listen.
554.96	I cannot tell you how many
554.96	really important people have said
558.4	that listening is perhaps the most,
558.4	the number one most important skill
562.32	that you could develop.
563.56	Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing,
565.48	"""If your mouth is open,"
565.48	"you're not learning."""
568.04	"And Calvin Coolidge said, ""No man"
568.04	"ever listened his way out of a job."""
572.68	(Laughter)
574.16	Why do we not listen to each other?
576.92	Number one, we'd rather talk.
579.48	When I'm talking, I'm in control.
581.32	I don't have to hear anything
581.32	I'm not interested in.
583.8	I'm the center of attention.
585.2	I can bolster my own identity.
587.12	But there's another reason:
588.52	We get distracted.
590	The average person talks
590	at about 225 word per minute,
593.56	but we can listen at up to
597.88	So our minds are filling in
597.88	those other 275 words.
601.88	And look, I know,
601.88	it takes effort and energy
605.08	to actually pay attention to someone,
607.4	but if you can't do that,
607.4	you're not in a conversation.
610.4	You're just two people shouting out
610.4	barely related sentences
613.28	in the same place.
614.56	(Laughter)
616.48	You have to listen to one another.
619	Stephen Covey said it very beautifully.
620.92	"He said, ""Most of us don't listen"
620.92	with the intent to understand.
624.88	"We listen with the intent to reply."""
628.96	One more rule, number 10,
628.96	and it's this one: Be brief.
632.84	[A good conversation is like a miniskirt;
632.84	short enough to retain interest,
636.36	but long enough to cover
636.36	the subject. -- My Sister]
638.8	(Laughter)
640.04	(Applause)
642.48	All of this boils down to the same
642.48	basic concept, and it is this one:
647.32	Be interested in other people.
650.2	You know, I grew up
650.2	with a very famous grandfather,
652.64	and there was kind of a ritual in my home.
654.72	People would come over
654.72	to talk to my grandparents,
657.2	and after they would leave,
657.2	my mother would come over to us,
660.08	"and she'd say, ""Do you know who that was?"
662.08	She was the runner-up to Miss America.
663.96	He was the mayor of Sacramento.
665.68	She won a Pulitzer Prize.
665.68	"He's a Russian ballet dancer."""
668.88	And I kind of grew up assuming
672.28	everyone has some hidden,
672.28	amazing thing about them.
675.68	And honestly, I think
675.68	it's what makes me a better host.
679.28	I keep my mouth shut
679.28	as often as I possibly can,
682.12	I keep my mind open,
683.56	and I'm always prepared to be amazed,
686.08	and I'm never disappointed.
688.76	You do the same thing.
690.64	Go out, talk to people,
693.08	listen to people,
694.32	and, most importantly,
694.32	be prepared to be amazed.
698.44	Thanks.
699.68	(Applause)
