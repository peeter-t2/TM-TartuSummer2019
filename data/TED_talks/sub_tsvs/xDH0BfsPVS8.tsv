12.036	I didn't know when I agreed to do this
16.605	whether I was expected to talk or to sing.
22.285	But when I was told that the topic was language,
27.333	I felt that I had to speak about something for a moment.
32.104	I have a problem.
36.453	It's not the worst thing in the world.
38.467	I'm fine.
39.664	I'm not on fire.
41.413	I know that other people in the world
43.314	have far worse things to deal with,
47.482	but for me, language and music are
53.432	inextricably linked through this one thing.
57.867	And the thing is that I have a stutter.
65.556	It might seem curious given that I spend
68.104	a lot of my life on the stage.
71.902	One would assume that I'm comfortable
74.926	in the public sphere and comfortable here,
77.358	speaking to you guys.
79.798	But the truth is that I've spent
79.798	my life up until this point
84.568	and including this point, living in mortal dread
88.919	of public speaking.
92.229	Public singing, whole different thing. (Laughter)
96.939	But we'll get to that in a moment.
100.432	I've never really talked about it before so explicitly.
106.342	I think that that's because I've always lived in hope
108.674	that when I was a grown-up,
111.218	I wouldn't have one.
117.49	I sort of lived with this idea that when I'm grown,
120.705	I'll have learned to speak French,
123.912	and when I'm grown, I'll learn
123.912	how to manage my money,
127.19	and when I'm grown, I won't have a stutter,
129.468	and then I'll be able to public speak
129.468	and maybe be the prime minister
131.791	and anything's possible and, you know.
135.156	(Laughter)
138.556	So I can talk about it now
141.605	because I've reached this point, where —
145.427	I mean, I'm 28.
149.367	I'm pretty sure that I'm grown now.
151.857	(Laughter)
153.679	And I'm an adult woman
155.681	who spends her life as a performer,
159.757	with a speech impediment.
162.659	So, I might as well come clean about it.
166.867	There are some interesting
166.867	angles to having a stutter.
170.849	For me, the worst thing that can happen
174.223	is meeting another stutterer.
177.485	(Laughter)
180.701	This happened to me in Hamburg, when
183.908	this guy, we met and he said,
185.911	"""Hello, m-m-m-my name is Joe,"""
189.532	"and I said, ""Oh, hello, m-m-m-my name is Meg."""
193.793	Imagine my horror when I realized
196.45	he thought I was making fun of him.
198.355	(Laughter)
204.197	People think I'm drunk all the time.
209.23	(Laughter)
212.63	People think that I've forgotten their name
216.306	when I hesitate before saying it.
220.997	And it is a very weird thing, because
223.22	proper nouns are the worst.
227.459	If I'm going to use the word
227.459	"""Wednesday"" in a sentence,"
231.249	and I'm coming up to the word,
234.152	and I can feel that I'm going to stutter or something,
237.121	"I can change the word to ""tomorrow,"""
240.431	"or ""the day after Tuesday,"""
242.49	or something else.
244.883	It's clunky, but you can get away with it,
249.866	because over time I've developed this
252.408	loophole method of using speech
256.795	where right at the last minute you
259.926	change the thing and you trick your brain.
264.207	But with people's names, you can't change them.
267.915	(Laughter)
270.593	When I was singing a lot of jazz,
273.762	I worked a lot with a pianist whose name was Steve.
279.285	As you can probably gather,
281.899	S's and T's, together or independently,
285.173	are my kryptonite.
289.287	But I would have to introduce the band
291.439	over this rolling vamp,
294.651	and when I got around to Steve,
297.5	"I'd often find myself stuck on the ""St."""
303.271	And it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable 
303.271	and it totally kills the vibe.
308.959	So after a few instances of this,
311.287	"Steve happily became ""Seve,"""
316.387	and we got through it that way. (Laughter)
321.887	I've had a lot of therapy,
324.238	and a common form of treatment is to use
326.525	this technique that's called smooth speech,
331.433	which is where you almost
331.433	sing everything that you say.
336.858	You kind of join everything together in this
339.21	very singsong, kindergarten teacher way,
343.475	and it makes you sound very serene,
343.475	like you've had lots of Valium,
347.454	and everything is calm. (Laughter)
351.246	That's not actually me.
354.373	And I do use that. I do.
357.698	I use it when I have to be on panel shows,
364.532	or when I have to do radio interviews,
367.911	when the economy of airtime is paramount.
372.774	(Laughter)
375.828	I get through it that way for my job.
380.216	But as an artist who feels that their work
382.933	is based solely on a platform of honesty
388.903	and being real,
392.937	that feels often like cheating.
396.671	Which is why before I sing, I wanted to tell you
399.885	what singing means to me.
403.544	It's more than making nice sounds,
407.595	and it's more than making nice songs.
412.997	It's more than feeling known, or understood.
418.531	It's more than making you feel the things that I feel.
424.696	It's not about mythology,
427.385	or mythologizing myself to you.
432.427	Somehow, through some miraculous
437.805	synaptic function of the human brain,
442.305	it's impossible to stutter when you sing.
447.761	And when I was younger,
447.761	that was a method of treatment
451.517	that worked very well for me,
453.97	singing, so I did it a lot.
459.85	And that's why I'm here today.
463.993	(Applause)
468.358	Thank you.
474.01	Singing for me is sweet relief.
478.583	It is the only time when I feel fluent.
487.43	It is the only time when what comes out of my mouth
490.856	is comprehensively exactly what I intended.
493.448	(Laughter)
495.731	So I know that this is a TED Talk,
498.668	but now i'm going to TED sing.
502.417	This is a song that I wrote last year.
503.976	Thank you very much. Thank you.
