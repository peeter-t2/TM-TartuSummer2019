16.21	Now, extinction is a different kind of death.
21.272	It's bigger.
23.895	We didn't really realize that until 1914,
26.975	when the last passenger pigeon, a female named Martha,
30.19	died at the Cincinnati zoo.
33.208	This had been the most abundant bird in the world
36.749	that'd been in North America for six million years.
40.356	Suddenly it wasn't here at all.
43.661	Flocks that were a mile wide and 400 miles long
47.738	used to darken the sun.
50.385	Aldo Leopold said this was a biological storm,
53.455	a feathered tempest.
56.26	And indeed it was a keystone species
58.704	that enriched the entire eastern deciduous forest,
62.72	from the Mississippi to the Atlantic,
65.004	from Canada down to the Gulf.
68.319	But it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades.
71.632	What happened?
72.832	Well, commercial hunting happened.
74.985	These birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton,
78.944	and it was easy to do because when those big flocks
81.264	came down to the ground, they were so dense
83.536	that hundreds of hunters and netters could show up
85.904	and slaughter them by the tens of thousands.
88.91	It was the cheapest source of protein in America.
91.928	By the end of the century, there was nothing left
93.903	but these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers.
98.743	There's an upside to the story.
100.618	This made people realize that the same thing
102.532	was about to happen to the American bison,
105.024	and so these birds saved the buffalos.
108.429	But a lot of other animals weren't saved.
110.103	The Carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere.
114.894	It was hunted to death for its feathers.
117.24	There was a bird that people liked on the East Coast called the heath hen.
120.342	It was loved. They tried to protect it. It died anyway.
123.351	"A local newspaper spelled out, ""There is no survivor,"
126.725	"there is no future, there is no life to be recreated in this form ever again."""
131.542	There's a sense of deep tragedy that goes with these things,
134.213	and it happened to lots of birds that people loved.
136.638	It happened to lots of mammals.
138.846	Another keystone species is a famous animal
141.469	called the European aurochs.
143.534	There was sort of a movie made about it recently.
145.989	And the aurochs was like the bison.
148.597	This was an animal that basically kept the forest
151.777	mixed with grasslands across the entire Europe and Asian continent,
156.829	from Spain to Korea.
159.173	The documentation of this animal goes back
161.301	to the Lascaux cave paintings.
164.526	The extinctions still go on.
166.718	There's an ibex in Spain called the bucardo.
169.747	It went extinct in 2000.
172.093	There was a marvelous animal, a marsupial wolf
174.85	called the thylacine in Tasmania, south of Australia,
178.581	called the Tasmanian tiger.
180.651	It was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos.
184.969	A little bit of film was shot.
198.853	Sorrow, anger, mourning.
204.11	Don't mourn. Organize.
207.266	What if you could find out that, using the DNA in museum specimens,
210.885	fossils maybe up to 200,000 years old
213.882	could be used to bring species back,
216.32	what would you do? Where would you start?
217.944	Well, you'd start by finding out if the biotech is really there.
220.858	I started with my wife, Ryan Phelan,
222.95	who ran a biotech business called DNA Direct,
226.084	and through her, one of her colleagues, George Church,
230.133	one of the leading genetic engineers
232.828	who turned out to be also obsessed with passenger pigeons
235.837	and a lot of confidence
237.448	that methodologies he was working on
239.76	might actually do the deed.
241.849	So he and Ryan organized and hosted a meeting
245.104	at the Wyss Institute in Harvard bringing together
247.368	specialists on passenger pigeons, conservation ornithologists, bioethicists,
251.979	and fortunately passenger pigeon DNA had already been sequenced
256.092	by a molecular biologist named Beth Shapiro.
259.383	All she needed from those specimens at the Smithsonian
262.262	was a little bit of toe pad tissue,
264.917	because down in there is what is called ancient DNA.
268.3	It's DNA which is pretty badly fragmented,
271.272	but with good techniques now, you can basically reassemble the whole genome.
276.164	Then the question is, can you reassemble,
278.485	with that genome, the whole bird?
280.98	George Church thinks you can.
283.484	"So in his book, ""Regenesis,"" which I recommend,"
286.549	he has a chapter on the science of bringing back extinct species,
290.012	and he has a machine called
291.548	the Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering machine.
294.996	It's kind of like an evolution machine.
296.73	You try combinations of genes that you write
299.436	at the cell level and then in organs on a chip,
302.676	and the ones that win, that you can then put
304.585	into a living organism. It'll work.
307.282	The precision of this, one of George's famous unreadable slides,
310.476	nevertheless points out that there's a level of precision here
315.075	right down to the individual base pair.
317.641	The passenger pigeon has 1.3 billion base pairs in its genome.
321.78	So what you're getting is the capability now
324.785	of replacing one gene with another variation of that gene.
328.31	It's called an allele.
330.213	Well that's what happens in normal hybridization anyway.
333.063	So this is a form of synthetic hybridization of the genome
336.254	of an extinct species
338.134	with the genome of its closest living relative.
341.664	Now along the way, George points out that
344.379	his technology, the technology of synthetic biology,
348.19	is currently accelerating at four times the rate of Moore's Law.
351.996	It's been doing that since 2005, and it's likely to continue.
356.284	Okay, the closest living relative of the passenger pigeon
358.988	is the band-tailed pigeon. They're abundant. There's some around here.
362.282	Genetically, the band-tailed pigeon already is
366.37	mostly living passenger pigeon.
368.738	There's just some bits that are band-tailed pigeon.
371.173	If you replace those bits with passenger pigeon bits,
373.917	you've got the extinct bird back, cooing at you.
378.132	Now, there's work to do.
380.04	You have to figure out exactly what genes matter.
382.754	So there's genes for the short tail in the band-tailed pigeon,
385.396	genes for the long tail in the passenger pigeon,
388.096	and so on with the red eye, peach-colored breast, flocking, and so on.
391.654	Add them all up and the result won't be perfect.
394.525	But it should be be perfect enough,
396.503	because nature doesn't do perfect either.
399.149	So this meeting in Boston led to three things.
403.325	First off, Ryan and I decided to create a nonprofit
406.871	called Revive and Restore that would push de-extinction generally
410.524	and try to have it go in a responsible way,
413.675	and we would push ahead with the passenger pigeon.
416.963	Another direct result was a young grad student named Ben Novak,
421.028	who had been obsessed with passenger pigeons since he was 14
424.284	and had also learned how to work with ancient DNA,
427.347	himself sequenced the passenger pigeon,
430.658	using money from his family and friends.
433.273	We hired him full-time.
435.42	Now, this photograph I took of him last year at the Smithsonian,
439.084	he's looking down at Martha,
441.315	the last passenger pigeon alive.
444.1	So if he's successful, she won't be the last.
446.835	The third result of the Boston meeting was the realization
449.717	that there are scientists all over the world
451.55	working on various forms of de-extinction,
453.524	but they'd never met each other.
455.339	And National Geographic got interested
457.323	because National Geographic has the theory that
459.806	the last century, discovery was basically finding things,
463.179	and in this century, discovery is basically making things.
467.256	De-extinction falls in that category.
469.08	So they hosted and funded this meeting. And 35 scientists,
472.914	they were conservation biologists and molecular biologists,
476.194	basically meeting to see if they had work to do together.
479.61	Some of these conservation biologists are pretty radical.
481.976	There's three of them who are not just re-creating ancient species,
485.538	they're recreating extinct ecosystems
488.659	in northern Siberia, in the Netherlands, and in Hawaii.
492.527	Henri, from the Netherlands,
494.802	with a Dutch last name I won't try to pronounce,
497.493	is working on the aurochs.
499.738	The aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle,
504.091	and so basically its genome is alive, it's just unevenly distributed.
509.665	So what they're doing is working with seven breeds
512.079	of primitive, hardy-looking cattle like that Maremmana primitivo on the top there
516.834	to rebuild, over time, with selective back-breeding,
520.299	the aurochs.
522.362	Now, re-wilding is moving faster in Korea
525.395	than it is in America,
527.254	and so the plan is, with these re-wilded areas all over Europe,
530.914	they will introduce the aurochs to do its old job,
534.122	its old ecological role,
536.064	of clearing the somewhat barren, closed-canopy forest
539.323	so that it has these biodiverse meadows in it.
543.134	Another amazing story
544.949	came from Alberto Fern√°ndez-Arias.
548.347	Alberto worked with the bucardo in Spain.
551.666	The last bucardo was a female named Celia
554.499	who was still alive, but then they captured her,
559.062	they got a little bit of tissue from her ear,
561.474	they cryopreserved it in liquid nitrogen,
564.658	released her back into the wild,
566.444	but a few months later, she was found dead under a fallen tree.
570.194	They took the DNA from that ear,
572.802	they planted it as a cloned egg in a goat,
576.242	the pregnancy came to term,
578.316	and a live baby bucardo was born.
580.531	It was the first de-extinction in history.
583.379	(Applause)
586.922	It was short-lived.
588.149	Sometimes interspecies clones have respiration problems.
591.787	This one had a malformed lung and died after 10 minutes,
594.828	but Alberto was confident that
597.908	cloning has moved along well since then,
600.308	and this will move ahead, and eventually
601.847	there will be a population of bucardos
603.854	back in the mountains in northern Spain.
607.111	Cryopreservation pioneer of great depth is Oliver Ryder.
610.937	At the San Diego zoo, his frozen zoo
613.324	has collected the tissues from over 1,000 species
617.275	over the last 35 years.
620.253	Now, when it's frozen that deep,
622.284	minus 196 degrees Celsius,
625.004	the cells are intact and the DNA is intact.
627.636	They're basically viable cells,
629.713	so someone like Bob Lanza at Advanced Cell Technology
633.341	took some of that tissue from an endangered animal
636.556	called the Javan banteng, put it in a cow,
638.75	the cow went to term, and what was born
641.8	was a live, healthy baby Javan banteng,
646.881	who thrived and is still alive.
650.284	The most exciting thing for Bob Lanza
653.06	is the ability now to take any kind of cell
655.748	with induced pluripotent stem cells
658.196	and turn it into germ cells, like sperm and eggs.
662.169	So now we go to Mike McGrew
664.452	who is a scientist at Roslin Institute in Scotland,
667.948	and Mike's doing miracles with birds.
670.252	So he'll take, say, falcon skin cells, fibroblast,
673.772	turn it into induced pluripotent stem cells.
676.56	Since it's so pluripotent, it can become germ plasm.
679.99	He then has a way to put the germ plasm
682.246	into the embryo of a chicken egg
685.79	so that that chicken will have, basically,
689.061	the gonads of a falcon.
690.902	You get a male and a female each of those,
692.816	and out of them comes falcons.
695.757	(Laughter)
697.716	Real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens.
702.841	Ben Novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting.
705.318	He showed how all of this can be put together.
707.747	The sequence of events: he'll put together the genomes
710.293	of the band-tailed pigeon and the passenger pigeon,
712.671	he'll take the techniques of George Church
715.621	and get passenger pigeon DNA,
717.902	the techniques of Robert Lanza and Michael McGrew,
720.587	get that DNA into chicken gonads,
722.846	and out of the chicken gonads get passenger pigeon eggs, squabs,
727.065	and now you're getting a population of passenger pigeons.
730.551	It does raise the question of,
732.495	they're not going to have passenger pigeon parents
734.468	to teach them how to be a passenger pigeon.
737.094	So what do you do about that?
739.35	Well birds are pretty hard-wired, as it happens,
742.023	so most of that is already in their DNA,
744.39	but to supplement it, part of Ben's idea
747.174	is to use homing pigeons
748.83	to help train the young passenger pigeons how to flock
752	and how to find their way to their old nesting grounds
754.734	and feeding grounds.
757.883	There were some conservationists,
759.521	really famous conservationists like Stanley Temple,
762.597	who is one of the founders of conservation biology,
765.213	and Kate Jones from the IUCN, which does the Red List.
769.869	They're excited about all this,
771.83	but they're also concerned that it might be competitive
774.333	with the extremely important efforts to protect
777.371	endangered species that are still alive,
779.581	that haven't gone extinct yet.
781.427	You see, you want to work on protecting the animals out there.
783.8	You want to work on getting the market for ivory in Asia down
788.029	so you're not using 25,000 elephants a year.
791.907	But at the same time, conservation biologists are realizing
794.957	that bad news bums people out.
797.541	And so the Red List is really important, keep track of
800.266	what's endangered and critically endangered, and so on.
803.59	But they're about to create what they call a Green List,
806.615	and the Green List will have species that are doing fine, thank you,
810.997	species that were endangered, like the bald eagle,
813.301	but they're much better off now, thanks to everybody's good work,
816.916	and protected areas around the world
819.082	that are very, very well managed.
820.843	So basically, they're learning how to build on good news.
824.946	And they see reviving extinct species
828.057	as the kind of good news you might be able to build on.
830.937	Here's a couple related examples.
834.262	Captive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species.
837.473	The California condor was down to 22 birds in 1987.
840.889	Everybody thought is was finished.
842.598	Thanks to captive breeding at the San Diego Zoo,
845.418	there's 405 of them now, 226 are out in the wild.
849.438	That technology will be used on de-extincted animals.
853.647	Another success story is the mountain gorilla in Central Africa.
857.114	In 1981, Dian Fossey was sure they were going extinct.
860.497	There were just 254 left.
862.53	Now there are 880. They're increasing in population
866.069	by three percent a year.
868.162	The secret is, they have an eco-tourism program,
871.553	which is absolutely brilliant.
873.222	So this photograph was taken last month by Ryan
875.857	with an iPhone.
878.633	That's how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors.
882.948	Another interesting project, though it's going to need some help,
886.683	is the northern white rhinoceros.
888.594	There's no breeding pairs left.
890.555	But this is the kind of thing that
892.725	a wide variety of DNA for this animal is available in the frozen zoo.
896.865	A bit of cloning, you can get them back.
899.66	So where do we go from here?
901.85	These have been private meetings so far.
903.514	I think it's time for the subject to go public.
906.171	What do people think about it?
907.638	You know, do you want extinct species back?
909.717	Do you want extinct species back?
912.569	(Applause)
917.835	Tinker Bell is going to come fluttering down.
920.331	It is a Tinker Bell moment,
921.545	because what are people excited about with this?
923.941	What are they concerned about?
925.992	We're also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon.
928.439	So Ben Novak, even as we speak, is joining the group
932.209	that Beth Shapiro has at UC Santa Cruz.
935.53	They're going to work on the genomes
936.918	of the passenger pigeon and the band-tailed pigeon.
939.205	As that data matures, they'll send it to George Church,
943.114	who will work his magic, get passenger pigeon DNA out of that.
947.009	We'll get help from Bob Lanza and Mike McGrew
949.853	to get that into germ plasm that can go into chickens
952.92	that can produce passenger pigeon squabs
955.488	that can be raised by band-tailed pigeon parents,
957.952	and then from then on, it's passenger pigeons all the way,
960.208	maybe for the next six million years.
963.344	You can do the same thing, as the costs come down,
965.659	for the Carolina parakeet, for the great auk,
968.881	for the heath hen, for the ivory-billed woodpecker,
971.676	for the Eskimo curlew, for the Caribbean monk seal,
973.782	for the woolly mammoth.
976.648	Because the fact is, humans have made a huge hole
979.124	in nature in the last 10,000 years.
982.214	We have the ability now,
984.253	and maybe the moral obligation, to repair some of the damage.
989.117	Most of that we'll do by expanding and protecting wildlands,
993.665	by expanding and protecting
995.334	the populations of endangered species.
999.861	But some species
1002.016	that we killed off totally
1007.199	we could consider bringing back
1010.513	to a world that misses them.
1013.68	Thank you.
1015.89	(Applause)
1027.088	Chris Anderson: Thank you.
1028.942	I've got a question.
1030.754	So, this is an emotional topic. Some people stand.
1035.504	I suspect there are some people out there sitting,
1038.36	kind of asking tormented questions, almost, about,
1041.369	well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute,
1043.279	there's something wrong with mankind
1046.376	interfering in nature in this way.
1049.856	There's going to be unintended consequences.
1053.328	You're going to uncork some sort of Pandora's box
1056.105	of who-knows-what. Do they have a point?
1060.091	Stewart Brand: Well, the earlier point is
1061.591	we interfered in a big way by making these animals go extinct,
1065.142	and many of them were keystone species,
1067.683	and we changed the whole ecosystem they were in
1070.192	by letting them go.
1071.985	Now, there's the shifting baseline problem, which is,
1074.566	so when these things come back,
1076.104	they might replace some birds that are there
1078.395	that people really know and love.
1080.789	I think that's, you know, part of how it'll work.
1083.536	This is a long, slow process --
1086.421	One of the things I like about it, it's multi-generation.
1088.655	We will get woolly mammoths back.
1090.712	CA: Well it feels like both the conversation
1092.488	and the potential here are pretty thrilling.
1094.776	Thank you so much for presenting. SB: Thank you.
1096.49	CA: Thank you. (Applause)
