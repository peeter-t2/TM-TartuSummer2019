12.396	What is love?
15.654	It's a hard term to define
17.961	in so far as it has a very wide application.
21.85	I can love jogging.
23.619	I can love a book, a movie.
25.645	I can love escalopes.
28.516	I can love my wife.
30.711	(Laughter)
35.776	But there's a great difference
38.81	between an escalope and my wife, for instance.
43.901	That is, if I value the escalope,
46.906	the escalope, on the other hand, 
46.906	it doesn't value me back.
53.019	Whereas my wife, she calls me
56.321	the star of her life.
58.122	(Laughter)
60.706	Therefore, only another desiring conscience
62.662	can conceive me as a desirable being.
65.894	I know this, that's why
67.474	love can be defined in a more accurate way
69.82	as the desire of being desired.
74.13	Hence the eternal problem of love:
76.925	how to become and remain desirable?
82.869	The individual used to find
86.489	an answer to this problem
88.722	by submitting his life to community rules.
91.727	You had a specific part to play
93.834	according to your sex, your age,
96.049	your social status,
97.925	and you only had to play your part
99.955	to be valued and loved by the whole community.
104.032	Think about the young woman
104.032	who must remain chaste before marriage.
107.789	Think about the youngest son 
107.789	who must obey the eldest son,
112.155	who in turn must obey the patriarch.
117.861	But a phenomenon
122.147	started in the 13th century,
125.51	mainly in the Renaissance, in the West,
129.512	that caused the biggest identity crisis
132.891	in the history of humankind.
135.088	This phenomenon is modernity.
137.358	We can basically summarize it
137.358	through a triple process.
140.306	First, a process of rationalization
140.306	of scientific research,
146.029	which has accelerated technical progress.
148.714	Next, a process of political democratization,
153.178	which has fostered individual rights.
156.292	And finally, a process of rationalization 
156.292	of economic production
160.85	and of trade liberalization.
163.735	These three intertwined processes
166.617	have completely annihilated
169.026	all the traditional bearings of Western societies,
173.332	with radical consequences for the individual.
175.957	Now individuals are free
178.518	to value or disvalue
181.922	any attitude, any choice, any object.
186.127	But as a result, they are themselves confronted
192.344	with this same freedom that others have
194.409	to value or disvalue them.
198.861	In other words, my value was once ensured
204.201	by submitting myself 
204.201	to the traditional authorities.
208.114	Now it is quoted in the stock exchange.
213.398	On the free market of individual desires,
218.048	I negotiate my value every day.
222.033	Hence the anxiety of contemporary man.
224.619	"He is obsessed: ""Am I desirable? How desirable?"
228.705	"How many people are going to love me?"""
231.803	And how does he respond to this anxiety?
234.509	Well, by hysterically collecting
234.509	symbols of desirability.
244.493	(Laughter)
247.46	I call this act of collecting,
249.765	along with others, seduction capital.
253.119	Indeed, our consumer society
255.162	is largely based on seduction capital.
260.631	It is said about this consumption
260.631	that our age is materialistic.
264.742	But it's not true! We only accumulate objects
268.69	in order to communicate with other minds.
271.501	We do it to make them love us, to seduce them.
276.918	Nothing could be less materialistic, 
276.918	or more sentimental,
280.638	than a teenager buying brand new jeans
284.863	and tearing them at the knees,
287.355	because he wants to please Jennifer.
289.467	(Laughter)
291.917	Consumerism is not materialism.
295.201	It is rather what is swallowed up
297.276	and sacrificed in the name of the god of love,
300.285	or rather in the name of seduction capital.
304.731	In light of this observation on contemporary love,
310.112	how can we think of love in the years to come?
313.427	We can envision two hypotheses:
315.711	The first one consists of betting
318.447	that this process of narcissistic 
318.447	capitalization will intensify.
324.141	It is hard to say what shape 
324.141	this intensification will take,
328.209	because it largely depends
329.94	on social and technical innovations,
332.708	which are by definition difficult to predict.
337.755	But we can, for instance,
339.657	imagine a dating website
343.381	which, a bit like those loyalty points programs,
347.513	uses seduction capital points
350.705	that vary according to my age, 
350.705	my height/weight ratio,
354.5	my degree, my salary,
357.023	or the number of clicks on my profile.
361.488	We can also imagine
365.374	a chemical treatment for breakups
368.747	that weakens the feelings of attachment.
372.565	By the way, there's a program on MTV already
376.622	in which seduction teachers
380.606	treat heartache as a disease.
384.524	"These teachers call themselves ""pick-up artists."""
388.226	"""Artist"" in French is easy, it means ""artiste."""
391.47	"""Pick-up"" is to pick someone up,"
394.182	but not just any picking up -- it's picking up chicks.
396.298	So they are artists of picking up chicks.
400.767	(Laughter)
402.224	"And they call heartache ""one-itis."""
407.339	"In English, ""itis"" is a suffix that signifies infection."
410.889	"One-itis can be translated as ""an infection from one."""
415.353	It's a bit disgusting. Indeed, for the pick-up artists,
419.122	falling in love with someone
422.571	is a waste of time,
424.403	it's squandering your seduction capital,
426.31	so it must be eliminated
428.102	like a disease, like an infection.
431.831	We can also envision
435.532	a romantic use of the genome.
438.549	Everyone would carry it around
442.199	and present it like a business card
445.399	to verify if seduction can progress to reproduction.
450.393	(Laughter)
454.021	Of course, this race for seduction,
459.184	like every fierce competition,
461.287	will create huge disparities 
461.287	in narcissistic satisfaction,
466.22	and therefore a lot of loneliness and frustration too.
470.27	So we can expect that modernity itself,
473.014	which is the origin of seduction capital,
473.014	would be called into question.
477.55	I'm thinking particularly of the reaction
480.181	of neo-fascist or religious communes.
485.11	But such a future doesn't have to be.
490.746	Another path to thinking about love may be possible.
496.168	But how?
498.258	How to renounce the hysterical need to be valued?
502.572	Well, by becoming aware
502.572	of my uselessness.
506.78	(Laughter)
508.879	Yes,
509.818	I'm useless.
512.109	But rest assured:
513.98	so are you.
515.442	(Laughter)
517.592	(Applause)
521.629	We are all useless.
525.999	This uselessness is easily demonstrated,
528.414	because in order to be valued
532.015	I need another to desire me,
535.026	which shows that I do not have any value of my own.
537.316	I don't have any inherent value.
542.764	We all pretend to have an idol;
545.489	we all pretend to be an idol for
545.489	someone else, but actually
548.408	we are all impostors, a bit like a man on the street
551.83	who appears totally cool and indifferent,
554.689	while he has actually anticipated and calculated
557.838	so that all eyes are on him.
561.443	I think that becoming aware
563.012	of this general imposture
565.219	that concerns all of us
566.627	would ease our love relationships.
568.447	It is because I want to be loved
570.837	from head to toe,
572.334	justified in my every choice,
574.309	that the seduction hysteria exists.
577.081	And therefore I want to seem perfect
579.374	so that another can love me.
580.994	I want them to be perfect
582.521	so that I can be reassured of my value.
584.678	It leads to couples
587.065	obsessed with performance
589.357	who will break up, just like that,
591.513	at the slightest underachievement.
594.067	In contrast to this attitude,
598.19	I call upon tenderness -- love as tenderness.
600.928	What is tenderness?
602.296	To be tender is to accept 
602.296	the loved one's weaknesses.
606.169	It's not about becoming a sad couple of orderlies.
609.826	(Laughter)
611.021	That's pretty bad.
613.091	On the contrary,
614.423	there's plenty of charm and happiness in tenderness.
617.189	I refer specifically to a kind of humor
617.189	that is unfortunately underused.
621.238	It is a sort of poetry of deliberate awkwardness.
624.115	I refer to self-mockery.
626.896	For a couple who is no longer sustained, supported
629.717	by the constraints of tradition,
631.794	I believe that self-mockery
633.342	is one of the best means for 
633.342	the relationship to endure.
