13.862	The world makes you something that you're not,
18.071	but you know inside what you are,
20.972	and that question burns in your heart:
23.852	How will you become that?
26.846	I may be somewhat unique in this,
29.212	but I am not alone,
31.241	not alone at all.
34.341	So when I became a fashion model,
36.461	I felt that I'd finally achieved the dream
38.161	that I'd always wanted since I was a young child.
41.417	My outside self finally matched my inner truth,
45.547	my inner self.
47.925	For complicated reasons which I'll get to later,
52.082	when I look at this picture,
55.03	at that time I felt like, Geena, you've done it,
57.574	you've made it,
58.913	you have arrived.
61.734	But this past October,
64.324	I realized that I'm only just beginning.
68.982	All of us are put in boxes by our family,
73.112	by our religion,
74.782	by our society,
76.726	our moment in history,
79.099	even our own bodies.
81.571	Some people have the courage to break free,
84.347	not to accept the limitations imposed by
86.786	the color of their skin
88.506	or by the beliefs of those that surround them.
92.293	Those people are always the threat
94.085	to the status quo,
95.309	to what is considered acceptable.
99.804	In my case, for the last nine years,
105.593	some of my neighbors,
107.287	some of my friends, colleagues, even my agent,
110.291	did not know about my history.
112.901	I think, in mystery, this is called the reveal.
116.657	Here is mine.
120.282	I was assigned boy at birth
123.095	based on the appearance of my genitalia.
126.177	I remember when I was five years old
128.095	in the Philippines walking around our house,
130.575	I would always wear this t-shirt on my head.
133.946	And my mom asked me,
135.441	"""How come you always wear"
135.441	"that t-shirt on your head?"""
138.021	"I said, ""Mom, this is my hair. I'm a girl."""
143.219	I knew then how to self-identify.
147.656	Gender has always been considered a fact,
152.363	immutable,
154.235	but we now know it's actually more fluid,
157.862	complex and mysterious.
161.877	Because of my success, I never had the courage
164.29	to share my story,
166.94	not because I thought what I am is wrong,
169.553	but because of how the world treats those of us
172.555	who wish to break free.
175.757	Every day,
177.495	I am so grateful because I am a woman.
181.431	I have a mom and dad and family
184.907	who accepted me for who I am.
187.752	Many are not so fortunate.
192.631	There's a long tradition in Asian culture
194.706	that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender.
198.284	There is a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
201.085	There is a Hindu goddess, hijra goddess.
205.351	So when I was eight years old,
207.7	I was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating
210.31	these mysteries.
212.428	I was in front of the stage,
214.866	and I remember, out comes this beautiful woman
217.977	right in front of me,
219.137	and I remember that moment something hit me:
221.423	That is the kind of woman I would like to be.
225.133	So when I was 15 years old,
227.693	still dressing as a boy,
229.11	I met this woman named T.L.
231.524	She is a transgender beauty pageant manager.
235.188	That night she asked me,
236.87	"""How come you are not joining the beauty pageant?"""
239.636	She convinced me that if I joined
241.852	that she would take care of the registration fee
245.175	and the garments,
246.787	and that night,
248.946	I won best in swimsuit
251.026	and best in long gown
252.54	and placed second runner up
254.189	among 40-plus candidates.
257.928	That moment changed my life.
260.554	All of a sudden, I was introduced
262.197	to the world of beauty pageants.
265.066	Not a lot of people could say that your first job
267.89	is a pageant queen for transgender women,
269.702	but I'll take it.
272.578	So from 15 to 17 years old, I joined
274.871	the most prestigious pageant
277.338	to the pageant where it's at
277.338	the back of the truck, literally,
281.879	or sometimes it would be a
281.879	pavement next to a rice field,
285.046	and when it rains --
286.967	it rains a lot in the Philippines --
289.714	the organizers would have to move it
291.022	inside someone's house.
295.097	I also experienced the goodness of strangers,
297.374	especially when we would travel
298.719	in remote provinces in the Philippines.
301.688	But most importantly, I met
303.179	some of my best friends in that community.
306.571	In 2001,
308.997	my mom, who had moved to San Francisco,
311.024	called me and told me that my
311.024	green card petition came through,
314.851	that I could now move to the United States.
318.134	I resisted it.
319.528	"I told my mom, ""Mom, I'm having fun."
321.597	I'm here with my friends,
322.507	"I love traveling, being a beauty pageant queen."""
326.041	But then two weeks later she called me, she said,
329.138	"""Did you know that if you move to the United States"
331.835	"you could change your name and gender marker?"""
335.068	That was all I needed to hear.
338.113	My mom also told me to put two E's
339.949	in the spelling of my name.
342.03	She also came with me when I had my surgery
344.413	in Thailand at 19 years old.
347.412	It's interesting, in some of the
347.412	most rural cities in Thailand,
350.94	they perform some of the most prestigious,
354.051	safe and sophisticated surgery.
358.44	At that time in the United States,
360.075	you needed to have surgery
361.543	before you could change your
361.543	name and gender marker.
364.858	So in 2001, I moved to San Francisco,
369.094	and I remember looking at
369.094	my California driver's license
373.523	with the name Geena
375.509	and gender marker F.
377.913	That was a powerful moment.
380.505	For some people,
382.367	their I.D. is their license to drive
384.294	or even to get a drink,
386.741	but for me, that was my license to live,
390.395	to feel dignified.
392.937	All of a sudden, my fears were minimized.
395.524	I felt that I could conquer my dream
397.881	and move to New York and be a model.
401.778	Many are not so fortunate.
405.085	I think of this woman named Islan Nettles.
408.536	She's from New York, she's a young woman
410.504	who was courageously living her truth,
413.024	but hatred ended her life.
416.077	For most of my community,
418.638	this is the reality in which we live.
421.57	Our suicide rate is nine times higher
424.058	than that of the general population.
426.994	Every November 20,
428.961	we have a global vigil
430.927	for Transgender Day of Remembrance.
434.077	I'm here at this stage
435.438	because it's a long history of people who fought
438.287	and stood up for injustice.
440.551	This is Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera.
446.533	Today, this very moment,
448.797	is my real coming out.
451.924	I could no longer live my truth
454.487	for and by myself.
457.318	I want to do my best to help others
459.483	live their truth without shame and terror.
464.236	I am here, exposed,
468.819	so that one day there will never be a need
471.261	for a November 20 vigil.
475.132	My deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am.
481.397	Will you?
483.182	Thank you very much.
485.156	(Applause)
488.113	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
494.368	Kathryn Schulz: Geena, one quick question for you.
496.376	I'm wondering what you would say,
498.213	especially to parents,
500.086	but in a more broad way, to friends,
502.043	to family, to anyone who finds themselves
504.607	encountering a child or a person
506.729	who is struggling with and uncomfortable with
508.289	a gender that's being assigned them,
510.178	what might you say
512.019	to the family members of that person
514.178	to help them become good and caring and kind
516.957	family members to them?
518.571	Geena Rocero: Sure. Well,
518.571	first, really, I'm so blessed.
520.623	The support system, with my mom especially,
523.724	and my family, that in itself
525.43	is just so powerful.
527.691	I remember every time I would coach
529.511	young trans women, I would mentor them,
532.063	and sometimes when they would call me
534.481	and tell me that their parents can't accept it,
536.984	I would pick up that phone call and tell my mom,
538.79	"""Mom, can you call this woman?"""
540.113	And sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, so â€”
543.614	But it's just, gender identity
547.128	is in the core of our being, right?
549.5	I mean, we're all assigned gender at birth,
553.142	so what I'm trying to do
555.017	is to have this conversation that
557.488	sometimes that gender assignment doesn't match,
560.897	and there should be a space
562.828	that would allow people to self-identify,
565.523	and that's a conversation that we should have
567.13	with parents, with colleagues.
570.222	The transgender movement,
571.597	it's at the very beginning,
574.222	to compare to how the gay movement started.
577.181	There's still a lot of work that needs to be done.
579.731	There should be an understanding.
581.336	There should be a space of curiosity
583.295	and asking questions,
585.869	and I hope all of you guys will be my allies.
588.512	KS: Thank you. That was so lovely.
588.512	GR: Thank you.
590.759	(Applause)
