25.095	I'm really excited to be here today.
26.898	I'll show you some stuff
26.898	that's just ready to come out of the lab,
30.024	literally, and I'm really glad
30.024	that you guys
32.824	are going to be among
32.824	the first to see it in person,
35.32	because I really think this is going
35.32	to really change
37.833	the way we interact
37.833	with machines from this point on.
40.339	Now, this is a rear-projected
40.339	drafting table.
43.038	It's about 36 inches wide
44.284	and it's equipped
44.284	with a multi-touch sensor.
46.391	Normal touch sensors that you see,
48.059	like on a kiosk
48.059	or interactive whiteboards,
50.22	can only register one point
50.22	of contact at a time.
53.137	This thing allows you to have
53.137	multiple points at the same time.
56.876	They can use both my hands;
56.876	I can use chording actions;
60.214	I can just go right up and use
60.214	all 10 fingers if I wanted to.
63.597	You know, like that.
64.778	Now, multi-touch sensing
64.778	isn't completely new.
69.345	People like Bill Buxton have been
69.345	playing around with it in the '80s.
72.622	However, the approach I built here
72.622	is actually high-resolution,
76.674	low-cost, and probably
76.674	most importantly, very scalable.
80	So, the technology, you know,
82.361	isn't the most exciting thing
82.361	here right now,
84.831	other than probably
84.831	its newfound accessibility.
87.173	What's really interesting here
87.173	is what you can do with it
90.722	and the kind of interfaces
90.722	you can build on top of it.
94.141	So let's see.
96.111	So, for instance, we have
96.111	a lava lamp application here.
100.448	Now, you can see,
102.174	I can use both of my hands to kind
102.174	of squeeze and put the blobs together.
105.627	I can inject heat into the system here,
108.194	or I can pull it apart
108.194	with two of my fingers.
110.4	It's completely intuitive;
110.4	there's no instruction manual.
113.154	The interface just kind of disappears.
115	This started out as a screensaver app
116.944	that one of the Ph.D. students
116.944	in our lab, Ilya Rosenberg, made.
120.015	But I think its true identity
120.015	comes out here.
125.153	Now what's great about a multi-touch
125.153	sensor is that, you know,
128.1	I could be doing this
128.1	with as many fingers here,
130.861	but of course multi-touch
130.861	also inherently means multi-user.
133.863	Chris could be interacting
133.863	with another part of Lava,
136.386	while I play around with it here.
138.044	You can imagine
138.044	a new kind of sculpting tool,
140.164	where I'm kind of warming something up,
140.164	making it malleable,
143.167	and then letting it cool down
143.167	and solidifying in a certain state.
150.712	Google should have
150.712	something like this in their lobby.
153.683	(Laughter)
159	I'll show you a little more
159	of a concrete example here,
162.296	as this thing loads.
164.181	This is a photographer's
164.181	light-box application.
166.922	Again, I can use both of my hands
166.922	to interact and move photos around.
170.923	But what's even cooler
170.923	is that if I have two fingers,
174.502	I can actually grab a photo and then
174.502	stretch it out like that really easily.
178.656	I can pan, zoom
178.656	and rotate it effortlessly.
182.146	I can do that grossly
182.146	with both of my hands,
184.501	or I can do it just with two fingers
184.501	on each of my hands together.
187.729	If I grab the canvas, I can do
187.729	the same thing -- stretch it out.
190.78	I can do it simultaneously,
190.78	holding this down,
192.963	and gripping on another one,
192.963	stretching this out.
195.286	Again, the interface just disappears here.
197.538	There's no manual.
198.595	This is exactly what you expect,
200.921	especially if you haven't interacted
200.921	with a computer before.
204	Now, when you have initiatives
204	like the $100 laptop,
206.728	I kind of cringe at the idea
208.285	of introducing a whole new
208.285	generation to computing
210.886	with this standard
210.886	mouse-and-windows-pointer interface.
213.648	This is something that I think
213.648	is really the way
216.808	we should be interacting
216.808	with machines from now on.
219.473	(Applause)
226	Now, of course, I can bring up a keyboard.
228.024	(Laughter)
233	And I can bring that around,
233	put that up there.
236.213	Obviously, this is a standard keyboard,
238.095	but of course I can rescale it
238.095	to make it work well for my hands.
241.201	That's really important, because
241.201	there's no reason in this day and age
244.558	that we should be conforming
244.558	to a physical device.
246.922	That leads to bad things, like RSI.
248.693	We have so much technology nowadays
251.494	that these interfaces
251.494	should start conforming to us.
255.547	There's so little applied now
255.547	to actually improving
259.548	the way we interact with interfaces
259.548	from this point on.
262.151	This keyboard is probably actually
262.151	the really wrong direction to go.
265.366	You can imagine, in the future,
265.366	as we develop this kind of technology,
268.692	a keyboard that kind of automatically
268.692	drifts as your hand moves away,
272.119	and really intelligently anticipates
272.119	which key you're trying to stroke.
276.477	So -- again, isn't this great?
280.051	(Laughter)
282.047	Audience: Where's your lab?
283.834	Jeff Han: I'm a research scientist
283.834	at NYU in New York.
290.341	Here's an example of another kind of app.
290.341	I can make these little fuzz balls.
294	It'll remember the strokes I'm making.
296.358	Of course I can do it with all my hands.
298.301	It's pressure-sensitive.
300.905	What's neat about that is,
302.485	I showed that two-finger gesture
302.485	that zooms in really quickly.
305.474	Because you don't have
305.474	to switch to a hand tool
307.705	or the magnifying glass tool,
309.135	you can just continuously make things
311.698	in real multiple scales,
311.698	all at the same time.
314.076	I can create big things out here,
316.113	but I can go back
316.113	and really quickly go back
318.235	to where I started,
318.235	and make even smaller things here.
322.271	This is going to be really important
324.182	as we start getting to things
324.182	like data visualization.
327.239	For instance, I think
327.239	we all enjoyed Hans Rosling's talk,
329.93	and he really emphasized the fact
329.93	I've been thinking about for a long time:
333.48	We have all this great data,
334.855	but for some reason,
334.855	it's just sitting there.
336.976	We're not accessing it.
338.119	And one of the reasons why I think that is
341.666	will be helped by things like graphics
341.666	and visualization and inference tools,
346.406	but I also think a big part of it
348.291	is going to be having better interfaces,
350.371	to be able to drill down
350.371	into this kind of data,
352.635	while still thinking
352.635	about the big picture here.
355.46	Let me show you another app here.
355.46	This is called WorldWind.
358.463	It's done by NASA.
359.626	We've all seen Google Earth;
362.48	this is an open-source version of that.
364.462	There are plug-ins to be able
364.462	to load in different data sets
368.01	that NASA's collected over the years.
369.833	As you can see, I can use
369.833	the same two-fingered gestures
372.477	to go down and go in really seamlessly.
374.983	There's no interface, again.
376.387	It really allows anybody
376.387	to kind of go in --
379.682	and it just does
379.682	what you'd expect, you know?
382.669	Again, there's just no interface here.
382.669	The interface just disappears.
388	I can switch to different data views.
389.9	That's what's neat about this app here.
392.118	NASA's really cool.
393.299	These hyper-spectral images
393.299	are false-colored so you can --
396.085	it's really good for determining
396.085	vegetative use.
400.887	Well, let's go back to this.
405.312	The great thing
405.312	about mapping applications --
407.51	it's not really 2D, it's 3D.
409.024	So, again, with a multi-point interface,
409.024	you can do a gesture like this --
412.54	so you can be able
412.54	to tilt around like that --
416.001	(Surprised laughter)
417.899	It's not just simply relegated
417.899	to a kind of 2D panning and motion.
421.105	This gesture is just putting
421.105	two fingers down --
423.764	it's defining an axis of tilt --
423.764	and I can tilt up and down that way.
427.441	We just came up with that on the spot,
429.543	it's probably not the right thing to do,
431.504	but there's such interesting things
431.504	you can do with this interface.
436	It's just so much fun
436	playing around with it, too.
438.958	(Laughter)
440.335	And so the last thing
440.335	I want to show you is --
443	I'm sure we can all think
443	of a lot of entertainment apps
445.701	that you can do with this thing.
447.249	I'm more interested in the creative
447.249	applications we can do with this.
451.323	Now, here's a simple application here --
451.323	I can draw out a curve.
456.201	And when I close it,
456.201	it becomes a character.
459.785	But the neat thing about it
459.785	is I can add control points.
462.786	And then what I can do is manipulate them
462.786	with both of my fingers at the same time.
466.787	And you notice what it does.
469.253	It's kind of a puppeteering thing,
471.832	where I can use as many fingers
471.832	as I have to draw and make --
483.274	Now, there's a lot of actual math
483.274	going on under here
486	for this to control this mesh
486	and do the right thing.
491.183	This technique of being able to manipulate
491.183	a mesh here, with multiple control points,
496.899	is actually state of the art.
498.399	It was released at SIGGRAPH last year.
500.247	It's a great example
500.247	of the kind of research I really love:
503.041	all this compute power
503.041	to make things do the right things,
505.864	intuitive things,
505.864	to do exactly what you expect.
512	So, multi-touch interaction research
512	is a very active field right now in HCI.
517	I'm not the only one doing it,
517	a lot of other people are getting into it.
520.5	This kind of technology is going to let
520.5	even more people get into it,
523.769	I'm looking forward to interacting
523.769	with all of you over the next few days
527.285	and seeing how it can apply
527.285	to your respective fields.
529.846	Thank you.
531.028	(Applause)
