12.155	My name is Tom,
13.918	and I've come here today to come clean
17.094	about what I do for money.
20.551	Basically, I use my mouth in strange ways
24.051	in exchange for cash.
26.241	(Laughter)
27.336	I usually do this kind of thing
27.336	in seedy downtown bars
30.535	and on street corners,
32.158	so this mightn't be
32.158	the most appropriate setting,
35.254	but I'd like to give you guys
35.254	a bit of a demonstration
39.087	about what I do.
45.685	(Beatboxing)
134.108	And now, for my next number,
137.776	I'd like to return to the classics.
142.31	(Applause)
144.38	We're going to take it back,
146.767	way back,
148.9	back into time.
154.155	"(Beatboxing: ""Billie Jean"")"
173.987	♫ Billie Jean is not my lover ♫
177.739	♫ She's just a girl who claims
177.739	that I am the one ♫
182.67	♫ But the kid is not my son ♫
186.643	(Applause) All right.
193.78	Wassup.
196.483	Thank you very much, TEDx.
198.992	If you guys haven't
198.992	figured it out already,
201.522	my name's Tom Thum, and I'm a beatboxer,
203.743	which means all the sounds
203.743	that you just heard
206.144	were made entirely using just my voice,
209.095	and the only thing was my voice.
211.208	And I can assure you
213.15	there are absolutely no effects
217.8	on this microphone whatsoever.
223.171	And I'm very, very stoked —
225.328	(Applause)
226.669	You guys are just applauding
226.669	for everything. It's great.
230.423	Look at this, Mom! I made it!
234.831	I'm very, very stoked to be here today,
237.907	representing my kinfolk
239.931	and all those that haven't
239.931	managed to make a career
243.159	out of an innate ability
243.159	for inhuman noisemaking.
246.757	Because it is a bit of a niche market,
249.692	and there's not much work going on,
252.056	especially where I'm from.
253.542	You know, I'm from Brisbane,
254.9	which is a great city to live in.
256.522	Yeah! All right! Most of Brisbane's here.
256.522	That's good.
259.405	(Laughter)
260.922	You know, I'm from Brizzy,
263.283	which is a great city to live in,
264.99	but let's be honest --
266.361	it's not exactly the cultural
266.361	hub of the Southern Hemisphere.
270.226	So I do a lot of my work outside Brisbane
273.63	and outside Australia,
275.398	and so the pursuit of this
275.398	crazy passion of mine
278.493	has enabled me to see
279.863	so many amazing places in the world.
282.415	So I'd like to share with you,
282.415	if I may, my experiences.
287.758	So ladies and gentlemen,
289.676	I would like to take you on a journey
292.649	throughout the continents
294.206	and throughout sound itself.
298.383	We start our journey
298.383	in the central deserts.
302.712	(Didgeridoo)
312.686	(Airplane)
316.221	India.
317.641	(Beatboxing)
331.717	(Sitar)
337.087	China.
338.872	(Guzheng)
351.714	(Beatboxing)
358.513	Germany.
360.626	(Beatboxing)
379.077	Party, party, yeah.
380.819	(Laughter)
385.93	And before we reach our final destination,
389.387	ladies and gentlemen,
390.99	I would like to share
390.99	with you some technology
393.324	that I brought all the way
393.324	from the thriving metropolis of Brisbane.
396.587	These things in front of me
396.587	here are called Kaoss Pads,
400.632	and they allow me to do a whole
400.632	lot of different things
403.66	with my voice.
405.769	For example, the one on the left here
408.267	allows me to add
410.512	a little bit of reverb to my sound,
413.609	which gives me that --
415.248	(Trumpet) --
421.48	flavor.
423.054	(Laughter)
424.406	And the other ones here,
426.112	I can use them in unison
428.198	to mimic the effect of a drum machine
431.027	or something like that.
432.094	I can sample in my own sounds
432.094	and I can play it back
434.957	just by hitting the pads here.
440	(Noises)
453.559	TEDx.
459.629	(Music)
477.791	(Applause)
481.908	I got way too much time on my hands.
486.288	And last but not least,
487.646	the one on my right here allows me to
490.692	loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop
494.352	my voice.
496.959	So with all that in mind,
496.959	ladies and gentlemen,
500.029	I would like to take you on a journey
502.879	to a completely separate part of Earth
505.159	as I transform the Sydney Opera House
507.832	into a smoky downtown jazz bar.
512.119	All right boys, take it away.
515.938	(Music)
525.482	Ladies and gentlemen,
525.482	I'd like to introduce you
527.278	to a very special friend of mine,
528.874	one of the greatest
528.874	double bassists I know.
531.052	Mr. Smokey Jefferson, let's take
531.052	it for a walk. Come on, baby.
535.606	(Music)
578.946	All right, ladies and gentlemen,
580.494	I'd like to introduce you
580.494	to the star of the show,
582.899	one of the greatest jazz
582.899	legends of our time.
585.186	Music lovers and jazz lovers alike,
587.787	please give a warm hand of applause
589.97	for the one and only Mr. Peeping Tom.
589.97	Take it away.
593.729	(Music)
598.187	(Applause)
674.33	Thank you. Thank you very much.
676.417	(Applause)
