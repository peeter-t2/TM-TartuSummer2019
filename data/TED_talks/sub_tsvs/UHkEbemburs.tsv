12.583	The Earth needs no introduction.
15.786	It needs no introduction in part 
15.786	because the Apollo 17 astronauts,
20.596	when they were hurtling 
20.596	around the moon in 1972,
23.324	took this iconic image.
27.396	It galvanized a whole 
27.396	generation of human beings
30.875	to realize that we're on 
30.875	Spaceship Earth,
33.553	fragile and finite as it is,
35.84	and that we need 
35.84	to take care of it.
37.643	But while this picture
37.643	is beautiful, it's static,
40.624	and the Earth is constantly changing.
43.177	It's changing on days' time
43.177	scales with human activity.
46.676	And the satellite imagery we 
46.676	have of it today is old.
49.975	Typically, years old.
52.47	And that's important because
52.47	you can't fix what you can't see.
56.735	What we'd ideally want is images
56.735	of the whole planet every day.
61.595	So, what's standing in our way?
63.871	What's the problem?
65.882	This is the problem:
67.908	Satellites are big, expensive 
67.908	and they're slow.
72.191	This one weighs three tons.
74.332	It's six meters tall, four meters wide.
77.097	It took up the entire fairing
77.097	of a rocket just to launch it.
80.33	One satellite, one rocket.
82.18	It cost 855 million dollars.
85.38	Satellites like these have 
85.38	done an amazing job
87.614	at helping us to understand our planet.
90.73	But if we want to understand 
90.73	it much more regularly,
94.356	we need lots of satellites,
96.402	and this model isn't scalable.
98.373	So me and my friends, 
98.373	we started Planet Labs
100.476	to make satellites ultra-compact
102.562	and small and highly capable.
104.849	I'm going to show you what 
104.849	our satellite looks like:
112.363	This is our satellite.
114.9	This is not a scale model,
116.863	this is the real size.
118.371	It's 10 by 10 by 30 centimeters,
120.757	it weighs four kilograms,
123.046	and we've stuffed the latest 
123.046	and greatest electronics
125.583	and sensor systems into 
125.583	this little package
127.84	so that even though this is really small,
129.884	this can take pictures 10 times the
129.884	resolution of the big satellite here,
134.977	even though it weighs one 
134.977	thousandth of the mass.
139.387	And we call this satellite 
139.387	"""Dove"" — Thank you."
143.14	(Applause)
145.435	"We call this satellite ""Dove,"""
147.48	"and we call it ""Dove"" because "
147.48	satellites are typically named
150.499	after birds, but normally birds of prey:
152.865	like Eagle, Hawk, Swoop, 
152.865	Kill, I don't know,
155.702	Kestrel, these sort of things.
157.417	But ours have a 
157.417	humanitarian mission,
159.342	so we wanted to call them Doves.
161.175	And we haven't just 
161.175	built them, though.
163.109	We've launched them.
164.45	And not just one, but many.
170.586	It all started in our garage.
172.953	Yes, we built our first satellite
172.953	prototype in our garage.
175.767	Now, this is pretty normal for a
175.767	Silicon Valley company that we are,
178.984	but we believe it's the first time 
178.984	for a space company.
181.927	And that's not the only trick
181.927	we learned from Silicon Valley.
185.395	We rapidly prototype our satellites.
188.587	"We use ""release early, "
188.587	"release often"" on our software."
191.472	And we take a different 
191.472	risk approach.
193.389	We take them outside and test them.
195.392	We even put satellites in space
195.392	just to test the satellites,
198.281	and we've learned to manufacture
198.281	our satellites at scale.
201.144	We've used modern production techniques
203.21	so we can build large numbers of them,
205.923	I think for the first time.
208.12	We call it agile aerospace,
211.12	and that's what's enabled us to put
211.12	so much capability into this little box.
216.808	Now, what has bonded 
216.808	our team over the years
221.3	is the idea of democratizing
221.3	access to satellite information.
226.436	In fact, the founders of our 
226.436	company, Chris, Robbie and I,
229.221	we met over 15 years ago 
229.221	at the United Nations
231.526	when they were hosting a conference 
231.526	about exactly that question:
234.511	How do you use satellites 
234.511	to help humanity?
236.18	How do you use satellites to help 
236.18	people in developing countries
237.932	or with climate change?
239.939	And this is what has bonded us.
242.405	Our entire team is passionate about
242.405	using satellites to help humanity.
246.97	You could say 
246.97	we're space geeks,
248.747	but not only do we care 
248.747	about what's up there,
251.284	we care about what's down here, too.
253.376	I'm going to show you a video
255.102	from just four weeks ago 
255.102	of two of our satellites
257.561	being launched from the
257.561	International Space Station.
260.45	This is not an animation, 
262.24	this is a video taken by the astronaut 
262.24	looking out of the window.
265.49	It gives you a bit of a sense of 
265.49	scale of our two satellites.
268.479	It's like some of the 
268.479	smallest satellites ever
270.796	are being launched from 
270.796	the biggest satellite ever.
273.29	And right at the end, the
273.29	solar array glints in the sun.
275.872	It's really cool. Wait for it.
278.241	Boom! Yeah. It's the money shot.
281.854	(Laughter)
283.864	So we didn't just launch 
283.864	two of them like this,
286.875	we launched 28 of them.
288.601	It's the largest constellation of
288.601	Earth-imaging satellites in human history,
292.214	and it's going to provide a
292.214	completely radical new data set
295.463	about our changing planet.
297.467	But that's just the beginning.
299.695	You see, we're going to launch
299.695	more than 100 of these satellites
302.777	like these over the 
302.777	course of the next year.
305.031	It's going to be the largest constellation
305.031	of satellites in human history.
308.68	And this is what it's going to do:
310.337	Acting in a single-orbit plane that 
310.337	stays fixed with respect to the sun,
313.896	the Earth rotates underneath.
315.569	They're all cameras pointed down,
317.864	and they slowly scan across as 
317.864	the Earth rotates underneath.
320.833	The Earth rotates every 24 hours,
322.957	so we scan every point on the 
322.957	planet every 24 hours.
325.929	It's a line scanner for the planet.
328.18	We don't take a picture of 
328.18	anywhere on the planet every day,
331.634	we take a picture of every single
331.634	place on the planet every day.
334.82	Even though we launched these
334.82	just a couple of weeks ago,
337.513	we've already got some initial
337.513	imagery from the satellites
340.278	and I'm going to show it
340.278	publicly for the first time right now.
343.694	This is the very first picture
343.694	taken by our satellite.
346.504	It happened to be over 
346.504	UC-Davis' campus
348.5	in California when we 
348.5	turned the camera on.
350.544	But what's even cooler is when
352.073	we compare it to the previous
352.073	latest image of that area,
355.2	which was taken many months ago.
357.609	And the image on the left 
357.609	is from our satellite,
360.174	and we see buildings are being built.
362.221	The general point is that we will be able
362.221	to track urban growth as it happens
366.21	around the whole world
366.21	in all cities, every day.
370.052	Water as well.
371.579	Thank you.
373.42	(Applause)
374.987	We'll be able to see 
374.987	the extent of all water bodies
377.609	around the whole world every day
377.609	and help water security.
380.82	From water security 
380.82	to food security.
382.992	We'll see crops as they 
382.992	grow in all the fields
385.495	in every farmer's field around
385.495	the planet every day.
388.52	and help them to improve crop yield.
391.423	This is a beautiful image that was taken
393.562	just a few hours ago when the 
393.562	satellite was flying over Argentina.
397.68	The general point is
399.104	there are probably hundreds and 
399.104	thousands of applications of this data,
402.517	I've mentioned a few, but there's others:
404.469	deforestation, the ice caps melting.
406.193	We can track all of these things,
406.193	every tree on the planet every day.
409.48	If you took the difference between
409.48	today's image and yesterday's image,
412.598	you'd see much of the world news —
412.598	you'd see floods and fires and earthquakes.
416.674	And we have decided, therefore, that the 
416.674	best thing that we could do with our data
420.283	is to ensure universal access to it.
423.275	We want to ensure everyone can see it.
425.4	Thank you. (Applause)
428.979	We want to empower NGOs and 
428.979	companies and scientists and journalists
432.78	to be able to answer the questions
432.78	that they have about the planet.
436.254	We want to enable the developer community
436.254	to run their apps on our data.
441.413	In short, we want to democratize access
441.413	to information about our planet.
445.511	Which brings me back to this.
448.311	You see, this will be an entirely
448.311	new global data set.
452.874	And we believe that together,
454.801	we can help to take care 
454.801	of our Spaceship Earth.
459.384	And what I would like to leave
459.384	you with is the following question:
462.899	If you had access to imagery of the
462.899	whole planet every single day,
467.17	what would you do with that data?
468.804	What problems would you solve?
470.412	What exploration would you do?
472.382	Well, I invite you to come
472.382	and explore with us.
474.474	Thank you very much.
476.08	(Applause)
