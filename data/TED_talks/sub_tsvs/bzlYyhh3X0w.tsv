12.96	I'm here today to talk to you
12.96	about a very powerful little word,
17.52	one that people will do almost anything
20.08	to avoid becoming.
22.28	Billion-dollar industries thrive
24.56	because of the fear of it,
26.36	and those of us who undeniably are it
29.56	are left to navigate a relentless storm
31.92	surrounding it.
34.12	I'm not sure if any of you have noticed,
36.88	but I'm fat.
39.6	Not the lowercase,
39.6	muttered-behind-my-back kind,
42.6	or the seemingly harmless
42.6	chubby or cuddly.
46	I'm not even the more sophisticated
46	voluptuous or curvaceous kind.
51.72	Let's not sugarcoat it.
53.72	I am the capital F-A-T kind of fat.
57.6	I am the elephant in the room.
62.04	When I walked out on stage,
63.6	some of you may have been thinking,
65.32	"""Aww, this is going to be hilarious,"
67.76	because everybody knows
67.76	"that fat people are funny."""
70.4	(Laughter)
72.44	Or you may have been thinking,
72.44	"""Where does she get her confidence from?"""
76.599	Because a confident fat woman
76.599	is almost unthinkable.
80.8	The fashion-conscious
80.8	members of the audience
83.04	may have been thinking how fabulous I look
85.72	in this Beth Ditto dress --
87.32	(Cheers)
88.56	thank you very much.
90.48	Whereas some of you might have thought,
92.4	"""Hmm, black would have been"
92.4	"so much more slimming."""
95.08	(Laughter)
96.36	You may have wondered, consciously or not,
98.88	if I have diabetes, or a partner,
101.84	or if I eat carbs after 7pm.
104.08	(Laughter)
105.36	You may have worried
105.36	that you ate carbs after 7pm last night,
109.32	and that you really should renew
109.32	your gym membership.
113.32	These judgments are insidious.
115.6	They can be directed
115.6	at individuals and groups,
118.2	and they can also
118.2	be directed at ourselves.
121.36	And this way of thinking
121.36	is known as fatphobia.
125.8	Like any form of systematic oppression,
128.24	fatphobia is deeply rooted
128.24	in complex structures
131.92	like capitalism, patriarchy and racism,
136	and that can make it
136	really difficult to see,
138.8	let alone challenge.
141	We live in a culture
142.28	where being fat
142.28	is seen as being a bad person --
147.28	lazy, greedy, unhealthy, irresponsible
151.12	and morally suspect.
153.44	And we tend to see thinness
155.04	as being universally good --
158.04	responsible, successful,
160.08	and in control of our appetites,
160.08	bodies and lives.
164.24	We see these ideas again and again
166.6	in the media, in public health policy,
169.56	doctors' offices,
171.2	in everyday conversations
173.4	and in our own attitudes.
175.88	We may even blame fat people themselves
178.88	for the discrimination they face
180.48	because, after all, if we don't like it,
180.48	we should just lose weight.
185.2	Easy.
187.36	This antifat bias has become
187.36	so integral, so ingrained
191.88	to how we value ourselves and each other
194.44	that we rarely question why
194.44	we have such contempt for people of size
200.2	and where that disdain comes from.
202.96	But we must question it,
204.92	because the enormous value
204.92	we place on how we look
208.12	affects every one of us.
211	And do we really want to live in a society
213.56	where people are denied
213.56	their basic humanity
216.52	if they don't subscribe
216.52	to some arbitrary form of acceptable?
222.2	So when I was six years old,
223.96	my sister used to teach ballet
223.96	to a bunch of little girls in our garage.
228.52	I was about a foot taller and a foot wider
228.52	than most of the group.
232.4	When it came to doing
232.4	our first performance,
234.56	I was so excited
234.56	about wearing a pretty pink tutu.
239.2	I was going to sparkle.
242.8	As the other girls slipped easily
242.8	into their Lycra and tulle creations,
246.96	not one of the tutus
246.96	was big enough to fit me.
250.72	I was determined not to be
250.72	excluded from the performance,
254.88	so I turned to my mother
257.72	and loud enough for everyone to hear
260.68	"said, ""Mom, I don't need a tutu."
264.32	"I need a fourfour."""
266.52	(Laughter)
269.76	Thanks, Mom.
271	(Applause)
274.56	And although I didn't
274.56	recognize it at the time,
277	claiming space for myself
277	in that glorious fourfour
280.28	was the first step towards becoming
280.28	a radical fat activist.
286.08	Now, I'm not saying
286.08	that this whole body-love thing
288.72	has been an easy skip along
288.72	a glittering path of self-acceptance
293	since that day in class.
294.92	Far from it.
296.76	I soon learned that living outside
296.76	what the mainstream considers normal
300.96	can be a frustrating and isolating place.
304.64	I've spent the last 20 years unpacking
304.64	and deprogramming these messages,
309.36	and it's been quite the roller coaster.
312.88	I've been openly laughed at,
312.88	abused from passing cars
316.92	and been told that I'm delusional.
319.4	I also receive smiles from strangers
321.88	who recognize what it takes
321.88	to walk down the street
324.72	with a spring in your step
324.72	and your head held high.
327.32	(Cheer)
328.68	Thanks.
330.04	And through it all, that fierce
330.04	little six-year-old has stayed with me,
334.12	and she has helped me
334.12	stand before you today
337	as an unapologetic fat person,
340.04	a person that simply refuses to subscribe
343.16	to the dominant narrative
344.6	about how I should move
344.6	through the world in this body of mine.
348.32	(Applause)
356.24	And I'm not alone.
358.44	I am part of an international
358.44	community of people
361.6	who choose to, rather
361.6	than passively accepting
364.24	that our bodies are
364.24	and probably always will be big,
368.2	we actively choose to flourish
368.2	in these bodies as they are today.
373.28	People who honor our strength
373.28	and work with, not against,
377.08	our perceived limitations,
379.48	people who value health
381.32	as something much more holistic
383.8	than a number on an outdated BMI chart.
387	Instead, we value mental health,
387	self-worth and how we feel in our bodies
393.12	as vital aspects
393.12	to our overall well-being.
397.56	People who refuse to believe
397.56	that living in these fat bodies
400.8	is a barrier to anything, really.
405.4	There are doctors, academics and bloggers
408.68	who have written countless volumes
410.88	on the many facets
410.88	of this complex subject.
414.72	There are fatshionistas
414.72	who reclaim their bodies and their beauty
419.64	by wearing fatkinis and crop tops,
422.6	exposing the flesh
422.6	that we're all taught to hide.
426.2	There are fat athletes
427.8	who run marathons,
427.8	teach yoga or do kickboxing,
431.8	all done with a middle finger
431.8	firmly held up to the status quo.
437.56	And these people have taught me
437.56	that radical body politics
441.08	is the antidote
441.08	to our body-shaming culture.
445.76	But to be clear, I'm not saying
445.76	that people shouldn't change their bodies
450.48	if that's what they want to do.
452.6	Reclaiming yourself can be one
452.6	of the most gorgeous acts of self-love
456.6	and can look like
456.6	a million different things,
459.92	from hairstyles to tattoos
459.92	to body contouring
463.72	to hormones to surgery
463.72	and yes, even weight loss.
467.32	It's simple: it's your body,
469.64	and you decide what's best to do with it.
472.92	My way of engaging in activism
475.84	is by doing all the things
475.84	that we fatties aren't supposed to do,
478.96	and there's a lot of them,
480.52	inviting other people to join me
480.52	and then making art about it.
485.72	The common thread
485.72	through most of this work
487.8	has been reclaiming spaces that are
487.8	often prohibitive to bigger bodies,
492.48	from the catwalk to club shows,
495.44	from public swimming pools
495.44	to prominent dance stages.
500.28	And reclaiming spaces en masse
500.28	is not only a powerful artistic statement
505.44	but a radical community-building approach.
509.12	"This was so true of ""AQUAPORKO!"" --"
511.96	(Laughter)
513.92	the fat fem synchronized swim team
516.56	I started with a group
516.56	of friends in Sydney.
520.4	The impact of seeing
520.4	a bunch of defiant fat women
523.8	in flowery swimming caps and bathers
526.039	throwing their legs in the air
526.039	without a care
528.88	should not be underestimated.
533.4	(Laughter)
536.44	Throughout my career, I have learned
536.44	that fat bodies are inherently political,
542.04	and unapologetic fat bodies
544.16	can blow people's minds.
548.36	When director Kate Champion,
550.76	of acclaimed dance theater
550.76	company Force Majeure,
553.76	asked me to be the artistic associate
556.24	on a work featuring all fat dancers,
559.56	I literally jumped at the opportunity.
563.64	And I mean literally.
566.72	"""Nothing to Lose"" is a work made"
566.72	in collaboration with performers of size
570.92	who drew from their lived experiences
573.52	to create a work as varied
573.52	and authentic as we all are.
578.08	And it was as far from ballet
578.08	as you could imagine.
582.12	The very idea of a fat dance work
582.12	by such a prestigious company
586.96	was, to put it mildly, controversial,
591.08	because nothing like it had ever been done
591.08	on mainstream dance stages before
596.12	anywhere in the world.
599.2	People were skeptical.
601.8	"""What do you mean, 'fat dancers?'"
605.4	Like, size 10, size 12 kind of fat?
610.84	Where did they do their dance training?
613.92	Are they going to have the stamina
613.92	"for a full-length production?"""
618.76	But despite the skepticism,
620.72	"""Nothing to Lose"" became"
620.72	a sellout hit of Sydney Festival.
624.84	We received rave reviews, toured,
627.2	won awards and were written about
627.2	in over 27 languages.
631.76	These incredible images of our cast
631.76	were seen worldwide.
637.44	I've lost count of how many times
637.44	people of all sizes
642	have told me that the show
642	has changed their lives,
645.12	how it helped them
645.12	shift their relationship
647.16	to their own and other people's bodies,
649.52	and how it made them confront
649.52	their own bias.
653.44	But of course, work
653.44	that pushes people's buttons
656.8	is not without its detractors.
659.96	I have been told
659.96	that I'm glorifying obesity.
663.32	I have received violent death threats
665.84	and abuse for daring to make work
665.84	that centers fat people's bodies and lives
671.32	and treats us as worthwhile human beings
671.32	with valuable stories to tell.
678.04	I've even been called
679.64	"""the ISIS of the obesity epidemic"" --"
682.6	(Laughter)
684.32	a comment so absurd that it is funny.
688	But it also speaks to the panic,
690.8	the literal terror,
692.8	that the fear of fat can evoke.
695.6	It is this fear that's feeding
695.6	the diet industry,
699	which is keeping so many of us
699	from making peace with our own bodies,
703.8	for waiting to be the after-photo
706.12	before we truly start to live our lives.
709.4	Because the real elephant
709.4	in the room here is fatphobia.
714.48	Fat activism refuses to indulge this fear.
718.56	By advocating for self-determination
718.56	and respect for all of us,
722.88	we can shift society's reluctance
722.88	to embrace diversity
726.84	and start to celebrate the myriad ways
726.84	there are to have a body.
732.48	Thank you.
733.76	(Applause)
