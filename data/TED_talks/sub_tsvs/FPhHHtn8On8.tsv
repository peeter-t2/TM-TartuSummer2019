12.906	Hetain Patel: (In Chinese)
23.303	Yuyu Rau: Hi, I'm Hetain. I'm an artist.
26.606	And this is Yuyu,
28.467	who is a dancer I have been working with.
30.886	I have asked her to translate for me.
34.492	HP: (In Chinese)
39.182	YR: If I may, I would like to tell you
41.89	a little bit about myself
43.62	and my artwork.
45.916	HP: (In Chinese)
51.459	YR: I was born and raised near Manchester,
54.583	in England,
55.55	but I'm not going to say it in English to you,
59.122	because I'm trying to avoid any assumptions
61.883	that might be made from my northern accent.
64.965	(Laughter)
67.54	HP: (In Chinese)
76.975	YR: The only problem with masking it
79.487	with Chinese Mandarin
81.037	is I can only speak this paragraph,
83.755	which I have learned by heart
85.534	when I was visiting in China. (Laughter)
88.204	So all I can do is keep repeating it in different tones
92.092	and hope you won't notice.
93.952	(Laughter)
99.301	HP: (In Chinese)
103.481	(Laughter)
104.848	YR: Needless to say, I would like to apologize
107.961	to any Mandarin speakers in the audience.
114.214	As a child, I would hate being made
116.887	to wear the Indian kurta pajama,
119.515	because I didn't think it was very cool.
122.513	It felt a bit girly to me, like a dress,
125.814	and it had this baggy trouser part
128.472	you had to tie really tight
130.715	to avoid the embarrassment of them falling down.
134.139	My dad never wore it,
136.175	so I didn't see why I had to.
139.1	Also, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable,
142.453	that people assume I represent something
145.148	genuinely Indian when I wear it,
147.474	because that's not how I feel.
150.923	HP: (In Chinese)
156.775	YR: Actually, the only way I feel comfortable
159.702	wearing it is by pretending
162.11	they are the robes of a kung fu warrior
165.321	like Li Mu Bai from that film,
168.06	"""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."""
172.373	(Music)
215.383	Okay.
216.992	So my artwork is about identity and language,
224.063	challenging common assumptions
226.793	based on how we look like or where we come from,
231.338	gender, race, class.
235.082	What makes us who we are anyway?
238.933	HP: (In Chinese)
244.88	YR: I used to read Spider-Man comics,
247.256	watch kung fu movies,
248.831	take philosophy lessons from Bruce Lee.
251.616	He would say things like --
253.265	HP: Empty your mind.
255.352	(Laughter)
256.416	Be formless, shapeless, like water.
262.429	Now you put water into a cup.
264.419	It becomes the cup.
267.315	You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.
270.422	Put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.
273.801	Now, water can flow
276.45	or it can crash.
279.1	Be water, my friend. (Applause)
282.455	YR: This year, I am 32 years old,
286.557	the same age Bruce Lee was when he died.
289.676	I have been wondering recently,
292.27	if he were alive today,
294.2	what advice he would give me
296.226	about making this TED Talk.
300.17	HP: Don't imitate my voice.
303.908	It offends me.
305.979	(Laughter)
308.009	YR: Good advice,
309.76	but I still think that we learn who we are
313.472	by copying others.
315.575	Who here hasn't imitated their childhood hero
319.792	in the playground, or mum or father?
323.687	I have.
325.948	HP: A few years ago, in order to make this video
330.49	for my artwork, I shaved off all my hair
334.495	so that I could grow it back as my father had it
337.638	when he first emigrated from India
340.404	to the U.K. in the 1960s.
343.668	He had a side parting and a neat mustache.
347.798	At first, it was going very well.
350.417	I even started to get discounts in Indian shops.
353.467	(Laughter)
357.468	But then very quickly,
359.092	I started to underestimate
360.839	my mustache growing ability,
362.519	and it got way too big.
365.921	It didn't look Indian anymore.
368.668	Instead, people from across the road,
370.511	they would shout things like --
372.402	HP and YR: Arriba! Arriba! Ándale! Ándale!
374.618	(Laughter)
376.619	HP: Actually, I don't know why I am even talking like this.
378.983	My dad doesn't even have an Indian accent anymore.
381.987	He talks like this now.
384.514	So it's not just my father that I've imitated.
388.542	A few years ago I went to China for a few months,
392.14	and I couldn't speak Chinese,
394.974	and this frustrated me,
396.786	so I wrote about this and had it translated
400.738	into Chinese, and then I learned this by heart,
407.225	like music, I guess.
410.422	YR: This phrase is now etched into my mind
413.763	clearer than the pin number to my bank card,
416.642	so I can pretend I speak Chinese fluently.
420.57	When I had learned this phrase,
422.618	I had an artist over there hear me out
425.354	to see how accurate it sounded.
427.823	I spoke the phrase, and then he laughed
430.309	"and told me, ""Oh yeah, that's great,"
433.12	"only it kind of sounds like a woman."""
435.493	"I said, ""What?"""
436.955	"He said, ""Yeah, you learned from a woman?"""
440.877	"I said, ""Yes. So?"""
442.881	He then explained the tonal differences
445.522	between male and female voices
447.772	are very different and distinct, and that I had learned it very well,
451.574	but in a woman's voice.
453.567	(Laughter)
455.79	(Applause)
463.1	HP: Okay. So this imitation business
466.519	does come with risk.
468.204	It doesn't always go as you plan it,
470.912	even with a talented translator.
474.382	But I am going to stick with it,
476.668	because contrary to what we might usually assume,
481.033	imitating somebody can reveal something unique.
485.132	So every time I fail
488.387	to become more like my father,
490.943	I become more like myself.
494.838	Every time I fail to become Bruce Lee,
499.42	I become more authentically me.
503.066	This is my art.
504.551	I strive for authenticity,
507.871	even if it comes in a shape
510.106	that we might not usually expect.
513.802	It's only recently that I've started to understand
518.038	that I didn't learn to sit like this
521.745	through being Indian.
523.891	I learned this from Spider-Man.
527.167	(Laughter)
528.905	Thank you.
530.462	(Applause)
