37.117	Good afternoon.
39.412	As you're all aware, we face difficult economic times.
43.873	I come to you with a modest proposal
46.325	for easing the financial burden.
48.857	This idea came to me while talking to
50.39	a physicist friend of mine at MIT.
53.362	He was struggling to explain something to me:
56.051	a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter.
60.627	Now he confused me from the very start,
62.534	because light doesn't cool things down.
64.888	It makes it hotter. It's happening right now.
68.337	The reason that you can see me standing here is because
70.88	this room is filled with more than 100 quintillion photons,
74.652	and they're moving randomly through the space, near the speed of light.
78.187	All of them are different colors,
79.703	they're rippling with different frequencies,
81.643	and they're bouncing off every surface, including me,
84.518	and some of those are flying directly into your eyes,
86.928	and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here.
90.128	Now a laser is different.
91.783	It also uses photons, but they're all synchronized,
95.786	and if you focus them into a beam,
98.493	what you have is an incredibly useful tool.
100.888	The control of a laser is so precise
103.024	that you can perform surgery inside of an eye,
105.698	you can use it to store massive amounts of data,
108.343	and you can use it for this beautiful experiment
110.673	that my friend was struggling to explain.
113.146	First you trap atoms in a special bottle.
116.401	It uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms
119.361	from the noise of the environment.
121.547	And the atoms themselves are quite violent,
124.03	but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency,
128.074	an atom will briefly absorb those photons
130.702	and tend to slow down.
132.585	Little by little it gets colder
135.897	until eventually it approaches absolute zero.
140.41	Now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough,
143.586	something truly bizarre happens.
147.363	It's no longer a solid, a liquid or a gas.
150.185	It enters a new state of matter called a superfluid.
154.125	The atoms lose their individual identity,
156.412	and the rules from the quantum world take over,
159.239	and that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties.
163.334	For example, if you shine light through a superfluid,
166.786	it is able to slow photons down
169.811	to 60 kilometers per hour.
179.585	Another spooky property is that it flows
182.638	with absolutely no viscosity or friction,
185.274	so if you were to take the lid off that bottle,
187.538	it won't stay inside.
189.633	A thin film will creep up the inside wall,
192.41	flow over the top and right out the outside.
196.634	Now of course, the moment that it does hit the outside environment,
199.591	and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree,
203.307	it immediately turns back into normal matter.
205.43	Superfluids are one of the most fragile things we've ever discovered.
208.996	And this is the great pleasure of science:
211.357	the defeat of our intuition through experimentation.
215.572	But the experiment is not the end of the story,
217.261	because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people.
220.787	I have a Ph.D in molecular biology.
223.163	I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about.
226.696	So as my friend was trying to explain that experiment,
229.646	it seemed like the more he said,
232.592	the less I understood.
235.565	Because if you're trying to give someone the big picture
237.936	of a complex idea, to really capture its essence,
242.015	the fewer words you use, the better.
245.598	In fact, the ideal may be to use no words at all.
248.917	I remember thinking, my friend could have explained
250.474	that entire experiment with a dance.
253.606	Of course, there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them.
257.974	Now, the idea is not as crazy as it sounds.
259.863	I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D.
263.365	Instead of explaining their research with words,
265.98	scientists have to explain it with dance.
268.88	Now surprisingly, it seems to work.
271.249	Dance really can make science easier to understand.
274.521	But don't take my word for it.
276.317	"Go on the Internet and search for ""Dance Your Ph.D."""
279.204	There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you.
282.462	The most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest
284.545	is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research.
289.834	For example, at the University of Minnesota,
291.714	there's a biomedical engineer named David Odde,
294.219	and he works with dancers to study how cells move.
297.377	They do it by changing their shape.
299.786	When a chemical signal washes up on one side,
302.605	it triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side,
305.73	because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment.
309.011	So that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions.
312.982	But what seems so slow and graceful from the outside
316.92	is really more like chaos inside,
319.349	because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers,
323.752	and those fibers are constantly falling apart.
326.597	But just as quickly as they explode,
329.166	more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer,
331.583	so it's constantly changing
333.766	just to remain exactly the same.
336.764	Now, David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab,
339.934	but before he does that, he works with dancers
342.709	to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place.
346.41	It's basically efficient brainstorming,
349.503	and when I visited David to learn about his research,
351.758	he used dancers to explain it to me
355.102	rather than the usual method: PowerPoint.
359.644	And this brings me to my modest proposal.
361.997	I think that bad PowerPoint presentations
364.866	are a serious threat to the global economy.
367.538	(Laughter) (Applause)
375.467	Now it does depend on how you measure it, of course,
380.346	but one estimate has put the drain at 250 million dollars per day.
385.115	Now that assumes half-hour presentations
387.296	for an average audience of four people
389.353	with salaries of 35,000 dollars,
391.672	and it conservatively assumes that
393.632	about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time,
397.564	and given that there are some apparently
403.415	that would indeed add up to an annual waste
406.303	of 100 billion dollars.
409.399	Of course, that's just the time we're losing
411.767	sitting through presentations.
413.99	There are other costs, because PowerPoint is a tool,
418.306	and like any tool, it can and will be abused.
421.636	To borrow a concept from my country's CIA,
424.126	it helps you to soften up your audience.
427.241	It distracts them with pretty pictures, irrelevant data.
431.489	It allows you to create the illusion of competence,
435.229	the illusion of simplicity,
437.989	and most destructively, the illusion of understanding.
442.716	So now my country is 15 trillion dollars in debt.
446.96	Our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money.
451.945	One idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts.
456.414	For example, our National Endowment for the Arts,
458.622	with its $150 million budget,
461.199	slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt
464.211	by about one one-thousandth of a percent.
467.572	One certainly can't argue with those numbers.
469.312	However, once we eliminate public funding for the arts,
474.594	there will be some drawbacks.
477.266	The artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed.
481.662	Many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution,
484.069	and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods.
487.188	All of this could wipe out the savings we're hoping to make in the first place.
492.095	I shall now, therefore, humbly propose my own thoughts,
495.336	which I hope will not be liable to the least objection.
499.118	Once we eliminate public funding for the artists,
501.011	let's put them back to work
502.598	by using them instead of PowerPoint.
505.619	As a test case, I propose we start with American dancers.
509.102	After all, they are the most perishable of their kind,
511.255	prone to injury and very slow to heal
513.414	due to our health care system.
516.231	Rather than dancing our Ph.Ds,
519.374	we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems.
522.988	Imagine our politicians using dance
525.848	to explain why we must invade a foreign country
529.626	or bail out an investment bank.
532.498	It's sure to help.
534.46	Of course someday, in the deep future,
538.212	a technology of persuasion
540.593	even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented,
544.022	rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric.
547.566	However, I trust that by that day,
550.142	we shall have passed this present financial calamity.
553.457	Perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury
556.823	of just sitting in an audience
559.943	with no other purpose
561.783	than to witness the human form in motion.
566.349	(Music)
