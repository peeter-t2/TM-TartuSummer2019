16.26	Today I'm going to take you on a voyage
18.26	to some place so deep,
20.26	so dark, so unexplored
23.26	that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon.
26.26	It's a place of myth and legend.
28.26	It's a place marked on ancient maps
30.26	"as ""here be monsters."""
33.26	It is a place where each new voyage of exploration
36.26	brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange
39.26	that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed.
42.26	Instead, they just make me green with envy
44.26	that my colleague from IUCN
46.26	was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts
49.26	to actually take photographs
51.26	and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep.
54.26	We are talking about the high seas.
57.26	"The ""high seas"" is a legal term,"
59.26	but in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet.
62.26	With an average depth of the oceans
64.26	of 4,000 meters,
66.26	in fact, the high seas covers and provides
69.26	nearly 90 percent of the habitat
72.26	for life on this Earth.
75.26	It is, in theory, the global commons,
77.26	belonging to us all.
79.26	But in reality,
81.26	it is managed by and for
83.26	those who have the resources
85.26	to go out and exploit it.
88.26	So today I'm going to take you on a voyage
90.26	to cast light on some of the outdated myths
92.26	and legends and assumptions
94.26	that have kept us as the true stakeholders
97.26	in the high seas in the dark.
99.26	We're going to voyage to some of these special places
102.26	that we've been discovering in the past few years
104.26	to show why we really need to care.
107.26	And then finally, we're going to try
109.26	to develop and pioneer a new perspective
111.26	on high seas governance
113.26	that's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation,
116.26	but framed in an arena of global norms
119.26	of precaution and respect.
122.26	So here is a picture of the high seas
124.26	as seen from above --
126.26	that area in the darker blue.
128.26	To me, as an international lawyer,
130.26	this scared me far more
132.26	than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen,
134.26	for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean,
137.26	the global ocean,
139.26	that provides us all with carbon storage,
141.26	with heat storage, with oxygen,
144.26	if you can only protect 36 percent.
148.26	This is indeed the true heart of the planet.
152.26	Some of the problems that we have to confront
154.26	are that the current international laws --
156.26	for example, shipping --
158.26	provide more protection
160.26	to the areas closest to shore.
162.26	For example, garbage discharge,
164.26	something you would think just simply goes away,
166.26	but the laws regulating
168.26	ship discharge of garbage
170.26	actually get weaker the further you are from shore.
173.26	As a result, we have garbage patches
176.26	the size of twice-Texas.
179.26	It's unbelievable.
181.26	We used to think the solution to pollution
184.26	was dilution,
186.26	but that has proved to be no longer the case.
189.26	So what we have learned from social scientists
192.26	and economists like Elinor Ostrom,
194.26	who are studying the phenomenon
196.26	of management of the commons on a local scale,
198.26	is that there are certain prerequisites
201.26	that you can put into place
203.26	that enable you to manage
205.26	and access open space
208.26	for the good of one and all.
211.26	And these include a sense of shared responsibility,
214.26	common norms that bind people together as a community.
217.26	Conditional access: You can invite people in,
220.26	but they have to be able to play by the rules.
223.26	And of course, if you want people to play by the rules,
225.26	you still need an effective system
227.26	of monitoring and enforcement,
229.26	for as we've discovered,
231.26	you can trust, but you also need to verify.
233.26	What I'd also like to convey
235.26	is that it is not all doom and gloom
237.26	that we are seeing in the high seas.
239.26	For a group of very dedicated individuals --
242.26	scientists, conservationists,
244.26	photographers and states --
247.26	were able to actually change a tragic trajectory
250.26	that was destroying fragile seascapes
252.26	such as this coral garden
254.26	that you see in front of you.
256.26	That is, we're able to save it from a fate
258.26	of deep-sea bottom trawling.
260.26	And how did we do that?
262.26	Well, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships
265.26	and actually photographed the activities in process.
268.26	But we also spent many hours
270.26	in the basements of the United Nations,
272.26	trying to work with governments to make them understand
275.26	what was going on so far away from land
277.26	that few of us had ever even imagined
279.26	that these creatures existed.
281.26	So within three years,
283.26	from 2003 to 2006,
286.26	we were able to get norm in place
288.26	that actually changed the paradigm
290.26	of how fishers went about
292.26	deep-sea bottom trawling.
294.26	"Instead of ""go anywhere, do anything you want,"""
297.26	we actually created a regime
299.26	that required prior assessment of where you're going
302.26	and a duty to prevent significant harm.
305.26	In 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress,
308.26	they discovered
310.26	that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed
313.26	had been protected.
315.26	This does not mean that it's the final solution,
317.26	or that this even provides permanent protection.
319.26	But what it does mean
321.26	is that a group of individuals can form a community
324.26	to actually shape
326.26	the way high seas are governed,
328.26	to create a new regime.
330.26	So I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities
333.26	for creating a true, blue perspective
336.26	for this beautiful planet.
338.26	Sylvia's wish
340.26	provides us with that leverage, that access
343.26	to the heart of human beings,
345.26	you might say,
347.26	who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes,
350.26	but are now hopefully going to become interested
353.26	in the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles,
356.26	who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas.
360.26	Today, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling
363.26	of some of these special areas,
365.26	just to give you an idea of the flavor
367.26	of the riches and wonders they do contain.
370.26	The Sargasso Sea, for example,
372.26	is not a sea bounded by coastlines,
374.26	but it is bounded by oceanic currents
377.26	that contain and envelope
379.26	this wealth of sargassum
381.26	that grows and aggregates there.
383.26	It's also known as the spawning ground for eels
387.26	from Northern European
389.26	and Northern American rivers
391.26	that are now so dwindling in numbers
393.26	that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm,
395.26	and five showed up in the U.K. just recently.
398.26	But the Sargasso Sea,
400.26	the same way it aggregates sargassum weed,
403.26	actually is pulling in the plastic
405.26	from throughout the region.
407.26	This picture doesn't exactly show
409.26	the plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself.
412.26	But there has just been a study
414.26	that was released in February
416.26	that showed there are 200,000
418.26	pieces of plastic per square-kilometer
421.26	now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea,
424.26	and that is affecting the habitat
426.26	for the many species in their juvenile stages
429.26	who come to the Sargasso Sea
431.26	for its protection and its food.
434.26	The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place
437.26	for the aggregation of these unique species
439.26	that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat.
442.26	It also provides a special habitat
444.26	for these flying fish to lay their eggs.
448.26	But what I'd like to get from this picture
450.26	is that we truly do have an opportunity
452.26	to launch a global initiative for protection.
455.26	Thus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need
458.26	and its responsibility
460.26	as having some of the Sargasso Sea
462.26	within its national jurisdiction --
464.26	but the vast majority is beyond --
466.26	to help spearhead a movement
468.26	to achieve protection for this vital area.
470.26	Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now:
473.26	the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean.
475.26	It's actually a bay.
477.26	It's considered high seas, because the continent
479.26	has been put off limits
481.26	to territorial claims.
483.26	So anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas.
486.26	But what makes the Ross Sea important
488.26	is the vast sea of pack ice
491.26	that in the spring and summer
493.26	provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill
495.26	that supports what, till recently,
497.26	has been a virtually intact
499.26	near-shore ecosystem.
502.26	But unfortunately, CCAMLR,
504.26	the regional commission
506.26	in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks
508.26	and other living marine resources,
510.26	is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests
513.26	and has authorized the expansion
515.26	of toothfish fisheries in the region.
518.26	The captain of a New Zealand vessel
520.26	who was just down there
522.26	is reporting a significant decline
524.26	in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales,
527.26	who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish
529.26	as their main source of food.
532.26	So what we need to do is to stand up boldly,
535.26	singly and together,
537.26	to push governments,
539.26	to push regional fisheries management organizations,
541.26	to declare our right
543.26	to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing,
546.26	so that the freedom to fish no longer means
548.26	the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime.
551.26	Coming closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome
554.26	is a recently discovered area --
556.26	potentially year-round habitat for blue whales.
558.26	There's enough food there to last them
560.26	the summer and the winter long.
562.26	But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome
564.26	is, in fact, it's not a permanent place.
566.26	It's an oceanographic phenomenon
568.26	that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis.
571.26	So, in fact, it's not permanently in the high seas.
573.26	It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones
576.26	of these five Central American countries,
578.26	but it moves with the season.
581.26	As such, it does create a challenge to protect,
584.26	but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it.
587.26	We can use the same technologies that fishers use
590.26	to identify where the species are,
592.26	in order to close the area
594.26	when it's most vulnerable,
596.26	which may, in some cases, be year-round.
599.26	Getting closer to shore, where we are,
601.26	this was in fact taken in the Galapagos.
603.26	Many species are headed through this region,
605.26	which is why there's been so much attention
607.26	put into conservation
609.26	of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.
611.26	This is the initiative that's been coordinated
613.26	by Conservation International
615.26	with a variety of partners and governments
617.26	to actually try to bring integrated management regime
620.26	throughout the area.
622.26	That is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go
624.26	with a real regional initiative.
626.26	It's protecting five World Heritage sites.
629.26	Unfortunately, the World Heritage Convention
632.26	does not recognize the need to protect areas
635.26	beyond national jurisdiction, at present.
638.26	So a place like the Costa Rica Dome
640.26	could not technically qualify
642.26	the time it's in the high seas.
644.26	So what we've been suggesting
646.26	is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention,
649.26	so that it can adopt
652.26	and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites,
655.26	or we need to change the name
657.26	and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention.
660.26	But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles
663.26	do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.
667.26	These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre,
670.26	where they spend most of their time
672.26	and often end up getting hooked like this,
674.26	or as bycatch.
676.26	So what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up.
679.26	We need to work locally,
681.26	but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide.
684.26	We have the tools and technologies now
687.26	to enable us to take a broader
689.26	ocean-basin-wide initiative.
691.26	We've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project,
694.26	one of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects.
697.26	It's provided us data like this,
699.26	of tiny, little sooty shearwaters
702.26	that make the entire ocean basin their home.
704.26	They fly 65,000 kilometers
706.26	in less than a year.
708.26	So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life.
711.26	And its culminating year
713.26	that's going to be launched in October.
715.26	So stay tuned for further information.
717.26	What I find so exciting
719.26	is that the Census of Marine Life
721.26	has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators;
724.26	it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column,
727.26	where creatures like this flying sea cucumber
729.26	have been found.
731.26	And fortunately, we've been able, as IUCN,
734.26	to team up with the Census of Marine Life
736.26	and many of the scientists working there
738.26	to actually try to translate
740.26	much of this information to policymakers.
742.26	We have the support of governments now behind us.
745.26	We've been revealing this information through technical workshops.
748.26	And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information
751.26	to move ahead to protect some of these
753.26	significant hope spots, hotspots.
756.26	At the same time we're saying,
758.26	"""Yes, we need more. We need to move forward."""
760.26	But many of you have said,
762.26	if you get these marine protected areas,
764.26	or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place,
767.26	how are you going to enforce it?
769.26	Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science,
772.26	which is outer space technology.
774.26	I wanted to be an astronaut,
776.26	so I've constantly followed
778.26	what are the tools available to monitor Earth
780.26	from outer space --
782.26	and that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about,
785.26	in terms of being able to follow tagged species
787.26	throughout their life-cycles
789.26	in the open ocean.
791.26	We can also tag and track fishing vessels.
794.26	Many already have transponders on board
797.26	that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing.
800.26	But not all the vessels have those to date.
802.26	It does not take too much rocket science
805.26	to actually try to create new laws to mandate,
808.26	if you're going to have the privilege
810.26	of accessing our high seas resources,
813.26	we need to know -- someone needs to know --
815.26	where you are and what you're doing.
818.26	So it brings me to my main take-home message,
820.26	which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons.
823.26	We can stop the collision course
825.26	of 50 percent of the planet
827.26	with the high seas.
829.26	But we need to think broad-scale. We need to think globally.
832.26	We need to change how we actually go about
834.26	managing these resources.
837.26	We need to get the new paradigm
839.26	of precaution and respect.
841.26	At the same time, we need to think locally,
843.26	which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish,
846.26	is that we can shine a spotlight
848.26	on many of these previously unknown areas,
851.26	and to bring people to the table, if you will,
854.26	to actually make them feel part of this community
857.26	that truly has a stake
859.26	in their future management.
861.26	And third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management.
864.26	Our species are ocean-basin-wide.
867.26	Many of the deep-sea communities
870.26	have genetic distribution
872.26	that goes ocean-basin-wide.
874.26	We need to better understand,
876.26	but we also need to start to manage and protect.
879.26	And in order to do that,
881.26	you also need ocean-basin management regimes.
883.26	That is, we have regional management regimes
886.26	within the exclusive economic zone,
888.26	but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity,
891.26	so they're like the Southern Ocean,
893.26	where they do have the two-pronged fisheries
895.26	and conservation organization.
898.26	So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor
901.26	Sylvia Earle for her wish,
903.26	for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas
905.26	and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction.
908.26	It's helping to bring an incredible group
910.26	of talented people together
912.26	to really try to solve and penetrate
914.26	these problems that have created our obstacles
917.26	to management and rational use
920.26	of this area that was once so far away and remote.
925.26	So on this tour, I hope I provided you
927.26	with a new perspective of the high seas:
929.26	one, that it is our home too,
932.26	and that we need to work together
934.26	if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all.
937.26	Thank you.
939.26	(Applause)
