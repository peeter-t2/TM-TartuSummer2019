12.705	In ancient Greece,
15.256	when anyone from slaves to soldiers,
15.256	poets and politicians,
19.223	needed to make a big decision
19.223	on life's most important questions,
23.251	"like, ""Should I get married?"""
24.666	"or ""Should we embark on this voyage?"""
26.547	"or ""Should our army"
26.547	"advance into this territory?"""
29.499	they all consulted the oracle.
32.84	So this is how it worked:
34.304	you would bring her a question
34.304	and you would get on your knees,
37.44	and then she would go into this trance.
39.335	It would take a couple of days,
40.908	and then eventually
40.908	she would come out of it,
43.095	giving you her predictions as your answer.
46.73	From the oracle bones of ancient China
49.32	to ancient Greece to Mayan calendars,
51.689	people have craved for prophecy
54.009	in order to find out
54.009	what's going to happen next.
58.336	And that's because we all want
58.336	to make the right decision.
61.599	We don't want to miss something.
63.712	The future is scary,
65.479	so it's much nicer
65.479	knowing that we can make a decision
68.22	with some assurance of the outcome.
70.899	Well, we have a new oracle,
72.534	and it's name is big data,
74.703	"or we call it ""Watson"""
74.703	"or ""deep learning"" or ""neural net."""
79.16	And these are the kinds of questions
79.16	we ask of our oracle now,
83.196	"like, ""What's the most efficient way"
83.196	to ship these phones
87.142	"from China to Sweden?"""
88.989	"Or, ""What are the odds"
90.813	of my child being born
90.813	"with a genetic disorder?"""
94.772	"Or, ""What are the sales volume"
94.772	"we can predict for this product?"""
99.928	I have a dog. Her name is Elle,
99.928	and she hates the rain.
103.999	And I have tried everything
103.999	to untrain her.
107.329	But because I have failed at this,
110.124	I also have to consult
110.124	an oracle, called Dark Sky,
113.434	every time before we go on a walk,
115.093	for very accurate weather predictions
115.093	in the next 10 minutes.
121.355	She's so sweet.
123.647	So because of all of this,
123.647	our oracle is a $122 billion industry.
129.826	Now, despite the size of this industry,
133.226	the returns are surprisingly low.
136.162	Investing in big data is easy,
138.68	but using it is hard.
141.801	Over 73 percent of big data projects
141.801	aren't even profitable,
145.865	and I have executives
145.865	coming up to me saying,
148.32	"""We're experiencing the same thing."
150.133	We invested in some big data system,
151.91	and our employees aren't making
151.91	better decisions.
154.902	And they're certainly not coming up
154.902	"with more breakthrough ideas."""
158.734	So this is all really interesting to me,
161.942	because I'm a technology ethnographer.
164.45	I study and I advise companies
167.038	on the patterns
167.038	of how people use technology,
169.545	and one of my interest areas is data.
172.247	So why is having more data
172.247	not helping us make better decisions,
177.464	especially for companies
177.464	who have all these resources
180.271	to invest in these big data systems?
182.031	Why isn't it getting any easier for them?
185.81	So, I've witnessed the struggle firsthand.
189.194	In 2009, I started
189.194	a research position with Nokia.
193.052	And at the time,
194.234	Nokia was one of the largest
194.234	cell phone companies in the world,
197.416	dominating emerging markets
197.416	like China, Mexico and India --
200.642	all places where I had done
200.642	a lot of research
203.168	on how low-income people use technology.
205.868	And I spent a lot of extra time in China
208.222	getting to know the informal economy.
210.838	So I did things like working
210.838	as a street vendor
213.263	selling dumplings to construction workers.
215.861	Or I did fieldwork,
217.243	spending nights and days
217.243	in internet caf√©s,
220.225	hanging out with Chinese youth,
220.225	so I could understand
222.795	how they were using
222.795	games and mobile phones
225.103	and using it between moving
225.103	from the rural areas to the cities.
230.155	Through all of this qualitative evidence
230.155	that I was gathering,
234.106	I was starting to see so clearly
236.954	that a big change was about to happen
236.954	among low-income Chinese people.
242.84	Even though they were surrounded
242.84	by advertisements for luxury products
247.231	like fancy toilets --
247.231	who wouldn't want one? --
250.75	and apartments and cars,
253.664	through my conversations with them,
255.508	I found out that the ads
255.508	the actually enticed them the most
259.373	were the ones for iPhones,
261.393	promising them this entry
261.393	into this high-tech life.
265.289	And even when I was living with them
265.289	in urban slums like this one,
268.476	I saw people investing
268.476	over half of their monthly income
271.496	into buying a phone,
273.143	"and increasingly, they were ""shanzhai,"""
275.469	which are affordable knock-offs
275.469	of iPhones and other brands.
280.123	They're very usable.
282.71	Does the job.
284.57	And after years of living
284.57	with migrants and working with them
290.383	and just really doing everything
290.383	that they were doing,
293.841	I started piecing
293.841	all these data points together --
297.462	from the things that seem random,
297.462	like me selling dumplings,
300.609	to the things that were more obvious,
302.437	like tracking how much they were spending
302.437	on their cell phone bills.
305.693	And I was able to create
305.693	this much more holistic picture
308.356	of what was happening.
309.536	And that's when I started to realize
311.282	that even the poorest in China
311.282	would want a smartphone,
314.815	and that they would do almost anything
314.815	to get their hands on one.
320.893	You have to keep in mind,
323.321	iPhones had just come out, it was 2009,
326.429	so this was, like, eight years ago,
328.338	and Androids had just started
328.338	looking like iPhones.
330.799	And a lot of very smart
330.799	and realistic people said,
333.33	"""Those smartphones -- that's just a fad."
336.063	Who wants to carry around
336.063	these heavy things
339.083	where batteries drain quickly
339.083	"and they break every time you drop them?"""
344.613	But I had a lot of data,
345.838	and I was very confident
345.838	about my insights,
348.122	so I was very excited
348.122	to share them with Nokia.
353.152	But Nokia was not convinced,
355.693	because it wasn't big data.
358.842	"They said, ""We have"
358.842	millions of data points,
361.27	and we don't see any indicators
361.27	of anyone wanting to buy a smartphone,
365.541	and your data set of 100,
365.541	as diverse as it is, is too weak
369.953	"for us to even take seriously."""
372.728	"And I said, ""Nokia, you're right."
374.357	Of course you wouldn't see this,
375.941	because you're sending out surveys
375.941	assuming that people don't know
379.336	what a smartphone is,
380.519	so of course you're not going
380.519	to get any data back
382.909	about people wanting to buy
382.909	a smartphone in two years.
385.505	Your surveys, your methods
385.505	have been designed
387.647	to optimize an existing business model,
389.693	and I'm looking
389.693	at these emergent human dynamics
392.325	that haven't happened yet.
393.703	We're looking outside of market dynamics
396.165	"so that we can get ahead of it."""
399.193	Well, you know what happened to Nokia?
401.461	Their business fell off a cliff.
404.611	This -- this is the cost
404.611	of missing something.
408.983	It was unfathomable.
411.823	But Nokia's not alone.
414.078	I see organizations
414.078	throwing out data all the time
416.683	because it didn't come from a quant model
419.268	or it doesn't fit in one.
422.039	But it's not big data's fault.
424.762	It's the way we use big data;
424.762	it's our responsibility.
429.55	Big data's reputation for success
431.485	comes from quantifying
431.485	very specific environments,
435.268	like electricity power grids
435.268	or delivery logistics or genetic code,
440.205	when we're quantifying in systems
440.205	that are more or less contained.
444.547	But not all systems
444.547	are as neatly contained.
447.54	When you're quantifying
447.54	and systems are more dynamic,
450.822	especially systems
450.822	that involve human beings,
454.645	forces are complex and unpredictable,
457.095	and these are things
457.095	that we don't know how to model so well.
461.024	Once you predict something
461.024	about human behavior,
463.861	new factors emerge,
465.74	because conditions
465.74	are constantly changing.
468.129	That's why it's a never-ending cycle.
469.956	You think you know something,
471.444	and then something unknown
471.444	enters the picture.
473.71	And that's why just relying
473.71	on big data alone
477.056	increases the chance
477.056	that we'll miss something,
479.929	while giving us this illusion
479.929	that we already know everything.
484.226	And what makes it really hard
484.226	to see this paradox
488.106	and even wrap our brains around it
490.789	is that we have this thing
490.789	that I call the quantification bias,
494.504	which is the unconscious belief
494.504	of valuing the measurable
498.45	over the immeasurable.
501.042	And we often experience this at our work.
504.35	Maybe we work alongside
504.35	colleagues who are like this,
507.024	or even our whole entire
507.024	company may be like this,
509.476	where people become
509.476	so fixated on that number,
512.046	that they can't see anything
512.046	outside of it,
514.137	even when you present them evidence
514.137	right in front of their face.
518.943	And this is a very appealing message,
522.338	because there's nothing
522.338	wrong with quantifying;
524.705	it's actually very satisfying.
526.159	I get a great sense of comfort
526.159	from looking at an Excel spreadsheet,
530.545	even very simple ones.
531.97	(Laughter)
533.008	It's just kind of like,
534.184	"""Yes! The formula worked. It's all OK."
534.184	"Everything is under control."""
538.612	But the problem is
541.026	that quantifying is addictive.
543.711	And when we forget that
545.117	and when we don't have something
545.117	to kind of keep that in check,
548.179	it's very easy to just throw out data
550.321	because it can't be expressed
550.321	as a numerical value.
553.063	It's very easy just to slip
553.063	into silver-bullet thinking,
556.008	as if some simple solution existed.
559.42	Because this is a great moment of danger
559.42	for any organization,
563.506	because oftentimes,
563.506	the future we need to predict --
566.164	it isn't in that haystack,
568.354	but it's that tornado
568.354	that's bearing down on us
570.916	outside of the barn.
574.78	There is no greater risk
577.13	than being blind to the unknown.
578.82	It can cause you to make
578.82	the wrong decisions.
580.993	It can cause you to miss something big.
583.554	But we don't have to go down this path.
587.273	It turns out that the oracle
587.273	of ancient Greece
590.492	holds the secret key
590.492	that shows us the path forward.
595.474	Now, recent geological research has shown
598.093	that the Temple of Apollo,
598.093	where the most famous oracle sat,
601.681	was actually built
601.681	over two earthquake faults.
604.789	And these faults would release
604.789	these petrochemical fumes
607.699	from underneath the Earth's crust,
609.408	and the oracle literally sat
609.408	right above these faults,
613.298	inhaling enormous amounts
613.298	of ethylene gas, these fissures.
616.91	(Laughter)
617.942	It's true.
619.139	(Laughter)
620.18	It's all true, and that's what made her
620.18	babble and hallucinate
623.713	and go into this trance-like state.
625.461	She was high as a kite!
627.255	(Laughter)
631.74	So how did anyone --
634.543	How did anyone get
634.543	any useful advice out of her
637.597	in this state?
639.317	Well, you see those people
639.317	surrounding the oracle?
641.722	You see those people holding her up,
643.625	because she's, like, a little woozy?
645.366	And you see that guy
645.366	on your left-hand side
647.698	holding the orange notebook?
649.925	Well, those were the temple guides,
651.679	and they worked hand in hand
651.679	with the oracle.
655.904	When inquisitors would come
655.904	and get on their knees,
658.444	that's when the temple guides
658.444	would get to work,
660.808	because after they asked her questions,
662.696	they would observe their emotional state,
664.721	and then they would ask them
664.721	follow-up questions,
667.069	"like, ""Why do you want to know"
667.069	this prophecy? Who are you?
669.927	What are you going to do
669.927	"with this information?"""
672.215	And then the temple guides would take
672.215	this more ethnographic,
675.421	this more qualitative information,
677.601	and interpret the oracle's babblings.
681.248	So the oracle didn't stand alone,
683.564	and neither should our big data systems.
686.45	Now to be clear,
687.635	I'm not saying that big data systems
687.635	are huffing ethylene gas,
691.118	or that they're even giving
691.118	invalid predictions.
693.495	The total opposite.
694.68	But what I am saying
696.772	is that in the same way
696.772	that the oracle needed her temple guides,
700.628	our big data systems need them, too.
702.94	They need people like ethnographers
702.94	and user researchers
707.073	who can gather what I call thick data.
710.322	This is precious data from humans,
713.337	like stories, emotions and interactions
713.337	that cannot be quantified.
717.463	It's the kind of data
717.463	that I collected for Nokia
719.809	that comes in in the form
719.809	of a very small sample size,
722.502	but delivers incredible depth of meaning.
725.481	And what makes it so thick and meaty
730.265	is the experience of understanding
730.265	the human narrative.
734.318	And that's what helps to see
734.318	what's missing in our models.
738.671	Thick data grounds our business questions
738.671	in human questions,
742.74	and that's why integrating
742.74	big and thick data
746.326	forms a more complete picture.
748.592	Big data is able to offer
748.592	insights at scale
751.497	and leverage the best
751.497	of machine intelligence,
754.168	whereas thick data can help us
754.168	rescue the context loss
757.764	that comes from making big data usable,
759.886	and leverage the best
759.886	of human intelligence.
762.091	And when you actually integrate the two,
762.091	that's when things get really fun,
765.667	because then you're no longer
765.667	just working with data
768.127	you've already collected.
769.347	You get to also work with data
769.347	that hasn't been collected.
772.108	You get to ask questions about why:
773.851	Why is this happening?
775.598	Now, when Netflix did this,
777.001	they unlocked a whole new way
777.001	to transform their business.
781.226	Netflix is known for their really great
781.226	recommendation algorithm,
785.206	and they had this $1 million prize
785.206	for anyone who could improve it.
790.027	And there were winners.
792.075	But Netflix discovered
792.075	the improvements were only incremental.
797.224	So to really find out what was going on,
799.212	they hired an ethnographer,
799.212	Grant McCracken,
802.977	to gather thick data insights.
804.547	And what he discovered was something
804.547	that they hadn't seen initially
808.495	in the quantitative data.
810.892	He discovered that people loved
810.892	to binge-watch.
813.644	In fact, people didn't even
813.644	feel guilty about it.
816.021	They enjoyed it.
817.3	(Laughter)
818.35	So Netflix was like,
818.35	"""Oh. This is a new insight."""
820.73	So they went to their data science team,
822.692	and they were able to scale
822.692	this big data insight
825.034	in with their quantitative data.
827.645	And once they verified it
827.645	and validated it,
830.839	Netflix decided to do something
830.839	very simple but impactful.
836.654	They said, instead of offering
836.654	the same show from different genres
843.17	or more of the different shows
843.17	from similar users,
847.082	we'll just offer more of the same show.
849.66	We'll make it easier
849.66	for you to binge-watch.
851.789	And they didn't stop there.
853.299	They did all these things
854.797	to redesign their entire
854.797	viewer experience,
857.78	to really encourage binge-watching.
860.05	It's why people and friends disappear
860.05	for whole weekends at a time,
863.315	catching up on shows
863.315	"like ""Master of None."""
865.682	By integrating big data and thick data,
865.682	they not only improved their business,
869.879	but they transformed how we consume media.
872.715	And now their stocks are projected
872.715	to double in the next few years.
878.1	But this isn't just about
878.1	watching more videos
881.954	or selling more smartphones.
883.963	For some, integrating thick data
883.963	insights into the algorithm
888.037	could mean life or death,
890.324	especially for the marginalized.
893.558	All around the country,
893.558	police departments are using big data
897.016	for predictive policing,
899.003	to set bond amounts
899.003	and sentencing recommendations
902.111	in ways that reinforce existing biases.
906.116	NSA's Skynet machine learning algorithm
908.563	has possibly aided in the deaths
908.563	of thousands of civilians in Pakistan
914.031	from misreading cellular device metadata.
918.951	As all of our lives become more automated,
922.378	from automobiles to health insurance
922.378	or to employment,
925.482	it is likely that all of us
927.856	will be impacted
927.856	by the quantification bias.
932.792	Now, the good news
932.792	is that we've come a long way
935.437	from huffing ethylene gas
935.437	to make predictions.
937.911	We have better tools,
937.911	so let's just use them better.
941.005	Let's integrate the big data
941.005	with the thick data.
943.352	Let's bring our temple guides
943.352	with the oracles,
945.637	and whether this work happens
945.637	in companies or nonprofits
949.037	or government or even in the software,
951.53	all of it matters,
953.346	because that means
953.346	we're collectively committed
956.393	to making better data,
958.608	better algorithms, better outputs
960.468	and better decisions.
962.135	This is how we'll avoid
962.135	missing that something.
