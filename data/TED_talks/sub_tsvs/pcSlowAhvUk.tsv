12.855	There is an entire genre of YouTube videos
15.798	devoted to an experience which
17.811	I am certain that everyone in this room has had.
20.388	It entails an individual who,
22.401	thinking they're alone,
23.964	engages in some expressive behavior —
27.17	wild singing, gyrating dancing,
29.677	some mild sexual activity —
32.28	only to discover that, in fact, they are not alone,
34.878	that there is a person watching and lurking,
37.923	the discovery of which causes them
39.678	to immediately cease what they were doing
41.578	in horror.
43.468	The sense of shame and humiliation
45.55	in their face is palpable.
47.833	It's the sense of,
49.565	"""This is something I'm willing to do"
51.298	"only if no one else is watching."""
54.898	This is the crux of the work
57.316	on which I have been singularly focused
59.363	for the last 16 months,
61.238	the question of why privacy matters,
63.3	a question that has arisen
65.238	in the context of a global debate,
68.36	enabled by the revelations of Edward Snowden
70.848	that the United States and its partners,
73.189	unbeknownst to the entire world,
75.211	has converted the Internet,
77.303	once heralded as an unprecedented tool
80.104	of liberation and democratization,
83.42	into an unprecedented zone
85.189	of mass, indiscriminate surveillance.
89.283	There is a very common sentiment
91.24	that arises in this debate,
92.726	even among people who are uncomfortable
94.683	with mass surveillance, which says
96.737	that there is no real harm
98.66	that comes from this large-scale invasion
101.405	because only people who are engaged in bad acts
104.679	have a reason to want to hide
106.748	and to care about their privacy.
109.459	This worldview is implicitly grounded
112.24	in the proposition that there are
112.24	two kinds of people in the world,
114.416	good people and bad people.
116.452	Bad people are those who plot terrorist attacks
119.42	or who engage in violent criminality
120.918	and therefore have reasons to
120.918	want to hide what they're doing,
124.07	have reasons to care about their privacy.
126.127	But by contrast, good people
128.95	are people who go to work,
130.603	come home, raise their children, watch television.
133.505	They use the Internet not to plot bombing attacks
136.261	but to read the news or exchange recipes
138.736	or to plan their kids' Little League games,
141.21	and those people are doing nothing wrong
143.528	and therefore have nothing to hide
145.575	and no reason to fear
147.937	the government monitoring them.
150.379	The people who are actually saying that
152.189	are engaged in a very extreme act
154.968	of self-deprecation.
156.524	What they're really saying is,
158.433	"""I have agreed to make myself"
160.626	such a harmless and unthreatening
163.472	and uninteresting person that I actually don't fear
166.43	"having the government know what it is that I'm doing."""
169.779	This mindset has found what I think
171.583	is its purest expression
173.652	in a 2009 interview with
175.959	the longtime CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt, who,
178.894	when asked about all the different ways his company
181.436	is causing invasions of privacy
183.608	for hundreds of millions of people around the world,
186.217	said this: He said,
188.208	"""If you're doing something that you don't want"
189.884	other people to know,
191.898	"maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place."""
195.903	Now, there's all kinds of things to say about
197.888	that mentality,
200.233	the first of which is that the people who say that,
203.473	who say that privacy isn't really important,
205.588	they don't actually believe it,
208.535	and the way you know that
208.535	they don't actually believe it
210.357	is that while they say with their
210.357	words that privacy doesn't matter,
213.226	with their actions, they take all kinds of steps
216.387	to safeguard their privacy.
219.154	They put passwords on their email
220.972	and their social media accounts,
222.742	they put locks on their bedroom
224.621	and bathroom doors,
225.97	all steps designed to prevent other people
228.67	from entering what they consider their private realm
231.572	and knowing what it is that they
231.572	don't want other people to know.
235.273	The very same Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google,
238.333	ordered his employees at Google
240.942	to cease speaking with the online
242.877	Internet magazine CNET
245.15	after CNET published an article
247.74	full of personal, private information
249.773	about Eric Schmidt,
251.854	which it obtained exclusively
251.854	through Google searches
254.97	and using other Google products. (Laughter)
258.311	This same division can be seen
260.168	with the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg,
262.63	who in an infamous interview in 2010
266.16	pronounced that privacy is no longer
268.559	"a ""social norm."""
271.584	Last year, Mark Zuckerberg and his new wife
274.14	purchased not only their own house
276.445	but also all four adjacent houses in Palo Alto
280.32	for a total of 30 million dollars
281.934	in order to ensure that they enjoyed a zone of privacy
285.466	that prevented other people from monitoring
287.592	what they do in their personal lives.
291.191	Over the last 16 months, as I've
291.191	debated this issue around the world,
293.944	every single time somebody has said to me,
296.36	"""I don't really worry about invasions of privacy"
297.869	"because I don't have anything to hide."""
299.478	I always say the same thing to them.
301.178	I get out a pen, I write down my email address.
303.471	"I say, ""Here's my email address."
305.113	What I want you to do when you get home
306.812	is email me the passwords
308.522	to all of your email accounts,
310.332	not just the nice, respectable work one in your name,
312.886	but all of them,
314.436	because I want to be able to just troll through
316.497	what it is you're doing online,
318.176	read what I want to read and
318.176	publish whatever I find interesting.
320.738	After all, if you're not a bad person,
322.538	if you're doing nothing wrong,
324.36	"you should have nothing to hide."""
327.34	Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.
330.873	I check and — (Applause)
334.878	I check that email account religiously all the time.
338.118	It's a very desolate place.
341.323	And there's a reason for that,
343.11	which is that we as human beings,
345.151	even those of us who in words
347.105	disclaim the importance of our own privacy,
349.546	instinctively understand
351.683	the profound importance of it.
353.877	It is true that as human beings, we're social animals,
356.704	which means we have a need for other people
358.853	to know what we're doing and saying and thinking,
361.597	which is why we voluntarily publish
361.597	information about ourselves online.
365.867	But equally essential to what it means
368.713	to be a free and fulfilled human being
371.294	is to have a place that we can go
373.431	and be free of the judgmental eyes of other people.
377.459	There's a reason why we seek that out,
379.466	and our reason is that all of us —
382.376	not just terrorists and criminals, all of us —
385.704	have things to hide.
387.749	There are all sorts of things that we do and think
390.496	that we're willing to tell our physician
393.197	or our lawyer or our psychologist or our spouse
396.952	or our best friend that we would be mortified
399.29	for the rest of the world to learn.
401.25	We make judgments every single day
403.452	about the kinds of things that we say and think and do
405.91	that we're willing to have other people know,
407.631	and the kinds of things that we say and think and do
409.621	that we don't want anyone else to know about.
411.95	People can very easily in words claim
415.277	that they don't value their privacy,
417.439	but their actions negate the authenticity of that belief.
422.416	Now, there's a reason why privacy is so craved
426.146	universally and instinctively.
427.89	It isn't just a reflexive movement
429.777	like breathing air or drinking water.
432.491	The reason is that when we're in a state
434.931	where we can be monitored,
434.931	where we can be watched,
437.588	our behavior changes dramatically.
440.264	The range of behavioral options that we consider
443.297	when we think we're being watched
445.105	severely reduce.
447.26	This is just a fact of human nature
449.475	that has been recognized in social science
451.763	and in literature and in religion
453.67	and in virtually every field of discipline.
455.898	There are dozens of psychological studies
458.68	that prove that when somebody knows
461.231	that they might be watched,
462.8	the behavior they engage in
464.492	is vastly more conformist and compliant.
467.974	Human shame is a very powerful motivator,
471.319	as is the desire to avoid it,
474.23	and that's the reason why people,
475.729	when they're in a state of
475.729	being watched, make decisions
477.968	not that are the byproduct of their own agency
481.23	but that are about the expectations
483.242	that others have of them
484.694	or the mandates of societal orthodoxy.
489.128	This realization was exploited most powerfully
491.995	for pragmatic ends by the 18th-
491.995	century philosopher Jeremy Bentham,
496.136	who set out to resolve an important problem
498.487	ushered in by the industrial age,
500.289	where, for the first time, institutions had become
502.647	so large and centralized
504.644	that they were no longer able to monitor
506.472	and therefore control each one
506.472	of their individual members,
509.425	and the solution that he devised
511.306	was an architectural design
513.509	originally intended to be implemented in prisons
516.225	that he called the panopticon,
518.544	the primary attribute of which was the construction
520.904	of an enormous tower in the center of the institution
523.975	where whoever controlled the institution
526.123	could at any moment watch any of the inmates,
528.808	although they couldn't watch all of them at all times.
532.13	And crucial to this design
534.185	was that the inmates could not actually
535.98	see into the panopticon, into the tower,
538.856	and so they never knew
540.528	if they were being watched or even when.
542.7	And what made him so excited about this discovery
546.283	was that that would mean that the prisoners
548.156	would have to assume that they were being watched
551.184	at any given moment,
552.869	which would be the ultimate enforcer
554.747	for obedience and compliance.
558.425	The 20th-century French philosopher Michel Foucault
561.35	realized that that model could be used
563.275	not just for prisons but for every institution
566.39	that seeks to control human behavior:
568.34	schools, hospitals, factories, workplaces.
571.215	And what he said was that this mindset,
573.413	this framework discovered by Bentham,
575.839	was the key means of societal control
579.168	for modern, Western societies,
581.17	which no longer need
582.944	the overt weapons of tyranny —
584.851	punishing or imprisoning or killing dissidents,
587.247	or legally compelling loyalty to a particular party —
590.561	because mass surveillance creates
592.96	a prison in the mind
595.515	that is a much more subtle
597.358	though much more effective means
599.247	of fostering compliance with social norms
602.296	or with social orthodoxy,
603.758	much more effective
605.32	than brute force could ever be.
608.445	The most iconic work of literature about surveillance
611.263	"and privacy is the George Orwell novel ""1984,"""
614.813	which we all learn in school, and
614.813	therefore it's almost become a cliche.
618.28	In fact, whenever you bring it up
618.28	in a debate about surveillance,
620.349	people instantaneously dismiss it
622.598	as inapplicable, and what they say is,
624.9	"""Oh, well in '1984,' there were"
624.9	monitors in people's homes,
628.183	they were being watched at every given moment,
630.348	and that has nothing to do with
630.348	"the surveillance state that we face."""
634.31	That is an actual fundamental misapprehension
637.23	"of the warnings that Orwell issued in ""1984."""
639.931	The warning that he was issuing
641.582	was about a surveillance state
643.19	not that monitored everybody at all times,
645.354	but where people were aware that they could
647.407	be monitored at any given moment.
649.036	Here is how Orwell's narrator, Winston Smith,
652.11	described the surveillance system
654.15	that they faced:
655.548	"""There was, of course, no way of knowing"
657.975	whether you were being watched
657.975	"at any given moment."""
660.292	He went on to say,
661.743	"""At any rate, they could plug in your wire"
663.454	whenever they wanted to.
665.163	You had to live, did live,
667.742	from habit that became instinct,
669.995	in the assumption that every sound you made
672.49	was overheard and except in darkness
674.68	"every movement scrutinized."""
677.419	The Abrahamic religions similarly posit
680.765	that there's an invisible, all-knowing authority
683.708	who, because of its omniscience,
685.451	always watches whatever you're doing,
687.347	which means you never have a private moment,
690.12	the ultimate enforcer
691.804	for obedience to its dictates.
694.794	What all of these seemingly disparate works
698.198	recognize, the conclusion that they all reach,
700.984	is that a society in which people
703.306	can be monitored at all times
705.613	is a society that breeds conformity
708.268	and obedience and submission,
710.51	which is why every tyrant,
712.021	the most overt to the most subtle,
714.103	craves that system.
716.366	Conversely, even more importantly,
719.02	it is a realm of privacy,
721.46	the ability to go somewhere where we can think
724.47	and reason and interact and speak
727.628	without the judgmental eyes
727.628	of others being cast upon us,
731.282	in which creativity and exploration
734.825	and dissent exclusively reside,
737.853	and that is the reason why,
739.674	when we allow a society to exist
742.25	in which we're subject to constant monitoring,
744.413	we allow the essence of human freedom
747.39	to be severely crippled.
750.341	The last point I want to observe about this mindset,
753.463	the idea that only people who 
753.463	are doing something wrong
755.388	have things to hide and therefore
755.388	reasons to care about privacy,
759.27	is that it entrenches two very destructive messages,
763.276	two destructive lessons,
765.304	the first of which is that
767.06	the only people who care about privacy,
769.18	the only people who will seek out privacy,
771.236	are by definition bad people.
775.311	This is a conclusion that we should have
777.443	all kinds of reasons for avoiding,
779.971	the most important of which is that when you say,
782.723	"""somebody who is doing bad things,"""
785.1	you probably mean things
785.1	like plotting a terrorist attack
787.937	or engaging in violent criminality,
789.978	a much narrower conception
792.518	of what people who wield power mean
794.97	"when they say, ""doing bad things."""
797.02	"For them, ""doing bad things"" typically means"
799.327	doing something that poses meaningful challenges
802.398	to the exercise of our own power.
805.503	The other really destructive
807.453	and, I think, even more insidious lesson
809.361	that comes from accepting this mindset
812.14	is there's an implicit bargain
814.906	that people who accept this mindset have accepted,
818.25	and that bargain is this:
819.705	If you're willing to render yourself
821.677	sufficiently harmless,
823.779	sufficiently unthreatening
825.949	to those who wield political power,
827.831	then and only then can you be free
830.867	of the dangers of surveillance.
832.975	It's only those who are dissidents,
835.36	who challenge power,
836.841	who have something to worry about.
838.653	There are all kinds of reasons why we
838.653	should want to avoid that lesson as well.
842.06	You may be a person who, right now,
844.298	doesn't want to engage in that behavior,
846.37	but at some point in the future you might.
848.825	Even if you're somebody who decides
850.499	that you never want to,
852.264	the fact that there are other people
853.898	who are willing to and able to resist
856.102	and be adversarial to those in power —
858.136	dissidents and journalists
859.67	and activists and a whole range of others —
861.758	is something that brings us all collective good
864.252	that we should want to preserve.
867.23	Equally critical is that the measure
869.324	of how free a society is
871.587	is not how it treats its good,
873.737	obedient, compliant citizens,
876.2	but how it treats its dissidents
878.04	and those who resist orthodoxy.
881.155	But the most important reason
882.752	is that a system of mass surveillance
885.153	suppresses our own freedom in all sorts of ways.
887.77	It renders off-limits
889.571	all kinds of behavioral choices
891.577	without our even knowing that it's happened.
895.13	The renowned socialist activist Rosa Luxemburg
897.612	"once said, ""He who does not move"
900.105	"does not notice his chains."""
903.461	We can try and render the chains
905.15	of mass surveillance invisible or undetectable,
908.239	but the constraints that it imposes on us
910.905	do not become any less potent.
913.45	Thank you very much.
915.058	(Applause)
916.489	Thank you.
917.996	(Applause)
922.893	Thank you.
925.28	(Applause)
931.32	Bruno Giussani: Glenn, thank you.
933.612	The case is rather convincing, I have to say,
935.901	but I want to bring you back
937.466	to the last 16 months and to Edward Snowden
940.817	for a few questions, if you don't mind.
942.882	The first one is personal to you.
945.37	We have all read about the arrest of your partner,
948.411	David Miranda in London, and other difficulties,
951.721	but I assume that
953.805	in terms of personal engagement and risk,
957.161	that the pressure on you is not that easy
958.965	to take on the biggest sovereign 
958.965	organizations in the world.
961.91	Tell us a little bit about that.
964.345	Glenn Greenwald: You know, I think
964.345	one of the things that happens
966	is that people's courage in this regard
967.932	gets contagious,
969.644	and so although I and the other
969.644	journalists with whom I was working
973.107	were certainly aware of the risk —
974.643	the United States continues to be
974.643	the most powerful country in the world
977.365	and doesn't appreciate it when you
979.363	disclose thousands of their secrets
981.285	on the Internet at will —
983.796	seeing somebody who is a 29-year-old
987.265	ordinary person who grew up in
989.284	a very ordinary environment
991.597	exercise the degree of principled
991.597	courage that Edward Snowden risked,
995.32	knowing that he was going to go
995.32	to prison for the rest of his life
997.54	or that his life would unravel,
999.322	inspired me and inspired other journalists
1001.297	and inspired, I think, people around the world,
1003.12	including future whistleblowers,
1004.808	to realize that they can engage
1004.808	in that kind of behavior as well.
1008.323	BG: I'm curious about your
1008.323	relationship with Ed Snowden,
1010.809	because you have spoken with him a lot,
1013.99	and you certainly continue doing so,
1015.753	but in your book, you never call him Edward,
1018.389	"nor Ed, you say ""Snowden."" How come?"
1021.849	GG: You know, I'm sure that's something
1023.493	for a team of psychologists to examine.
1023.493	(Laughter)
1026.824	I don't really know. The reason I think that,
1030.413	one of the important objectives that he actually had,
1033.967	one of his, I think, most important tactics,
1036.303	was that he knew that one of the ways
1038.51	to distract attention from the
1038.51	substance of the revelations
1041.2	would be to try and personalize the focus on him,
1043.85	and for that reason, he stayed out of the media.
1045.917	He tried not to ever have his personal life
1048.426	subject to examination,
1050.105	and so I think calling him Snowden
1052.819	is a way of just identifying him
1052.819	as this important historical actor
1056.393	rather than trying to personalize him in a way
1058.265	that might distract attention from the substance.
1061.145	Moderator: So his revelations, your analysis,
1062.602	the work of other journalists,
1064.378	have really developed the debate,
1067.378	and many governments, for example, have reacted,
1069.506	including in Brazil, with projects and programs
1072.11	to reshape a little bit the design of the Internet, etc.
1074.964	There are a lot of things going on in that sense.
1077.716	But I'm wondering, for you personally,
1079.986	what is the endgame?
1081.637	At what point will you think,
1083.27	well, actually, we've succeeded 
1083.27	in moving the dial?
1086.462	GG: Well, I mean, the endgame for me as a journalist
1088.74	is very simple, which is to make sure
1091.183	that every single document that's newsworthy
1093.195	and that ought to be disclosed
1094.841	ends up being disclosed,
1096.321	and that secrets that should never
1096.321	have been kept in the first place
1098.358	end up uncovered.
1099.833	To me, that's the essence of journalism
1101.68	and that's what I'm committed to doing.
1103.207	As somebody who finds mass surveillance odious
1105.681	for all the reasons I just talked about and a lot more,
1107.868	I mean, I look at this as work that will never end
1110.394	until governments around the world
1112.571	are no longer able to subject entire populations
1115.19	to monitoring and surveillance
1116.676	unless they convince some court or some entity
1119.265	that the person they've targeted
1120.987	has actually done something wrong.
1123.578	To me, that's the way that
1123.578	privacy can be rejuvenated.
1126.813	BG: So Snowden is very,
1126.813	as we've seen at TED,
1129.159	is very articulate in presenting and portraying himself
1131.927	as a defender of democratic values
1134.207	and democratic principles.
1135.92	But then, many people really 
1135.92	find it difficult to believe
1138.948	that those are his only motivations.
1141.35	They find it difficult to believe
1142.828	that there was no money involved,
1144.449	that he didn't sell some of those secrets,
1146.36	even to China and to Russia,
1148.189	which are clearly not the best friends
1150.733	of the United States right now.
1152.902	And I'm sure many people in the room
1154.608	are wondering the same question.
1156.878	Do you consider it possible there is
1158.761	that part of Snowden we've not seen yet?
1161.373	GG: No, I consider that absurd and idiotic.
1164.554	(Laughter) If you wanted to,
1166.968	and I know you're just playing devil's advocate,
1169.43	but if you wanted to sell
1172.641	secrets to another country,
1174.547	which he could have done and become
1176.264	extremely rich doing so,
1177.91	the last thing you would 
1177.91	do is take those secrets
1179.891	and give them to journalists and
1179.891	ask journalists to publish them,
1182.635	because it makes those secrets worthless.
1184.661	People who want to enrich themselves
1186.309	do it secretly by selling 
1186.309	secrets to the government,
1188.279	but I think there's one important point worth making,
1190.1	which is, that accusation comes from
1192.338	people in the U.S. government,
1194.17	from people in the media who are loyalists
1196.19	to these various governments,
1197.788	and I think a lot of times when people make accusations like that about other people —
1200.936	"""Oh, he can't really be doing this"
1202.541	for principled reasons,
1204.206	"he must have some corrupt, nefarious reason"" —"
1206.448	they're saying a lot more about themselves
1208.555	than they are the target of their accusations,
1210.381	because — (Applause) —
1214.766	those people, the ones who make that accusation,
1217.286	they themselves never act
1219.19	for any reason other than corrupt reasons,
1221.112	so they assume
1222.744	that everybody else is plagued by the same disease
1225.376	of soullessness as they are,
1227.378	and so that's the assumption.
1229.249	(Applause)
1230.876	BG: Glenn, thank you very much.
1230.876	GG: Thank you very much.
1233.36	BG: Glenn Greenwald.
1235.692	(Applause)
