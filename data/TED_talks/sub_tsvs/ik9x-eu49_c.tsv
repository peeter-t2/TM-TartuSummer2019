25	I was asked to come here and speak about creation.
28	And I only have 15 minutes, and I see they're counting already.
32	And I can -- in 15 minutes, I think I can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of creation,
39	"which I call ""creativity."""
42	Creativity is how we cope with creation.
46	While creation sometimes seems a bit un-graspable, or even pointless,
52	creativity is always meaningful.
55	See, for instance, in this picture.
56	You know, creation is what put that dog in that picture,
60	and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters.
65	When you think about -- you know, creativity has a lot to do with causality too.
71	You know, when I was a teenager, I was a creator.
74	I just did things.
77	Then I became an adult and started knowing who I was,
79	and tried to maintain that persona -- I became creative.
83	It wasn't until I actually did a book and a retrospective exhibition, that I could track exactly --
91	looks like all the craziest things that I had done, all my drinking, all my parties --
95	they followed a straight line that brings me to the point
97	that actually I'm talking to you at this moment.
99	Though it's actually true, you know,
103	the reason I'm talking to you right now is because I was born in Brazil.
106	If I was born in Monterey, probably would be in Brazil.
112	You know, I was born in Brazil and grew up in the '70s
114	under a climate of political distress,
118	and I was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way --
121	in a sort of a semiotic black market.
123	You couldn't really say what you wanted to say;
126	you had to invent ways of doing it.
128	You didn't trust information very much.
130	That led me to another step of why I'm here today,
133	is because I really liked media of all kinds.
136	I was a media junkie, and eventually got involved with advertising.
140	My first job in Brazil
142	was actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboards,
147	and based on speed, angle of approach and actually blocks of text.
151	It was very -- actually, it was a very good study,
154	and got me a job in an ad agency.
156	And they also decided that I had to --
159	to give me a very ugly Plexiglas trophy for it.
164	And another point -- why I'm here --
166	is that the day I went to pick up the Plexiglas trophy,
170	I rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life,
173	picked the thing -- didn't have any friends.
175	On my way out, I had to break a fight apart.
178	Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles.
181	They were in tuxedos, and fighting. It was very ugly.
183	And also -- advertising people do that all the time -- (Laughter) --
189	and I -- well, what happened is when I went back, it was on the way back to my car,
194	the guy who got hit decided to grab a gun --
196	I don't know why he had a gun --
198	and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor.
200	The first person was wearing a black tie, a tuxedo. It was me.
206	Luckily, it wasn't fatal, as you can all see.
209	And, even more luckily, the guy said that he was sorry
214	and I bribed him for compensation money, otherwise I press charges.
218	And that's how -- with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in 1983,
224	and that's very -- the basic reason I'm talking to you here today:
228	because I got shot. (Laughter) (Applause)
231	Well, when I started working with my own work, I decided that I shouldn't do images.
239	You know, I became -- I took this very iconoclastic approach.
243	Because when I decided to go into advertising, I wanted to do --
246	I wanted to airbrush naked people on ice, for whiskey commercials,
252	that's what I really wanted to do. (Laughter)
253	But I -- they didn't let me do it, so I just -- you know,
256	they would only let me do other things.
258	But I wasn't into selling whiskey; I was into selling ice.
262	The first works were actually objects.
264	It was kind of a mixture of found object, product design and advertising.
269	And I called them relics.
271	They were displayed first at Stux Gallery in 1983.
275	This is the clown skull.
277	Is a remnant of a race of -- a very evolved race of entertainers.
280	They lived in Brazil, long time ago. (Laughter)
284	This is the Ashanti joystick.
286	Unfortunately, it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform.
291	A Playstation II is in the works, maybe for the next TED I'll bring it.
296	The rocking podium. (Laughter)
301	This is the pre-Columbian coffeemaker. (Laughter)
306	Actually, the idea came out of an argument that I had at Starbucks,
310	that I insisted that I wasn't having Colombian coffee;
312	the coffee was actually pre-Columbian.
314	The Bonsai table.
320	The entire Encyclopedia Britannica bound in a single volume, for travel purposes.
330	And the half tombstone, for people who are not dead yet.
336	I wanted to take that into the realm of images,
339	and I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts.
344	So I decided to do work with clouds.
346	Because clouds can mean anything you want.
349	But now I wanted to work in a very low-tech way,
352	so something that would mean at the same time
355	a lump of cotton, a cloud and Durer's praying hands --
359	although this looks a lot more like Mickey Mouse's praying hands.
363	But I was still, you know -- this is a kitty cloud.
367	"They're called ""Equivalents,"" after Alfred Stieglitz's work."
372	"""The Snail."""
373	But I was still working with sculpture,
375	and I was really trying to go flatter and flatter.
378	"""The Teapot."""
380	I had a chance to go to Florence, in -- I think it was '94,
383	"and I saw Ghiberti's ""Door of Paradise."""
387	And he did something that was very tricky.
390	He put together two different media from different periods of time.
393	First, he got an age-old way of making it, which was relief,
398	and he worked this with three-point perspective, which was brand-new technology at the time.
403	And it's totally overkill.
406	And your eye doesn't know which level to read.
408	And you become trapped into this kind of representation.
411	So I decided to make these very simple renderings,
415	that at first they are taken as a line drawing --
418	you know, something that's very -- and then I did it with wire.
422	The idea was to -- because everybody overlooks white -- like pencil drawings, you know?
428	"And they would look at it -- ""Ah, it's a pencil drawing."""
430	Then you have this double take and see that it's actually something that existed in time.
434	It had a physicality,
436	and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative
440	"that goes this way, towards the image. So this is ""Monkey with Leica."""
448	"""Relaxation."""
450	"""Fiat Lux."""
454	And the same way the history of representation
457	evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings.
460	And I wanted to deal with other subjects.
462	I started taking that into the realm of landscape,
465	which is something that's almost a picture of nothing.
469	"I made these pictures called ""Pictures of Thread,"""
471	and I named them after the amount of yards that I used to represent each picture.
475	These always end up being a photograph at the end,
477	or more like an etching in this case.
479	So this is a lighthouse.
486	"This is ""6,500 Yards,"" after Corot. ""9,000 Yards,"" after Gerhard Richter."
493	And I don't know how many yards, after John Constable.
499	Departing from the lines, I decided to tackle the idea of points,
502	like which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves.
507	I had met a group of children in the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts,
511	and I did work and play with them.
515	I got some photographs from them.
517	Upon my arrival in New York, I decided --
519	they were children of sugar plantation workers.
523	And by manipulating sugar over a black paper, I made portraits of them.
528	These are -- (Applause) --
532	"Thank you. This is ""Valentina, the Fastest."""
536	It was just the name of the child,
538	with the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly.
542	"""Valicia."""
546	"""Jacynthe."""
550	But another layer of representation was still introduced.
552	Because I was doing this while I was making these pictures,
555	I realized that I could add still another thing
558	I was trying to make a subject --
560	something that would interfere with the themes,
565	so chocolate is very good, because it has --
569	it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance.
574	And so I decided to make these pictures,
577	and they were very large, so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them.
580	"So they're called ""Pictures of Chocolate."""
581	Freud probably could explain chocolate better than I. He was the first subject.
586	And Jackson Pollock also.
592	Pictures of crowds are particularly interesting,
594	because, you know, you go to that --
596	you try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily,
599	like a face, goes into becoming just a texture.
603	"""Paparazzi."""
607	I used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection.
611	And I picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity.
615	And you render this with the most non-specific material,
618	which is dust itself.
620	Like, you know, you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor.
624	They do a DNA scan of this, they will come up with a great mailing list.
630	This is Richard Serra.
638	I bought a computer, and [they] told me it had millions of colors in it.
642	You know an artist's first response to this is, who counted it? You know?
646	And I realized that I never worked with color,
649	because I had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors.
653	But once they're applied to numeric structure,
656	then you can feel more comfortable.
658	So the first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches.
663	They end up being very large pictures,
665	and I photographed with a very large camera --
667	an 8x10 camera.
669	So you can see the surface of every single swatch --
671	like in this picture of Chuck Close.
673	And you have to walk very far to be able to see it.
678	Also, the reference to Gerhard Richter's use of color charts --
685	and the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today,
689	which is the bit map.
691	"I ended up narrowing the subject to Monet's ""Haystacks."""
697	This is something I used to do as a joke --
698	"you know, make -- the same like -- Robert Smithson's ""Spiral Jetty"" --"
703	and then leaving traces, as if it was done on a tabletop.
707	I tried to prove that he didn't do that thing in the Salt Lake.
711	But then, just doing the models, I was trying to explore the relationship
715	between the model and the original.
717	And I felt that I would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself.
723	I opt for very simple line drawings -- kind of stupid looking.
728	And at the same time, I was doing these very large constructions,
731	being 150 meters away.
734	Now I would do very small ones, which would be like --
738	but under the same light, and I would show them together,
741	so the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking.
744	I wasn't interested in the very large things, or in the small things.
747	I was more interested in the things in between,
750	you know, because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there.
756	This is like you see -- the size of a person over there.
761	This is a pipe.
766	A hanger.
768	And this is another thing that I did -- you know working
773	-- everybody loves to watch somebody draw,
775	but not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in --
778	a lot of people at the same time, to evidence a single drawing.
782	And I love this work,
785	because I did these cartoonish clouds over Manhattan for a period of two months.
790	And it was quite wonderful, because I had an interest -- an early interest -- in theater,
794	that's justified on this thing.
796	In theater, you have the character and the actor in the same place,
800	trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience.
802	And in this, you'd have like a --
804	something that looks like a cloud, and it is a cloud at the same time.
808	So they're like perfect actors.
811	My interest in acting, especially bad acting, goes a long way.
817	Actually, I once paid like 60 dollars
819	"to see a very great actor to do a version of ""King Lear,"""
823	and I felt really robbed, because by the time the actor started being King Lear,
828	he stopped being the great actor that I had paid money to see.
831	On the other hand, you know, I paid like three dollars, I think --
839	and I went to a warehouse in Queens
841	"to see a version of ""Othello"" by an amateur group."
846	And it was quite fascinating, because you know the guy --
849	his name was Joey Grimaldi --
851	he impersonated the Moorish general
854	-- you know, for the first three minutes he was really that general,
856	and then he went back into plumber, he worked as a plumber, so --
860	plumber, general, plumber, general --
863	so for three dollars, I saw two tragedies for the price of one.
869	See, I think it's not really about impression,
874	making people fall for a really perfect illusion,
876	as much as it is to make -- I usually work at the lowest threshold of visual illusion.
882	Because it's not about fooling somebody,
885	it's actually giving somebody a measure of their own belief:
888	how much you want to be fooled.
890	That's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that.
894	Well, I think that's it.
896	My time is nearly up.
897	Thank you very much.
