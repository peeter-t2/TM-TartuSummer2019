12.823	There we were,
15.354	souls and bodies packed
15.354	into a Texas church
19.428	on the last night of our lives.
22.856	Packed into a room just like this,
25.542	but with creaky wooden pews
25.542	draped in worn-down red fabric,
31.287	with an organ to my left
31.287	and a choir at my back
33.982	and a baptism pool
33.982	built into the wall behind them.
37.502	A room like this, nonetheless.
41.356	With the same great feelings of suspense,
45.08	the same deep hopes for salvation,
48.743	the same sweat in the palms
50.403	and the same people
50.403	in the back not paying attention.
53.918	(Laughter)
56.77	This was December 31, 1999,
61.033	the night of the Second Coming of Christ,
64.222	and the end of the world as I knew it.
68.022	I had turned 12 that year
69.672	and had reached the age of accountability.
72.742	And once I stopped complaining
74.566	about how unfair it was
74.566	that Jesus would return
77.041	as soon as I had to be accountable
77.041	for all that I had done,
80.554	I figured I had better get
80.554	my house in order very quickly.
84.448	So I went to church as often as I could.
86.415	I listened for silence as anxiously
86.415	as one might listen for noise,
91.271	trying to be sure that the Lord
91.271	hadn't pulled a fast one on me
94.385	and decided to come back early.
96.813	And just in case he did,
98.988	I built a backup plan,
101.277	"by reading the ""Left Behind"" books"
101.277	that were all the rage at the time.
105.651	And I found in their pages
107.139	that if I was not taken
107.139	in the rapture at midnight,
109.904	I had another shot.
111.958	All I had to do was avoid
111.958	taking the mark of the beast,
115.808	fight off demons, plagues
115.808	and the Antichrist himself.
118.944	It would be hard --
120.155	(Laughter)
123.348	but I knew I could do it.
124.93	(Laughter)
126.457	But planning time was over now.
128.269	It was 11:50pm.
130.109	We had 10 minutes left,
131.295	and my pastor called us
131.295	out of the pews and down to the altar
134.313	because he wanted to be praying
134.313	when midnight struck.
139.808	So every faction of the congregation
141.842	took its place.
143.169	The choir stayed in the choir stand,
144.939	the deacons and their wives --
146.436	or the Baptist Bourgeoisie
146.436	as I like to call them --
148.963	(Laughter)
150.273	took first position in front of the altar.
152.504	You see, in America,
154.824	even the Second Coming of Christ
154.824	has a VIP section.
157.909	(Laughter)
160.263	(Applause)
165.187	And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie
167.6	were the elderly --
169.553	these men and women whose young backs
169.553	had been bent under hot suns
174.465	in the cotton fields of East Texas,
177.137	and whose skin seemed to be burnt
177.137	a creaseless noble brown,
180.877	just like the clay of East Texas,
183.119	and whose hopes and dreams
183.119	for what life might become
185.628	outside of East Texas
186.803	had sometimes been bent and broken
188.47	even further than their backs.
189.993	Yes, these men and women
189.993	were the stars of the show for me.
194.742	They had waited their whole lives
194.742	for this moment,
197.104	just as their medieval predecessors
197.104	had longed for the end of the world,
201.9	and just as my grandmother
201.9	waited for the Oprah Winfrey Show
204.921	to come on Channel 8
204.921	every day at 4 o'clock.
208.242	And as she made her way to the altar,
210.215	I snuck right in behind her,
212.334	because I knew for sure
214.332	that my grandmother was going to heaven.
217.126	And I thought that if I held on
217.126	to her hand during this prayer,
222.282	I might go right on with her.
224.976	So I held on
226.802	and I closed my eyes
229.07	to listen,
230.678	to wait.
232.314	And the prayers got louder.
234.428	And the shouts of response
234.428	to the call of the prayer
236.893	went up higher even still.
238.725	And the organ rolled on in
238.725	to add the dirge.
241.15	And the heat came on to add to the sweat.
243.66	And my hand gripped firmer,
245	so I wouldn't be the one
245	left in the field.
247.037	My eyes clenched tighter
248.26	so I wouldn't see the wheat
248.26	being separated from the chaff.
251.256	And then a voice rang out above us:
254.269	"""Amen."""
257.474	It was over.
260.044	I looked at the clock.
262.643	It was after midnight.
265.081	I looked at the elder believers
267.697	whose savior had not come,
270.205	who were too proud to show
270.205	any signs of disappointment,
273.046	who had believed too much and for too long
275.972	to start doubting now.
279.029	But I was upset on their behalf.
282.65	They had been duped,
284.363	hoodwinked, bamboozled,
285.896	and I had gone right along with them.
288.659	I had prayed their prayers,
290.054	I had yielded not to temptation
290.054	as best I could.
293.024	I had dipped my head not once, but twice
296.074	in that snot-inducing baptism pool.
298.463	I had believed.
301.355	Now what?
303.706	I got home just in time
303.706	to turn on the television
306.845	and watch Peter Jennings
306.845	announce the new millennium
309.313	as it rolled in around the world.
311.475	It struck me that it would have
311.475	been strange anyway,
315.865	for Jesus to come back again and again
318.269	based on the different time zones.
319.929	(Laughter)
327.037	And this made me feel
327.037	even more ridiculous --
330.354	hurt, really.
333.076	But there on that night,
333.076	I did not stop believing.
337.197	I just believed a new thing:
339.487	that it was possible not to believe.
342.894	It was possible the answers
342.894	I had were wrong,
345.33	that the questions themselves were wrong.
347.701	And now, where there was once
347.701	a mountain of certitude,
351.772	there was, running right down
351.772	to its foundation,
355.168	a spring of doubt,
357.691	a spring that promised rivers.
360.357	I can trace the whole drama of my life
363.514	back to that night in that church
365.164	when my savior did not come for me;
368.069	when the thing I believed most certainly
371.328	turned out to be, if not a lie,
373.841	then not quite the truth.
376.355	And even though most of you
376.355	prepared for Y2K in a very different way,
380.937	I'm convinced that you are here
383.346	because some part of you has done
383.346	the same thing that I have done
387.278	since the dawn of this new century,
390.014	since my mother left
390.014	and my father stayed away
392.484	and my Lord refused to come.
394.867	And I held out my hand,
396.378	reaching for something to believe in.
400.587	I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18,
404.318	with the faith that my journey
404.318	from Oak Cliff, Texas
406.856	was a chance to leave behind
406.856	all the challenges I had known,
410.569	the broken dreams
410.569	and broken bodies I had seen.
414.542	But when I found myself back home
414.542	one winter break,
419.133	with my face planted in the floor,
422.268	my hands tied behind my back
425.538	and a burglar's gun pressed to my head,
427.536	I knew that even the best education
427.536	couldn't save me.
432.181	I held on when I showed up
432.181	at Lehman Brothers
435.317	as an intern in 2008.
439.048	(Laughter)
443.739	So hopeful --
445.078	(Laughter)
448.364	that I called home to inform my family
450.407	that we'd never be poor again.
451.981	(Laughter)
454.767	But as I witnessed this temple of finance
456.825	come crashing down before my eyes,
458.664	I knew that even the best job
458.664	couldn't save me.
462.599	I held on when I showed up
462.599	in Washington DC as a young staffer,
468.476	who had heard a voice
468.476	call out from Illinois,
470.725	"saying, ""It's been a long time coming,"
473.621	but in this election, change
473.621	"has come to America."""
478.549	But as the Congress ground to a halt
480.315	and the country ripped at the seams
482.057	and hope and change
482.057	began to feel like a cruel joke,
484.514	I knew that even
484.514	the political second coming
487.845	could not save me.
489.856	I had knelt faithfully at the altar
489.856	of the American Dream,
494.34	praying to the gods of my time
497.261	of success,
498.834	and money,
500.358	and power.
502.211	But over and over again,
504.619	midnight struck, and I opened my eyes
507.686	to see that all of these gods were dead.
511.447	And from that graveyard,
512.852	I began the search once more,
514.321	not because I was brave,
515.615	but because I knew
515.615	that I would either believe
519.044	or I would die.
520.963	So I took a pilgrimage
520.963	to yet another mecca,
524.409	Harvard Business School --
525.779	(Laughter)
528.307	this time, knowing that I could not
528.307	simply accept the salvation
532.216	that it claimed to offer.
533.47	No, I knew there'd be more work to do.
536.981	The work began in the dark corner
536.981	of a crowded party,
542.138	in the late night of an early,
542.138	miserable Cambridge winter,
546.457	when three friends and I asked a question
548.517	that young folks searching
548.517	for something real have asked
551.191	for a very long time:
552.982	"""What if we took a road trip?"""
554.68	(Laughter)
558.299	We didn't know where'd we go
558.299	or how we'd get there,
560.753	but we knew we had to do it.
563.108	Because all our lives we yearned,
563.108	as Jack Kerouac wrote,
566.148	"to ""sneak out into the night"
566.148	"and disappear somewhere,"""
570.991	and go find out what everybody was doing
573.068	all over the country.
575.242	So even though there were
575.242	other voices who said
577.543	that the risk was too great
577.543	and the proof too thin,
580.02	we went on anyhow.
582.354	We went on 8,000 miles across America
582.354	in the summer of 2013,
588.358	through the cow pastures of Montana,
588.358	through the desolation of Detroit,
591.822	through the swamps of New Orleans,
593.469	where we found and worked
593.469	with men and women
596.095	who were building small businesses
597.804	that made purpose their bottom line.
601.962	And having been trained
601.962	at the West Point of capitalism,
604.672	this struck us as a revolutionary idea.
606.8	(Laughter)
607.84	And this idea spread,
610.412	growing into a nonprofit
610.412	called MBAs Across America,
614.82	a movement that landed me here
614.82	on this stage today.
619.62	It spread because we found
619.62	a great hunger in our generation
623.821	for purpose, for meaning.
627.317	It spread because we found
627.317	countless entrepreneurs
630.039	in the nooks and crannies of America
631.971	who were creating jobs and changing lives
634.448	and who needed a little help.
637.082	But if I'm being honest, it also spread
640.392	because I fought to spread it.
643.204	There was no length
643.204	to which I would not go
645.471	to preach this gospel,
646.651	to get more people to believe
649.511	that we could bind the wounds
649.511	of a broken country,
651.934	one social business at a time.
655.116	But it was this journey of evangelism
659.239	that led me to the rather different gospel
662.136	that I've come to share with you today.
665.867	It began one evening almost a year ago
670.199	at the Museum of Natural History
670.199	in New York City,
674.371	at a gala for alumni
674.371	of Harvard Business School.
678.341	Under a full-size replica of a whale,
681.573	I sat with the titans of our time
683.948	as they celebrated their peers
683.948	and their good deeds.
687.727	There was pride in a room
689.035	where net worth
689.035	and assets under management
691.938	surpassed half a trillion dollars.
695.196	We looked over all that we had made,
697.863	and it was good.
699.927	(Laughter)
702.868	But it just so happened,
704.959	two days later,
706.61	I had to travel up the road to Harlem,
709.455	where I found myself
709.455	sitting in an urban farm
711.918	that had once been a vacant lot,
714.416	listening to a man named Tony
714.416	tell me of the kids
717.34	that showed up there every day.
719.944	All of them lived below the poverty line.
724.075	Many of them carried
724.075	all of their belongings in a backpack
727.519	to avoid losing them
727.519	in a homeless shelter.
730.432	Some of them came to Tony's program,
733.704	called Harlem Grown,
735.677	to get the only meal they had each day.
739.465	Tony told me that he started Harlem Grown
739.465	with money from his pension,
744.954	after 20 years as a cab driver.
748.232	He told me that he didn't give
748.232	himself a salary,
751.342	because despite success,
751.342	the program struggled for resources.
755.993	He told me that he would take any help
758.665	that he could get.
760.49	And I was there as that help.
764.863	But as I left Tony,
764.863	I felt the sting and salt of tears
769.838	welling up in my eyes.
772.509	I felt the weight of revelation
775.187	that I could sit in one room on one night,
779.206	where a few hundred people
779.206	had half a trillion dollars,
784.187	and another room, two days later,
786.82	just 50 blocks up the road,
789.971	where a man was going without a salary
792.897	to get a child her only meal of the day.
796.887	And it wasn't the glaring inequality
796.887	that made me want to cry,
800.441	it wasn't the thought of hungry,
800.441	homeless kids,
803.276	it wasn't rage toward the one percent
805.136	or pity toward the 99.
807.787	No, I was disturbed
807.787	because I had finally realized
812.33	that I was the dialysis
814.623	for a country that needed
814.623	a kidney transplant.
818.647	I realized that my story
818.647	stood in for all those
822.34	who were expected to pick
822.34	themselves up by their bootstraps,
825.206	even if they didn't have any boots;
828.182	that my organization stood in
829.879	for all the structural, systemic help
829.879	that never went to Harlem
833.653	or Appalachia or the Lower 9th Ward;
835.622	that my voice stood in
835.622	for all those voices
841.098	that seemed too unlearned,
841.098	too unwashed, too unaccommodated.
847.273	And the shame of that,
849.721	that shame washed over me
851.132	like the shame of sitting
851.132	in front of the television,
854.898	watching Peter Jennings
854.898	announce the new millennium
857.421	again
858.653	and again
860.257	and again.
861.796	I had been duped,
864.084	hoodwinked,
865.696	bamboozled.
867.403	But this time, the false savior was me.
871.6	You see, I've come a long way 
871.6	from that altar
875.326	on the night I thought
875.326	the world would end,
878.371	from a world where people spoke in tongues
881.107	and saw suffering
881.107	as a necessary act of God
884.222	and took a text to be infallible truth.
886.314	Yes, I've come so far
888.607	that I'm right back where I started.
892.103	Because it simply is not true to say
894.342	that we live in an age of disbelief --
896.247	no, we believe today just as much
896.247	as any time that came before.
901.409	Some of us may believe
901.409	in the prophecy of Brené Brown
904.276	or Tony Robbins.
906.003	We may believe in the bible
906.003	of The New Yorker
908.127	or the Harvard Business Review.
910.146	We may believe most deeply
912.15	when we worship right here
912.15	at the church of TED,
915.347	but we desperately want to believe,
917.552	we need to believe.
920.001	We speak in the tongues
920.001	of charismatic leaders
922.21	that promise to solve all our problems.
924.426	We see suffering as a necessary act
924.426	of the capitalism that is our god,
928.53	we take the text of technological progress
931.54	to be infallible truth.
934.034	And we hardly realize
934.034	the human price we pay
938.412	when we fail to question one brick,
941.692	because we fear it might shake
941.692	our whole foundation.
945.677	But if you are disturbed
948.08	by the unconscionable things
948.08	that we have come to accept,
951.777	then it must be questioning time.
955.987	So I have not a gospel
955.987	of disruption or innovation
960.058	or a triple bottom line.
962.38	I do not have a gospel of faith
962.38	to share with you today, in fact.
967.125	I have and I offer a gospel of doubt.
972	The gospel of doubt does not ask
972	that you stop believing,
975.737	it asks that you believe a new thing:
978.2	that it is possible not to believe.
981.512	It is possible the answers
981.512	we have are wrong,
983.706	it is possible the questions
983.706	themselves are wrong.
986.313	Yes, the gospel of doubt means
986.313	that it is possible that we,
990.619	on this stage, in this room,
993.178	are wrong.
994.779	"Because it raises the question, ""Why?"""
997.789	With all the power
997.789	that we hold in our hands,
1000.988	why are people still suffering so bad?
1005.209	This doubt leads me to share
1005.209	that we are putting my organization,
1009.788	MBAs Across America,
1011.078	out of business.
1012.73	We have shed our staff
1012.73	and closed our doors
1015.246	and we will share our model freely
1017.298	with anyone who sees
1017.298	their power to do this work
1020.208	without waiting for our permission.
1022.434	This doubt compels me
1025.236	to renounce the role of savior
1027.033	that some have placed on me,
1028.901	because our time is too short
1028.901	and our odds are too long
1032.02	to wait for second comings,
1033.824	when the truth is that
1033.824	there will be no miracles here.
1038.305	And this doubt, it fuels me,
1040.737	it gives me hope
1042.606	that when our troubles overwhelm us,
1045.76	when the paths laid out for us
1045.76	seem to lead to our demise,
1050.528	when our healers bring
1050.528	no comfort to our wounds,
1054.286	it will not be our blind faith --
1057.423	no, it will be our humble doubt
1060.73	that shines a little light
1060.73	into the darkness of our lives
1064.065	and of our world
1065.87	and lets us raise our voice to whisper
1068.833	or to shout
1070.437	or to say simply,
1072.176	very simply,
1073.706	"""There must be another way."""
1077.011	Thank you.
1078.186	(Applause)
