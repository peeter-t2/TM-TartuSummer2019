13	Why bother?
16.6	The game is rigged.
18.24	My vote won't count.
20.72	The choices are terrible.
22.84	Voting is for suckers.
25.28	Perhaps you've thought
25.28	some of these things.
27.44	Perhaps you've even said them.
29.52	And if so, you wouldn't be alone,
29.52	and you wouldn't be entirely wrong.
33.88	The game of public policy today
33.88	is rigged in many ways.
38.08	How else would more than half
38.08	of federal tax breaks
42.08	flow up to the wealthiest
42.08	five percent of Americans?
45.36	And our choices indeed are often terrible.
48.36	For many people
48.36	across the political spectrum,
50.56	Exhibit A is the 2016
50.56	presidential election.
54.76	But in any year, you can look
54.76	up and down the ballot
57.32	and find plenty to be uninspired about.
61.56	But in spite of all this,
61.56	I still believe voting matters.
65	And crazy as it may sound,
66.92	I believe we can revive the joy of voting.
69.96	Today, I want to talk
69.96	about how we can do that, and why.
74.68	There used to be a time
74.68	in American history when voting was fun,
78.28	when it was much more than just
78.28	a grim duty to show up at the polls.
82.08	That time is called
82.08	"""most of American history."""
84.52	(Laughter)
85.96	From the Revolution
85.96	to the Civil Rights Era,
88.96	the United States had a vibrant,
90.56	robustly participatory
90.56	and raucous culture of voting.
95.48	It was street theater, open-air debates,
95.48	fasting and feasting and toasting,
99.64	parades and bonfires.
101.72	During the 19th century,
101.72	immigrants and urban political machines
105.28	helped fuel this culture of voting.
107.6	That culture grew with each
107.6	successive wave of new voters.
113.04	During Reconstruction,
113.04	when new African-American voters,
116	new African-American citizens,
118.56	began to exercise their power,
120.6	they celebrated in jubilee parades
122.84	that connected emancipation
122.84	with their newfound right to vote.
126.92	A few decades later, the suffragettes
129.68	brought a spirit
129.68	of theatricality to their fight,
132.8	marching together in white dresses
132.8	as they claimed the franchise.
136.68	And the Civil Rights Movement,
138.24	which sought to redeem
138.24	the promise of equal citizenship
141.039	that had been betrayed by Jim Crow,
143.8	put voting right at the center.
146.16	From Freedom Summer to the march in Selma,
148.76	that generation of activists
148.76	knew that voting matters,
152	and they knew that spectacle
152	and the performance of power
155.12	is key to actually claiming power.
158.56	But it's been over a half century
158.56	since Selma and the Voting Rights Act,
162.88	and in the decades since,
164.88	this face-to-face culture of voting
167.2	has just about disappeared.
169.2	It's been killed by television
171.16	and then the internet.
172.72	The couch has replaced the commons.
175.04	Screens have made
175.04	citizens into spectators.
178.04	And while it's nice to share
178.04	political memes on social media,
181.36	that's a rather quiet kind of citizenship.
184.56	It's what the sociologist Sherry Turkle
184.56	"calls ""being alone together."""
189.36	What we need today
190.84	is an electoral culture
190.84	that is about being together together,
194.72	in person,
195.96	in loud and passionate ways,
198.2	so that instead of being
198.2	"""eat your vegetables"" or ""do you duty,"""
202.48	"voting can feel more like ""join the club"""
205.48	"or, better yet, ""join the party."""
208.16	Imagine if we had,
208.16	across the country right now,
211.72	in local places but nationwide,
214.68	a concerted effort
214.68	to revive a face-to-face set of ways
218.36	to engage and electioneer:
220.6	outdoor shows in which candidates
220.6	and their causes are mocked
224.48	and praised in broad satirical style;
227.2	soapbox speeches by citizens;
229.84	public debates held inside pubs;
233.92	streets filled with political art
233.92	and handmade posters and murals;
238.68	battle of the band concerts in which
238.68	competing performers rep their candidates.
244.36	Now, all of this may sound
244.36	a little bit 18th century to you,
248.44	but in fact, it doesn't have to be
248.44	any more 18th century
251.8	"than, say, Broadway's ""Hamilton,"""
255.04	which is to say vibrantly contemporary.
257.64	And the fact is that all around the world,
259.664	today, millions of people
259.664	are voting like this.
263.28	In India, elections are colorful,
263.28	communal affairs.
267.56	In Brazil, election day
267.56	is a festive, carnival-type atmosphere.
272.959	In Taiwan and Hong Kong,
272.959	there is a spectacle,
275.48	eye-popping, eye-grabbing spectacle
277.76	to the street theater of elections.
280.72	You might ask, well,
280.72	here in America, who has time for this?
284.48	And I would tell you
285.76	that the average American
285.76	watches five hours of television a day.
290.24	You might ask, who has the motivation?
292.56	And I'll tell you,
293.8	any citizen who wants to be seen and heard
297.96	not as a prop, not as a talking point,
300.28	but as a participant, as a creator.
303.72	Well, how do we make this happen?
306.8	Simply by making it happen.
308.92	That's why a group of colleagues and I
310.8	launched a new project
310.8	"called ""The Joy of Voting."""
314.88	In four cities across the United States --
317.36	Philadelphia, Miami,
319.04	Akron, Ohio, and Wichita, Kansas --
321.52	we've gathered together
321.52	artists and activists,
324.48	educators, political folks,
324.48	neighbors, everyday citizens
328.24	to come together and create projects
330	that can foster this culture
330	of voting in a local way.
334.24	In Miami, that means
334.24	all-night parties with hot DJs
337.32	where the only way to get in
337.32	is to show that you're registered to vote.
341.16	In Akron, it means political plays
344.2	being performed
344.2	in the bed of a flatbed truck
346.76	that moves from neighborhood
346.76	to neighborhood.
349.96	In Philadelphia,
351.2	it's a voting-themed scavenger hunt
351.2	all throughout colonial old town.
355.16	And in Wichita, it's making
355.16	mixtapes and live graffiti art
360.2	in the North End to get out the vote.
362.76	There are 20 of these projects,
364.28	and they are remarkable
364.28	in their beauty and their diversity,
367.16	and they are changing people.
368.76	Let me tell you about a couple of them.
370.84	In Miami, we've commissioned and artist,
372.84	a young artist named Atomico,
374.88	to create some vivid and vibrant images
374.88	"for a new series of ""I voted"" stickers."
379.88	But the thing is, Atomico had never voted.
383.08	He wasn't even registered.
384.8	So as he got to work on creating
384.8	this artwork for these stickers,
389.32	he also began to get over
389.32	his sense of intimidation about politics.
393.48	He got himself registered,
395.12	and then he got educated
395.12	about the upcoming primary election,
398.44	and on election day he was out there
398.44	not just passing out stickers,
401.76	but chatting up voters
401.76	and encouraging people to vote,
404.36	and talking about
404.36	the election with passersby.
407.72	In Akron, a theater company
407.72	called the Wandering Aesthetics
411.52	has been putting on
411.52	these pickup truck plays.
414.32	And to do so, they put out
414.32	an open call to the public
417.12	asking for speeches,
417.12	monologues, dialogues, poems,
420.64	snippets of anything
420.64	that could be read aloud
423	and woven into a performance.
425.28	They got dozens of submissions.
427.72	One of them was a poem
429.64	written by nine students in an ESL class,
432.8	all of them Hispanic migrant workers
434.96	from nearby Hartville, Ohio.
437.88	I want to read to you from this poem.
441.2	"It's called ""The Joy of Voting."""
444.6	"""I would like to vote for the first time"
447.04	because things are changing for Hispanics.
450	I used to be afraid of ghosts.
452.16	Now I am afraid of people.
454.48	There's more violence and racism.
456.96	Voting can change this.
459.84	The border wall is nothing.
461.8	It's just a wall.
464.04	The wall of shame is something.
467.8	It's very important to vote
469.72	so we can break down this wall of shame.
473.32	I have passion in my heart.
475.48	Voting gives me a voice and power.
478.4	"I can stand up and do something."""
482.96	"""The Joy of Voting"" project"
482.96	isn't just about joy.
485.92	It's about this passion.
487.48	It's about feeling and belief,
489.84	and it isn't just our organization's work.
492.56	All across this country right now,
494.52	immigrants, young people, veterans,
494.52	people of all different backgrounds
497.92	are coming together to create
497.92	this kind of passionate, joyful activity
501.44	around elections,
502.88	in red and blue states,
502.88	in urban and rural communities,
505.84	people of every political background.
507.96	What they have in common is simply this:
510.68	their work is rooted in place.
514.32	Because remember,
514.32	all citizenship is local.
517.72	When politics becomes
517.72	just a presidential election,
521.28	we yell and we scream at our screens,
521.28	and then we collapse, exhausted.
525.679	But when politics is about us
529.32	and our neighbors
529.32	and other people in our community
532.12	coming together to create experiences
532.12	of collective voice and imagination,
537.44	then we begin to remember
537.44	that this stuff matters.
540.56	We begin to remember
540.56	that this is the stuff of self-government.
545.24	Which brings me back to where I began.
547.88	Why bother?
549.64	There's one way to answer this question.
552.44	Voting matters because it is
552.44	a self-fulfilling act of belief.
557.44	It feeds the spirit of mutual interest
557.44	that makes any society thrive.
562.96	When we vote, even if it is in anger,
565.64	we are part of a collective,
565.64	creative leap of faith.
569.84	Voting helps us generate
569.84	the very power that we wish we had.
574.24	It's no accident
574.24	that democracy and theater
577.08	emerged around the same time
577.08	in ancient Athens.
580.2	Both of them yank the individual
580.2	out of the enclosure of her private self.
585.44	Both of them create great
585.44	public experiences of shared ritual.
590.2	Both of them bring the imagination to life
592.76	in ways that remind us
592.76	that all of our bonds in the end
596.08	are imagined, and can be reimagined.
602.76	This moment right now,
604.8	when we think about
604.8	the meaning of imagination,
608.24	is so fundamentally important,
612.48	and our ability to take that spirit
615.68	and to take that sense
617.28	that there is something greater out there,
619.36	is not just a matter
619.36	of technical expertise.
623.16	It's not just a matter of making the time
623.16	or having the know-how.
626.24	It is a matter of spirit.
628.72	But let me give you an answer
628.72	"to this question, ""Why bother?"""
631.68	that is maybe a little less spiritual
631.68	and a bit more pointed.
636.44	Why bother voting?
638.24	Because there is
638.24	no such thing as not voting.
641.16	Not voting is voting,
643	for everything that you
643	may detest and oppose.
645.92	Not voting can be dressed up
647.68	as an act of principled,
647.68	passive resistance,
650.72	but in fact not voting
652.68	is actively handing power over
654.92	to those whose interests
654.92	are counter to your own,
657.28	and those who would be very glad
657.28	to take advantage of your absence.
660.84	Not voting is for suckers.
664.8	Imagine where this country would be
666.52	if all the folks who in 2010
666.52	created the Tea Party
669.64	had decided that,
669.64	you know, politics is too messy,
672.6	voting is too complicated.
673.88	There is no possibility
673.88	of our votes adding up to anything.
677.32	They didn't preemptively
677.32	silence themselves.
679.64	They showed up,
681.44	and in the course of showing up,
681.44	they changed American politics.
685.48	Imagine if all of the followers
685.48	of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders
690.28	had decided not to upend
690.28	the political status quo
694	and blow apart the frame
694	of the previously possible
697.08	in American politics.
698.72	They did that by voting.
703.16	We live in a time right now,
705.4	divided, often very dark,
707.96	where across the left and the right,
707.96	there's a lot of talk of revolution
711.6	and the need for revolution
711.6	to disrupt everyday democracy.
715.12	Well, here's the thing:
716.76	everyday democracy already
716.76	gives us a playbook for revolution.
720.76	In the 2012 presidential election,
722.84	young voters, Latino voters,
724.6	Asian-American voters, low-income voters,
726.88	all showed up at less than 50 percent.
731.2	In the 2014 midterm elections,
731.2	turnout was 36 percent,
735.28	which was a 70-year low.
737.92	And in your average local election,
739.84	turnout hovers
739.84	somewhere around 20 percent.
743.32	I invite you to imagine 100 percent.
747.64	Picture 100 percent.
750.08	Mobilize 100 percent,
752.24	and overnight, we get revolution.
755.04	Overnight, the policy priorities
755.04	of this country change dramatically,
759.08	and every level of government
759.08	becomes radically more responsive
762.64	to all the people.
765.24	What would it take
765.24	to mobilize 100 percent?
768.48	Well, we do have to push back
768.48	against efforts afoot
771.04	all across the country right now
772.8	to make voting harder.
774.48	But at the same time,
776	we have to actively create
776	a positive culture of voting
779.16	that people want to belong to,
780.8	be part of, and experience together.
783.36	We have to make purpose.
785	We have to make joy.
787.16	So yes, let's have that revolution,
789.84	a revolution of spirit, of ideas,
792.36	of policy and participation,
794.4	a revolution against cynicism,
796.56	a revolution against the self-fulfilling
796.56	sense of powerlessness.
800.52	Let's vote this revolution into existence,
803.88	and while we're at it,
805.24	let's have some fun.
806.8	Thank you very much.
808.04	(Applause)
