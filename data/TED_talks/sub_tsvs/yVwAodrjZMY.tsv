13.072	Chris Anderson: The rights of citizens,
15.083	the future of the Internet.
17.169	So I would like to welcome to the TED stage
20.552	the man behind those revelations,
23.378	Ed Snowden.
25.754	(Applause)
29.321	Ed is in a remote location somewhere in Russia
33.574	controlling this bot from his laptop,
36.349	so he can see what the bot can see.
40.402	Ed, welcome to the TED stage.
42.35	What can you see, as a matter of fact?
45.961	Edward Snowden: Ha, I can see everyone.
47.699	This is amazing.
49.949	(Laughter)
53.162	CA: Ed, some questions for you.
56.445	You've been called many things
57.738	in the last few months.
59.303	You've been called a whistleblower, a traitor,
64.228	a hero.
65.957	What words would you describe yourself with?
69.774	ES: You know, everybody who is involved
72.436	with this debate
73.932	has been struggling over me and my personality
76.674	and how to describe me.
79.723	But when I think about it,
81.412	this isn't the question that
81.412	we should be struggling with.
84.841	Who I am really doesn't matter at all.
88.008	If I'm the worst person in the world,
90.72	you can hate me and move on.
92.677	What really matters here are the issues.
95.212	What really matters here is the
95.212	kind of government we want,
98.047	the kind of Internet we want,
99.56	the kind of relationship between people
102.118	and societies.
103.458	And that's what I'm hoping
103.458	the debate will move towards,
106.546	and we've seen that increasing over time.
108.918	If I had to describe myself,
110.828	"I wouldn't use words like ""hero."""
112.172	"I wouldn't use ""patriot,"" and I wouldn't use ""traitor."""
114.874	I'd say I'm an American and I'm a citizen,
117.068	just like everyone else.
119.632	CA: So just to give some context
121.505	for those who don't know the whole story --
123.701	(Applause) —
127.431	this time a year ago, you were stationed in Hawaii
131.994	working as a consultant to the NSA.
134.384	As a sysadmin, you had access
136.428	to their systems,
138.833	and you began revealing
138.833	certain classified documents
143.087	to some handpicked journalists
146.287	leading the way to June's revelations.
147.878	Now, what propelled you to do this?
153.254	ES: You know,
156.04	when I was sitting in Hawaii,
158.22	and the years before, when I was
158.22	working in the intelligence community,
160.878	I saw a lot of things that had disturbed me.
164.6	We do a lot of good things
164.6	in the intelligence community,
167.877	things that need to be done,
169.07	and things that help everyone.
171.767	But there are also things that go too far.
173.724	There are things that shouldn't be done,
175.02	and decisions that were being made in secret
178.088	without the public's awareness,
179.336	without the public's consent,
181.848	and without even our representatives in government
184.7	having knowledge of these programs.
188.333	When I really came to struggle with these issues,
192.866	I thought to myself,
194.488	how can I do this in the most responsible way,
197.574	that maximizes the public benefit
200.582	while minimizing the risks?
203.293	And out of all the solutions that I could come up with,
206.381	out of going to Congress,
208.623	when there were no laws,
209.926	there were no legal protections
211.611	for a private employee,
213.378	a contractor in intelligence like myself,
216.711	there was a risk that I would be
216.711	buried along with the information
220.358	and the public would never find out.
222.265	But the First Amendment of
222.265	the United States Constitution
225.287	guarantees us a free press for a reason,
228.828	and that's to enable an adversarial press,
232.033	to challenge the government,
233.93	but also to work together with the government,
236.564	to have a dialogue and debate about how we can
238.882	inform the public about matters of vital importance
244.321	without putting our national security at risk.
247.451	And by working with journalists,
249.127	by giving all of my information
251.281	back to the American people,
253.558	rather than trusting myself to make
255.329	the decisions about publication,
258.063	we've had a robust debate
260.299	with a deep investment by the government
263.566	that I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone.
268.672	And the risks that have been threatened,
272.447	the risks that have been played up
274.58	by the government
276.132	have never materialized.
277.558	We've never seen any evidence
279.636	of even a single instance of specific harm,
283.192	and because of that,
284.661	I'm comfortable with the decisions that I made.
286.788	CA: So let me show the audience
289.001	a couple of examples of what you revealed.
291.47	If we could have a slide up, and Ed,
293.382	I don't know whether you can see,
295.137	the slides are here.
296.251	This is a slide of the PRISM program,
298.836	and maybe you could tell the audience
301.305	what that was that was revealed.
303.911	ES: The best way to understand PRISM,
306.123	because there's been a little bit of controversy,
307.584	is to first talk about what PRISM isn't.
311.335	Much of the debate in the U.S.
311.335	has been about metadata.
314.09	They've said it's just metadata, it's just metadata,
316.981	and they're talking about a specific legal authority
319.722	called Section 215 of the Patriot Act.
322.427	That allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping,
325.496	mass surveillance of the entire country's
327.859	phone records, things like that --
330.016	who you're talking to,
331.378	when you're talking to them,
333.406	where you traveled.
334.702	These are all metadata events.
337.203	PRISM is about content.
340.549	It's a program through which the government could
342.689	compel corporate America,
344.733	it could deputize corporate America
348.126	to do its dirty work for the NSA.
351.99	And even though some of
351.99	these companies did resist,
354.986	even though some of them --
356.409	I believe Yahoo was one of them —
357.655	challenged them in court, they all lost,
360.312	because it was never tried by an open court.
363.227	They were only tried by a secret court.
366.358	And something that we've seen,
367.725	something about the PRISM program
367.725	that's very concerning to me is,
370.429	there's been a talking point in the U.S. government
372.408	where they've said 15 federal judges
376.159	have reviewed these programs
376.159	and found them to be lawful,
378.857	but what they don't tell you
381.577	is those are secret judges
384.207	in a secret court
386.209	based on secret interpretations of law
389.283	that's considered 34,000 warrant requests
393.517	over 33 years,
395.976	and in 33 years only rejected
401.046	These aren't the people that we want deciding
403.793	what the role of corporate America
405.939	in a free and open Internet should be.
408.395	CA: Now, this slide that we're showing here
410.506	shows the dates in which
412.718	different technology companies, Internet companies,
415.133	are alleged to have joined the program,
417.487	and where data collection began from them.
420.445	Now, they have denied collaborating with the NSA.
425.194	How was that data collected by the NSA?
430.298	ES: Right. So the NSA's own slides
433.477	refer to it as direct access.
436.277	What that means to an actual NSA analyst,
439.027	someone like me who was working
439.027	as an intelligence analyst
442.135	targeting, Chinese cyber-hackers,
444.606	things like that, in Hawaii,
446.688	is the provenance of that data
448.657	is directly from their servers.
450.913	It doesn't mean
452.977	that there's a group of company representatives
455.783	sitting in a smoky room with the NSA
458.22	palling around and making back-room deals
460.01	about how they're going to give this stuff away.
462.553	Now each company handles it different ways.
464.946	Some are responsible.
466.122	Some are somewhat less responsible.
468.213	But the bottom line is, when we talk about
469.981	how this information is given,
473.36	it's coming from the companies themselves.
475.846	It's not stolen from the lines.
478.141	But there's an important thing to remember here:
480.073	even though companies pushed back,
482.004	even though companies demanded,
484.057	hey, let's do this through a warrant process,
486.603	let's do this
488.377	where we actually have some sort of legal review,
491.526	some sort of basis for handing over
493.357	these users' data,
495.297	we saw stories in the Washington Post last year
497.688	that weren't as well reported as the PRISM story
500.9	that said the NSA broke in
503.499	to the data center communications
505.3	between Google to itself
507.456	and Yahoo to itself.
509.034	So even these companies that are cooperating
511.866	in at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner
514.737	with the NSA,
516.61	the NSA isn't satisfied with that,
519.906	and because of that, we need our companies
521.884	to work very hard
524.699	to guarantee that they're going to represent
527.171	the interests of the user, and also advocate
529.757	for the rights of the users.
531.673	And I think over the last year,
532.947	we've seen the companies that are named
534.53	on the PRISM slides
535.948	take great strides to do that,
537.757	and I encourage them to continue.
540.01	CA: What more should they do?
542.692	ES: The biggest thing that an Internet company
546.209	in America can do today, right now,
549.435	without consulting with lawyers,
550.877	to protect the rights of users worldwide,
554.416	is to enable SSL web encryption
559.799	on every page you visit.
561.804	The reason this matters is today,
564.746	"if you go to look at a copy of ""1984"" on Amazon.com,"
569.984	the NSA can see a record of that,
572.431	the Russian intelligence service
572.431	can see a record of that,
574.65	the Chinese service can see a record of that,
577.107	the French service, the German service,
579.005	the services of Andorra.
580.327	They can all see it because it's unencrypted.
583.605	The world's library is Amazon.com,
587.205	but not only do they not
587.205	support encryption by default,
589.86	you cannot choose to use encryption
592.026	when browsing through books.
593.753	This is something that we need to change,
595.462	not just for Amazon, I don't mean to single them out,
597.337	but they're a great example.
598.829	All companies need to move
600.497	to an encrypted browsing habit by default
603.89	for all users who haven't taken any action
606.374	or picked any special methods on their own.
608.635	That'll increase the privacy and the rights
610.946	that people enjoy worldwide.
613.711	CA: Ed, come with me to this part of the stage.
616.189	I want to show you the next slide here. (Applause)
619.142	This is a program called Boundless Informant.
621.85	What is that?
623.526	ES: So, I've got to give credit to the NSA
625.706	for using appropriate names on this.
628.149	This is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms.
631.994	Boundless Informant
633.464	is a program that the NSA hid from Congress.
636.314	The NSA was previously asked by Congress,
638.723	was there any ability that they had
640.936	to even give a rough ballpark estimate
644.694	of the amount of American communications
646.88	that were being intercepted.
649.014	They said no. They said, we don't track those stats,
652.045	and we can't track those stats.
653.594	We can't tell you how many communications
656.698	we're intercepting around the world,
658.161	because to tell you that would be
659.648	to invade your privacy.
662.955	Now, I really appreciate that sentiment from them,
665.17	but the reality, when you look at this slide is,
667.305	not only do they have the capability,
668.958	the capability already exists.
671.574	It's already in place.
673.248	The NSA has its own internal data format
676.396	that tracks both ends of a communication,
680.545	and if it says,
681.827	this communication came from America,
683.853	they can tell Congress how
683.853	many of those communications
686.209	they have today, right now.
688.725	And what Boundless Informant tells us
691.696	is more communications are being intercepted
694.422	in America about Americans
697.395	than there are in Russia about Russians.
700.815	I'm not sure that's what an intelligence agency
702.68	should be aiming for.
704.999	CA: Ed, there was a story broken
704.999	in the Washington Post,
707.405	again from your data.
709.127	The headline says,
710.806	"""NSA broke privacy rules"
712.303	"thousands of times per year."""
714.333	Tell us about that.
715.871	ES: We also heard in Congressional
715.871	testimony last year,
718.464	it was an amazing thing for someone like me
720.401	who came from the NSA
722.105	and who's seen the actual internal documents,
724.677	knows what's in them,
727.268	to see officials testifying under oath
729.808	that there had been no abuses,
731.69	that there had been no violations of the NSA's rules,
735.323	when we knew this story was coming.
738.264	But what's especially interesting about this,
740.352	about the fact that the NSA has violated
742.4	their own rules, their own laws
744.768	thousands of times in a single year,
747.441	including one event by itself,
750.168	one event out of those 2,776,
755.144	that affected more than 3,000 people.
757.45	In another event, they intercepted
759.289	all the calls in Washington, D.C., by accident.
763.501	What's amazing about this,
765.738	this report, that didn't get that much attention,
767.946	is the fact that not only were there 2,776 abuses,
772.807	the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
774.948	Dianne Feinstein, had not seen this report
778.935	until the Washington Post contacted her
782.126	asking for comment on the report.
784.574	And she then requested a copy from the NSA
786.467	and received it,
788.168	but had never seen this before that.
790.195	What does that say about the state of oversight
792.882	in American intelligence
794.619	when the chairman of the
794.619	Senate Intelligence Committee
796.407	has no idea that the rules are being broken
799.2	thousands of times every year?
801.36	CA: Ed, one response to this whole debate is this:
804.989	Why should we care about
807.654	all this surveillance, honestly?
809.122	I mean, look, if you've done nothing wrong,
811.274	you've got nothing to worry about.
814.058	What's wrong with that point of view?
816.35	ES: Well, so the first thing is,
817.998	you're giving up your rights.
819.711	You're saying hey, you know,
821.069	I don't think I'm going to need them,
823.441	so I'm just going to trust that, you know,
825.123	let's get rid of them, it doesn't really matter,
828.101	these guys are going to do the right thing.
830.075	Your rights matter
831.934	because you never know when
831.934	you're going to need them.
834.776	Beyond that, it's a part of our cultural identity,
837.058	not just in America,
839.19	but in Western societies
840.781	and in democratic societies around the world.
843.743	People should be able to pick up the phone
846.147	and to call their family,
847.601	people should be able to send a text message
849.6	to their loved ones,
850.728	people should be able to buy a book online,
853.182	they should be able to travel by train,
854.972	they should be able to buy an airline ticket
857.189	without wondering about how these events
858.926	are going to look to an agent of the government,
862.611	possibly not even your government
865.201	years in the future,
866.956	how they're going to be misinterpreted
868.696	and what they're going to think your intentions were.
871.48	We have a right to privacy.
873.554	We require warrants to be based on probable cause
877.172	or some kind of individualized suspicion
879.636	because we recognize that trusting anybody,
884.163	any government authority,
885.757	with the entirety of human communications
888.841	in secret and without oversight
891.274	is simply too great a temptation to be ignored.
896.118	CA: Some people are furious at what you've done.
898.677	I heard a quote recently from Dick Cheney
901.516	who said that Julian Assange was a flea bite,
907.408	Edward Snowden is the lion
907.408	that bit the head off the dog.
910.83	He thinks you've committed
912.383	one of the worst acts of betrayal
914.675	in American history.
916.781	What would you say to people who think that?
922.975	ES: Dick Cheney's really something else.
925.18	(Laughter) (Applause)
932.476	Thank you. (Laughter)
937.378	I think it's amazing, because at the time
939.854	Julian Assange was doing some of his greatest work,
943.629	Dick Cheney was saying
945.065	he was going to end governments worldwide,
947.495	the skies were going to ignite
950.4	and the seas were going to boil off,
952.536	and now he's saying it's a flea bite.
954.754	So we should be suspicious about the same sort of
957.267	overblown claims of damage to national security
961.46	from these kind of officials.
963.145	But let's assume that these
963.145	people really believe this.
969.994	I would argue that they have kind of
972.224	a narrow conception of national security.
976.594	The prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney
979.841	do not keep the nation safe.
982.822	The public interest is not always the same
986.855	as the national interest.
989.29	Going to war with people who are not our enemy
993.184	in places that are not a threat
995.314	doesn't make us safe,
997.481	and that applies whether it's in Iraq
999.648	or on the Internet.
1001.415	The Internet is not the enemy.
1002.938	Our economy is not the enemy.
1004.963	American businesses, Chinese businesses,
1007.249	and any other company out there
1011.82	is a part of our society.
1014.251	It's a part of our interconnected world.
1016.465	There are ties of fraternity that bond us together,
1020.91	and if we destroy these bonds
1023.578	by undermining the standards, the security,
1026.733	the manner of behavior,
1029.59	that nations and citizens all around the world
1032.541	expect us to abide by.
1034.918	CA: But it's alleged that you've stolen
1038.62	1.7 million documents.
1040.519	It seems only a few hundred of them
1042.346	have been shared with journalists so far.
1045.203	Are there more revelations to come?
1048.248	ES: There are absolutely more revelations to come.
1050.69	I don't think there's any question
1053.491	that some of the most important reporting
1057.738	to be done is yet to come.
1062.478	CA: Come here, because I want to ask you
1064.54	about this particular revelation.
1066.067	Come and take a look at this.
1069.089	I mean, this is a story which I think
1069.089	for a lot of the techies in this room
1072.337	is the single most shocking thing
1074.076	that they have heard in the last few months.
1076.436	"It's about a program called ""Bullrun."""
1079.061	Can you explain what that is?
1082.837	ES: So Bullrun, and this is again
1084.545	where we've got to thank the NSA for their candor,
1091.642	this is a program named after a Civil War battle.
1096.232	The British counterpart is called Edgehill,
1097.845	which is a U.K. civil war battle.
1099.32	And the reason that I believe they're named this way
1101.527	is because they target our own infrastructure.
1105.016	They're programs through which the NSA
1107.707	intentionally misleads corporate partners.
1111.922	They tell corporate partners that these
1113.804	are safe standards.
1115.479	They say hey, we need to work with you
1117.498	to secure your systems,
1121.151	but in reality, they're giving bad advice
1124.344	to these companies that makes them
1125.61	degrade the security of their services.
1127.905	They're building in backdoors that not only
1130.234	the NSA can exploit,
1132.592	but anyone else who has time and money
1135.113	to research and find it
1137.233	can then use to let themselves in
1139.367	to the world's communications.
1141.237	And this is really dangerous,
1143.007	because if we lose a single standard,
1147.191	if we lose the trust of something like SSL,
1150.25	which was specifically targeted
1151.732	by the Bullrun program,
1153.855	we will live a less safe world overall.
1156.523	We won't be able to access our banks
1158.63	and we won't be able to access commerce
1163.883	without worrying about people
1163.883	monitoring those communications
1166.706	or subverting them for their own ends.
1168.884	CA: And do those same decisions also potentially
1172.953	open America up to cyberattacks
1175.939	from other sources?
1179.855	ES: Absolutely.
1181.32	One of the problems,
1183.052	one of the dangerous legacies
1186.502	that we've seen in the post-9/11 era,
1189.994	is that the NSA has traditionally worn two hats.
1194.231	They've been in charge of offensive operations,
1196.157	that is hacking,
1197.278	but they've also been in
1197.278	charge of defensive operations,
1199.988	and traditionally they've always prioritized
1202.351	defense over offense
1203.738	based on the principle
1205.128	that American secrets are simply worth more.
1207.944	If we hack a Chinese business
1210.054	and steal their secrets,
1211.738	if we hack a government office in Berlin
1213.821	and steal their secrets,
1215.919	that has less value to the American people
1219.526	than making sure that the Chinese
1221.626	can't get access to our secrets.
1224.132	So by reducing the security of our communications,
1228.263	they're not only putting the world at risk,
1230.291	they're putting America at risk in a fundamental way,
1232.563	because intellectual property is the basis,
1235.234	the foundation of our economy,
1237.161	and if we put that at risk through weak security,
1239.419	we're going to be paying for it for years.
1241.048	CA: But they've made a calculation
1242.595	that it was worth doing this
1244.786	as part of America's defense against terrorism.
1248.325	Surely that makes it a price worth paying.
1251.937	ES: Well, when you look at the results
1255.824	of these programs in stopping terrorism,
1258.131	you will see that that's unfounded,
1261.881	and you don't have to take my word for it,
1263.8	because we've had the first open court,
1267.572	the first federal court that's reviewed this,
1269.941	outside the secrecy arrangement,
1272.737	called these programs Orwellian
1274.724	and likely unconstitutional.
1276.958	Congress, who has access
1279.697	to be briefed on these things,
1281.008	and now has the desire to be,
1283.99	has produced bills to reform it,
1286.397	and two independent White House panels
1289.282	who reviewed all of the classified evidence
1291.372	said these programs have never stopped
1294.005	a single terrorist attack
1295.766	that was imminent in the United States.
1299.269	So is it really terrorism that we're stopping?
1302.455	Do these programs have any value at all?
1304.786	I say no, and all three branches
1307.03	of the American government say no as well.
1309.462	CA: I mean, do you think there's a deeper motivation
1311.275	for them than the war against terrorism?
1314.56	ES: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you, say again?
1316.11	CA: Sorry. Do you think there's a deeper motivation
1319.11	for them other than the war against terrorism?
1322.989	ES: Yeah. The bottom line is that terrorism
1325.684	has always been what we in the intelligence world
1327.885	would call a cover for action.
1331.158	Terrorism is something that provokes
1333.083	an emotional response that allows people
1335.313	to rationalize authorizing powers and programs
1339.67	that they wouldn't give otherwise.
1342.114	The Bullrun and Edgehill-type programs,
1344.6	the NSA asked for these authorities
1346.317	back in the 1990s.
1348.254	They asked the FBI to go to
1348.254	Congress and make the case.
1351.244	The FBI went to Congress and did make the case.
1353.418	But Congress and the American people said no.
1355.983	They said, it's not worth the risk to our economy.
1358.394	They said it's worth too much damage
1360.313	to our society to justify the gains.
1363	But what we saw is, in the post-9/11 era,
1367.275	they used secrecy and they
1367.275	used the justification of terrorism
1370.526	to start these programs in secret
1372.46	without asking Congress,
1374.272	without asking the American people,
1376.452	and it's that kind of government behind closed doors
1379.19	that we need to guard ourselves against,
1381.749	because it makes us less safe,
1382.999	and it offers no value.
1384.891	CA: Okay, come with me here for a sec,
1386.757	because I've got a more personal question for you.
1388.939	Speaking of terror,
1391.863	most people would find the
1391.863	situation you're in right now
1395.82	in Russia pretty terrifying.
1399.116	You obviously heard what happened,
1402.703	what the treatment that Bradley Manning got,
1404.896	Chelsea Manning as now is,
1407.177	and there was a story in Buzzfeed saying that
1409.664	there are people in the intelligence community
1411.322	who want you dead.
1413.601	How are you coping with this?
1415.541	How are you coping with the fear?
1417.49	ES: It's no mystery
1420.494	that there are governments out
1420.494	there that want to see me dead.
1426.142	I've made clear again and again and again
1429.552	that I go to sleep every morning
1432.918	thinking about what I can
1432.918	do for the American people.
1437.478	I don't want to harm my government.
1440.51	I want to help my government,
1443.773	but the fact that they are willing to
1447.581	completely ignore due process,
1449.901	they're willing to declare guilt
1452.609	without ever seeing a trial,
1455.895	these are things that we need to work against
1458.311	as a society, and say hey, this is not appropriate.
1461.889	We shouldn't be threatening dissidents.
1463.716	We shouldn't be criminalizing journalism.
1466.73	And whatever part I can do to see that end,
1470.049	I'm happy to do despite the risks.
1473.202	CA: So I'd actually like to get some feedback
1474.726	from the audience here,
1475.945	because I know there's widely differing reactions
1478.049	to Edward Snowden.
1479.99	Suppose you had the following two choices, right?
1482.278	You could view what he did
1485.084	as fundamentally a reckless act
1486.978	that has endangered America
1490.197	or you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act
1493.76	that will work towards America and the world's
1497.235	long-term good?
1498.622	Those are the two choices I'll give you.
1501.94	I'm curious to see who's willing to vote with
1504.095	the first of those,
1505.512	that this was a reckless act?
1508.921	There are some hands going up.
1510.576	Some hands going up.
1511.96	It's hard to put your hand up
1513.236	when the man is standing right here,
1515.347	but I see them.
1516.912	ES: I can see you. (Laughter)
1519.443	CA: And who goes with the second choice,
1521.704	the fundamentally heroic act?
1523.587	(Applause) (Cheers)
1526.234	And I think it's true to say that
1526.234	there are a lot of people
1528.808	who didn't show a hand and I think
1531.033	are still thinking this through,
1532.743	because it seems to me that the debate around you
1536.201	doesn't split along traditional political lines.
1539.31	It's not left or right, it's not really about
1541.564	pro-government, libertarian, or not just that.
1545.686	Part of it is almost a generational issue.
1548.399	You're part of a generation that grew up
1550.207	with the Internet, and it seems as if
1553.133	you become offended at almost a visceral level
1556.341	when you see something done
1557.637	that you think will harm the Internet.
1559.699	Is there some truth to that?
1563.272	ES: It is. I think it's very true.
1568.32	This is not a left or right issue.
1571.418	Our basic freedoms, and when I say our,
1573.995	I don't just mean Americans,
1575.542	I mean people around the world,
1577.555	it's not a partisan issue.
1579.901	These are things that all people believe,
1581.94	and it's up to all of us to protect them,
1584.465	and to people who have seen and enjoyed
1587.297	a free and open Internet,
1588.958	it's up to us to preserve that liberty
1592.184	for the next generation to enjoy,
1594.089	and if we don't change things,
1595.954	if we don't stand up to make the changes
1599.087	we need to do to keep the Internet safe,
1602.294	not just for us but for everyone,
1605.062	we're going to lose that,
1606.527	and that would be a tremendous loss,
1607.78	not just for us, but for the world.
1610.127	CA: Well, I have heard similar language recently
1612.2	from the founder of the world wide web,
1614.048	who I actually think is with us, Sir Tim Berners-Lee.
1618.565	Tim, actually, would you like to come up and say,
1621.269	do we have a microphone for Tim?
1623.14	(Applause)
1625.507	Tim, good to see you. Come up there.
1632.582	Which camp are you in, by the way,
1635.019	traitor, hero? I have a theory on this, but --
1638.519	Tim Berners-Lee: I've given much longer
1641.213	answers to that question, but hero,
1644.268	if I have to make the choice between the two.
1647.67	CA: And Ed, I think you've read
1651.003	the proposal that Sir Tim has talked about
1653.087	about a new Magna Carta to take back the Internet.
1656.055	Is that something that makes sense?
1658.157	ES: Absolutely. I mean, my generation, I grew up
1661.798	not just thinking about the Internet,
1663.857	but I grew up in the Internet,
1666.221	and although I never expected to have the chance
1670.881	to defend it in such a direct and practical manner
1676.428	and to embody it in this unusual,
1680.224	almost avatar manner,
1682.353	I think there's something poetic about the fact that
1685.059	one of the sons of the Internet
1687.041	has actually become close to the Internet
1690.093	as a result of their political expression.
1692.579	And I believe that a Magna Carta for the Internet
1696.29	is exactly what we need.
1698.252	We need to encode our values
1701.76	not just in writing but in the structure of the Internet,
1705.107	and it's something that I hope,
1707.347	I invite everyone in the audience,
1709.87	not just here in Vancouver but around the world,
1713.12	to join and participate in.
1715.476	CA: Do you have a question for Ed?
1717.79	TBL: Well, two questions,
1719.82	a general question —
1720.944	CA: Ed, can you still hear us?
1722.739	ES: Yes, I can hear you.
1722.739	CA: Oh, he's back.
1726.255	TBL: The wiretap on your line
1727.85	got a little interfered with for a moment.
1729.756	(Laughter)
1731.409	ES: It's a little bit of an NSA problem.
1733.611	TBL: So, from the 25 years,
1737.418	stepping back and thinking,
1740.355	what would you think would be
1742.101	the best that we could achieve
1744.708	from all the discussions that we have
1746.568	about the web we want?
1749.461	ES: When we think about
1752.833	in terms of how far we can go,
1755.946	I think that's a question that's really only limited
1758.099	by what we're willing to put into it.
1760.636	I think the Internet that we've enjoyed in the past
1763.593	has been exactly what we as not just a nation
1769.151	but as a people around the world need,
1772.49	and by cooperating, by engaging not just
1776.716	the technical parts of society,
1778.12	but as you said, the users,
1780.962	the people around the world who contribute
1783.026	through the Internet, through social media,
1785.468	who just check the weather,
1787.195	who rely on it every day as a part of their life,
1789.748	to champion that.
1792.688	We'll get not just the Internet we've had,
1795.225	but a better Internet, a better now,
1798.174	something that we can use to build a future
1802.217	that'll be better not just than what we hoped for
1805.185	but anything that we could have imagined.
1807.57	CA: It's 30 years ago that TED was founded, 1984.
1813.032	A lot of the conversation since then has been
1815.037	along the lines that
1817.091	actually George Orwell got it wrong.
1818.994	It's not Big Brother watching us.
1820.713	We, through the power of the web,
1822.327	and transparency, are now watching Big Brother.
1824.691	Your revelations kind of drove a stake
1826.952	through the heart of that rather optimistic view,
1830.699	but you still believe there's a way of doing something
1834.119	about that.
1835.988	And you do too.
1837.728	ES: Right, so there is an argument to be made
1843.896	that the powers of Big Brother
1843.896	have increased enormously.
1847.493	There was a recent legal article at Yale
1851.822	that established something called
1851.822	the Bankston-Soltani Principle,
1855.553	which is that our expectation of privacy is violated
1860.782	when the capabilities of government surveillance
1862.651	have become cheaper by an order of magnitude,
1865.846	and each time that occurs, we need to revisit
1868.568	and rebalance our privacy rights.
1871.621	Now, that hasn't happened since
1873.611	the government's surveillance powers
1875.709	have increased by several orders of magnitude,
1878.489	and that's why we're in the
1878.489	problem that we're in today,
1881.463	but there is still hope,
1885.275	because the power of individuals
1887.411	have also been increased by technology.
1890.018	I am living proof
1892.019	that an individual can go head to head
1894.181	against the most powerful adversaries
1896.499	and the most powerful intelligence agencies
1898.82	around the world and win,
1902.58	and I think that's something
1904.24	that we need to take hope from,
1906.663	and we need to build on
1907.84	to make it accessible not just to technical experts
1910.277	but to ordinary citizens around the world.
1912.794	Journalism is not a crime,
1914.461	communication is not a crime,
1916.251	and we should not be monitored
1916.251	in our everyday activities.
1919.195	CA: I'm not quite sure how
1919.195	you shake the hand of a bot,
1921.924	but I imagine it's, this is the hand right here.
1921.924	TBL: That'll come very soon.
1927.814	ES: Nice to meet you,
1928.937	and I hope my beam looks as nice
1930.984	as my view of you guys does.
1933.328	CA: Thank you, Tim.
1936.048	(Applause)
1941.78	I mean, The New York Times
1941.78	recently called for an amnesty for you.
1945.832	Would you welcome the chance
1945.832	to come back to America?
1950.058	ES: Absolutely. There's really no question,
1953.943	the principles that have been the foundation
1956.525	of this project
1958.918	have been the public interest
1962.998	and the principles that underly
1965.941	the journalistic establishment in the United States
1969.217	and around the world,
1971.663	and I think if the press is now saying,
1976.508	we support this,
1978.59	this is something that needed to happen,
1980.678	that's a powerful argument,
1980.678	but it's not the final argument,
1983.322	and I think that's something
1983.322	that public should decide.
1986.035	But at the same time,
1987.877	the government has hinted that they want
1989.423	some kind of deal,
1991.267	that they want me to compromise
1993.381	the journalists with which I've been working,
1995.556	to come back,
1996.989	and I want to make it very clear
1999.542	that I did not do this to be safe.
2002.268	I did this to do what was right,
2004.536	and I'm not going to stop my work
2006.763	in the public interest
2008.137	just to benefit myself.
2010.926	(Applause)
2016.704	CA: In the meantime,
2018.623	courtesy of the Internet and this technology,
2022.391	you're here, back in North America,
2024.041	not quite the U.S., Canada, in this form.
2028.057	I'm curious, how does that feel?
2032.951	ES: Canada is different than what I expected.
2035.089	It's a lot warmer.
2037.214	(Laughter)
2042.921	"CA: At TED, the mission is ""ideas worth spreading."""
2046.177	If you could encapsulate it in a single idea,
2048.375	what is your idea worth spreading
2050.59	right now at this moment?
2054.665	ES: I would say the last year has been a reminder
2058.315	that democracy may die behind closed doors,
2061.918	but we as individuals are born
2063.822	behind those same closed doors,
2066.471	and we don't have to give up
2068.836	our privacy to have good government.
2072.069	We don't have to give up our liberty
2074.159	to have security.
2075.938	And I think by working together
2078.726	we can have both open government
2081.051	and private lives,
2082.988	and I look forward to working with everyone
2084.761	around the world to see that happen.
2087.3	Thank you very much.
2088.638	CA: Ed, thank you.
