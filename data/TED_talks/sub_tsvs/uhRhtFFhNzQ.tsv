12.774	Right now
14.515	you have a movie playing inside your head.
17.989	It's an amazing multi-track movie.
20.516	It has 3D vision and surround sound
23.84	for what you're seeing and hearing right now,
26.476	but that's just the start of it.
28.795	Your movie has smell and taste and touch.
33.978	It has a sense of your body,
36.53	pain, hunger, orgasms.
40.849	It has emotions,
42.89	anger and happiness.
46.426	It has memories, like scenes from your childhood
50.22	playing before you.
52.92	And it has this constant voiceover narrative
57.375	in your stream of conscious thinking.
61.751	At the heart of this movie is you
66.824	experiencing all this directly.
71.189	This movie is your stream of consciousness,
76.881	the subject of experience
78.188	of the mind and the world.
83.326	Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts
85.631	of human existence.
87.648	Each of us is conscious.
90.58	We all have our own inner movie,
93.309	you and you and you.
96.04	There's nothing we know about more directly.
99.76	At least, I know about my consciousness directly.
103.232	I can't be certain that you guys are conscious.
107.23	Consciousness also is what makes life worth living.
110.658	If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives
114.358	would have meaning or value.
117.723	But at the same time, it's the most
118.889	mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
123.059	Why are we conscious?
126.432	Why do we have these inner movies?
127.973	Why aren't we just robots
130.226	who process all this input,
132.469	produce all that output,
134.486	without experiencing the inner movie at all?
138.341	Right now, nobody knows the answers
140.85	to those questions.
142.596	I'm going to suggest that to integrate consciousness
146.305	into science, some radical ideas may be needed.
151	Some people say a science of consciousness
153.966	is impossible.
155.918	Science, by its nature, is objective.
159.686	Consciousness, by its nature, is subjective.
163.111	So there can never be a science of consciousness.
167.56	For much of the 20th century, that view held sway.
170.78	Psychologists studied behavior objectively,
174.598	neuroscientists studied the brain objectively,
178.66	and nobody even mentioned consciousness.
182.21	Even 30 years ago, when TED got started,
184.966	there was very little scientific work
187.348	on consciousness.
189.9	Now, about 20 years ago,
191.605	all that began to change.
194.578	Neuroscientists like Francis Crick
197.355	and physicists like Roger Penrose
200.111	said now is the time for science
202.351	to attack consciousness.
205.127	And since then, there's been a real explosion,
207.447	a flowering of scientific work
209.784	on consciousness.
211.048	And this work has been wonderful. It's been great.
213.087	But it also has some fundamental
215.175	limitations so far.
219	The centerpiece
220.658	of the science of consciousness in recent years
223.478	has been the search for correlations,
225.973	correlations between certain areas of the brain
229.102	and certain states of consciousness.
233.12	We saw some of this kind of work
234.21	from Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work
235.97	she presented just a few minutes ago.
239.246	Now we understand much better, for example,
242.809	the kinds of brain areas that go along with
245.126	the conscious experience of seeing faces
248.497	or of feeling pain
251.617	or of feeling happy.
254.106	But this is still a science of correlations.
256.922	It's not a science of explanations.
260.278	We know that these brain areas
262.901	go along with certain kinds of conscious experience,
266.825	but we don't know why they do.
270.461	I like to put this by saying
272.786	that this kind of work from neuroscience
276.183	is answering some of the questions
277.929	we want answered about consciousness,
279.734	the questions about what certain brain areas do
283.507	and what they correlate with.
285.616	But in a certain sense, those are the easy problems.
288.772	No knock on the neuroscientists.
291.213	There are no truly easy
291.213	problems with consciousness.
293.834	But it doesn't address the real mystery
298.425	at the core of this subject:
300.355	why is it that all that physical processing in a brain
304.575	should be accompanied by consciousness at all?
307.5	Why is there this inner subjective movie?
310.706	Right now, we don't really have a bead on that.
313.96	And you might say,
315.993	let's just give neuroscience a few years.
319.548	It'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon
323.328	like traffic jams, like hurricanes,
328.21	like life, and we'll figure it out.
330.831	The classical cases of emergence
332.902	are all cases of emergent behavior,
336.28	how a traffic jam behaves,
338.627	how a hurricane functions,
340.123	how a living organism reproduces
342.316	and adapts and metabolizes,
345.905	all questions about objective functioning.
348.188	You could apply that to the human brain
351.01	in explaining some of the behaviors
352.519	and the functions of the human brain
354.792	as emergent phenomena:
355.951	how we walk, how we talk, how we play chess,
360.349	all these questions about behavior.
362.239	But when it comes to consciousness,
364.366	questions about behavior
366.255	are among the easy problems.
369.18	When it comes to the hard problem,
370.777	that's the question of why is it
373.154	that all this behavior
374.965	is accompanied by subjective experience?
377.81	And here, the standard paradigm
379.565	of emergence,
381.411	even the standard paradigms of neuroscience,
384.358	don't really, so far, have that much to say.
388.801	Now, I'm a scientific materialist at heart.
392.446	I want a scientific theory of consciousness
396.473	that works,
398.802	and for a long time, I banged my head
401.209	against the wall
402.65	looking for a theory of consciousness
404.787	in purely physical terms
406.543	that would work.
407.87	But I eventually came to the conclusion
409.613	that that just didn't work for systematic reasons.
413.798	It's a long story,
415.733	but the core idea is just that what you get
418.45	from purely reductionist explanations
420.79	in physical terms, in brain-based terms,
423.434	is stories about the functioning of a system,
425.549	its structure, its dynamics,
427.675	the behavior it produces,
429.667	great for solving the easy problems —
431.747	how we behave, how we function —
434.245	but when it comes to subjective experience —
437.698	why does all this feel like
437.698	something from the inside? —
441.259	that's something fundamentally new,
443.334	and it's always a further question.
447.227	So I think we're at a kind of impasse here.
452.64	We've got this wonderful, great chain of explanation,
455.855	we're used to it, where physics explains chemistry,
459.455	chemistry explains biology,
462.695	biology explains parts of psychology.
466.542	But consciousness
468	doesn't seem to fit into this picture.
470.771	On the one hand, it's a datum
472.661	that we're conscious.
474.63	On the other hand, we don't know how
475.916	to accommodate it into our
475.916	scientific view of the world.
479.894	So I think consciousness right now
481.841	is a kind of anomaly,
484.304	one that we need to integrate
486.34	into our view of the world, but we don't yet see how.
490.24	Faced with an anomaly like this,
492.168	radical ideas may be needed,
495.407	and I think that we may need one or two ideas
498.412	that initially seem crazy
500.852	before we can come to grips with consciousness
503.788	scientifically.
505.88	Now, there are a few candidates
507.479	for what those crazy ideas might be.
509.975	My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
514.317	His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem
516.714	of consciousness.
518.457	The whole idea of the inner subjective movie
521.82	involves a kind of illusion or confusion.
526.432	Actually, all we've got to do is explain
528.33	the objective functions, the behaviors of the brain,
531.337	and then we've explained everything
533.362	that needs to be explained.
535.837	Well I say, more power to him.
538.446	That's the kind of radical idea
540.46	that we need to explore
542.384	if you want to have a purely reductionist
544.723	brain-based theory of consciousness.
548.273	At the same time, for me and for many other people,
550.344	that view is a bit too close to simply
552.171	denying the datum of consciousness
554.192	to be satisfactory.
555.695	So I go in a different direction.
558.763	In the time remaining,
559.949	I want to explore two crazy ideas
562.948	that I think may have some promise.
566.665	The first crazy idea
568.285	is that consciousness is fundamental.
572.91	Physicists sometimes take
572.91	some aspects of the universe
575.751	as fundamental building blocks:
577.911	space and time and mass.
581.66	They postulate fundamental laws governing them,
585.27	like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics.
589.16	These fundamental properties and laws
591.47	aren't explained in terms of anything more basic.
594.687	Rather, they're taken as primitive,
597.427	and you build up the world from there.
600.806	Now sometimes, the list of fundamentals expands.
605.905	In the 19th century, Maxwell figured out
608.362	that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena
611.53	in terms of the existing fundamentals —
613.881	space, time, mass, Newton's laws —
616.95	so he postulated fundamental laws
619.521	of electromagnetism
621.335	and postulated electric charge
623.746	as a fundamental element
625.514	that those laws govern.
628.473	I think that's the situation we're in
631.756	with consciousness.
633.366	If you can't explain consciousness
635.851	in terms of the existing fundamentals —
638.269	space, time, mass, charge —
640.94	then as a matter of logic,
640.94	you need to expand the list.
644.37	The natural thing to do is to postulate
646.846	consciousness itself as something fundamental,
650.102	a fundamental building block of nature.
653.134	This doesn't mean you suddenly
653.134	can't do science with it.
656.102	This opens up the way for you to do science with it.
659.7	What we then need is to study
661.604	the fundamental laws governing consciousness,
664.557	the laws that connect consciousness
666.937	to other fundamentals: space, time, mass,
669.738	physical processes.
672.674	Physicists sometimes say
674.856	that we want fundamental laws so simple
677.736	that we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.
681.538	Well I think something like that is the situation
683.259	we're in with consciousness.
685.127	We want to find fundamental laws so simple
687.877	we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.
689.964	We don't know what those laws are yet,
691.539	but that's what we're after.
695.566	The second crazy idea
697.983	is that consciousness might be universal.
701.461	Every system might have some degree
704.522	of consciousness.
708.247	This view is sometimes called panpsychism:
711.208	pan for all, psych for mind,
714.21	every system is conscious,
715.981	not just humans, dogs, mice, flies,
720.228	but even Rob Knight's microbes,
722.805	elementary particles.
724.992	Even a photon has some degree of consciousness.
727.705	The idea is not that photons are intelligent
731.484	or thinking.
732.561	It's not that a photon
733.991	is wracked with angst
735.436	"because it's thinking, ""Aww, I'm always"
735.436	buzzing around near the speed of light.
738.728	"I never get to slow down and smell the roses."""
741.72	No, not like that.
743.864	But the thought is maybe photons might have
746.912	some element of raw, subjective feeling,
749.535	some primitive precursor to consciousness.
753.687	This may sound a bit kooky to you.
756.541	I mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing?
759.324	Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea,
762.884	that consciousness is fundamental.
765.03	If it's fundamental, like space and time and mass,
769.405	it's natural to suppose that it might be universal too,
772.07	the way they are.
773.97	It's also worth noting that although the idea
775.919	seems counterintuitive to us,
777.943	it's much less counterintuitive to people
780.687	from different cultures,
782.418	where the human mind is seen as much more
783.938	continuous with nature.
787.01	A deeper motivation comes from the idea that
790.744	perhaps the most simple and powerful way
792.753	to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness
794.987	to physical processing
796.967	is to link consciousness to information.
800.062	Wherever there's information processing,
802.073	there's consciousness.
803.138	Complex information processing, like in a human,
805.688	complex consciousness.
807.22	Simple information processing,
809.349	simple consciousness.
811.307	A really exciting thing is in recent years
813.638	a neuroscientist, Giulio Tononi,
816.903	has taken this kind of theory
818.146	and developed it rigorously
820.221	with a mathematical theory.
822.07	He has a mathematical measure
823.587	of information integration
825.317	which he calls phi,
827.236	measuring the amount of information
828.843	integrated in a system.
830.463	And he supposes that phi goes along
832.832	with consciousness.
834.27	So in a human brain,
835.591	incredibly large amount of information integration,
838.11	high degree of phi,
840.144	a whole lot of consciousness.
841.693	In a mouse, medium degree
841.693	of information integration,
845.386	still pretty significant,
846.405	pretty serious amount of consciousness.
848.43	But as you go down to worms,
850.695	microbes, particles,
854.172	the amount of phi falls off.
855.706	The amount of information integration falls off,
858.139	but it's still non-zero.
859.587	On Tononi's theory,
861.526	there's still going to be a non-zero degree
863.733	of consciousness.
865.562	In effect, he's proposing a fundamental law
868.101	of consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.
871.485	Now, I don't know if this theory is right,
874.107	but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now
877.318	in the science of consciousness,
878.704	and it's been used to integrate a whole range
880.935	of scientific data,
883.322	and it does have a nice property
883.322	that it is in fact simple enough
885.565	you can write it on the front of a t-shirt.
889.06	Another final motivation is that
891.685	panpsychism might help us to integrate
893.736	consciousness into the physical world.
896.95	Physicists and philosophers have often observed
900.127	that physics is curiously abstract.
902.568	It describes the structure of reality
904.716	using a bunch of equations,
906.8	but it doesn't tell us about the reality
909.824	that underlies it.
911.392	As Stephen Hawking puts it,
913.289	what puts the fire into the equations?
917.343	Well, on the panpsychist view,
919.961	you can leave the equations of physics as they are,
922.6	but you can take them to be describing
924.164	the flux of consciousness.
925.838	That's what physics really is ultimately doing,
927.876	describing the flux of consciousness.
930.205	On this view, it's consciousness
931.858	that puts the fire into the equations.
936.104	On that view, consciousness doesn't dangle
937.764	outside the physical world
939.44	as some kind of extra.
940.858	It's there right at its heart.
944.314	This view, I think, the panpsychist view,
947.188	has the potential to transfigure our relationship
950.489	to nature,
951.984	and it may have some pretty serious social
954.219	and ethical consequences.
957.912	Some of these may be counterintuitive.
960.071	I used to think I shouldn't eat anything
963.142	which is conscious,
965.604	so therefore I should be vegetarian.
968.208	Now, if you're a panpsychist and you take that view,
970.775	you're going to go very hungry.
973.505	So I think when you think about it,
974.793	this tends to transfigure your views,
976.96	whereas what matters for ethical purposes
979.203	and moral considerations,
980.477	not so much the fact of consciousness,
983.554	but the degree and the complexity of consciousness.
987.51	It's also natural to ask about consciousness
989.448	in other systems, like computers.
992.498	What about the artificially intelligent system
994.287	"in the movie ""Her,"" Samantha?"
997.729	Is she conscious?
999.129	Well, if you take the informational,
1000.56	panpsychist view,
1001.74	she certainly has complicated information processing
1005.211	and integration,
1006.632	so the answer is very likely yes, she is conscious.
1009.299	If that's right, it raises pretty serious
1012.237	ethical issues about both the ethics
1014.602	of developing intelligent computer systems
1018.123	and the ethics of turning them off.
1020.859	Finally, you might ask about the consciousness
1023.359	of whole groups,
1025.241	the planet.
1027.078	Does Canada have its own consciousness?
1030.001	Or at a more local level,
1032.1	does an integrated group
1033.308	like the audience at a TED conference,
1035.571	are we right now having a
1035.571	collective TED consciousness,
1039.02	an inner movie
1040.513	for this collective TED group
1043.319	which is distinct from the inner movies
1044.999	of each of our parts?
1046.088	I don't know the answer to that question,
1048.253	but I think it's at least one
1049.624	worth taking seriously.
1052.098	Okay, so this panpsychist vision,
1054.435	it is a radical one,
1056.248	and I don't know that it's correct.
1058.462	I'm actually more confident about
1060.315	the first crazy idea,
1061.948	that consciousness is fundamental,
1064.117	than about the second one,
1065.92	that it's universal.
1068.141	I mean, the view raises any number of questions,
1070.219	has any number of challenges,
1071.76	like how do those little bits
1073.12	of consciousness add up
1074.86	to the kind of complex consciousness
1077.157	we know and love.
1079.48	If we can answer those questions,
1080.94	then I think we're going to be well on our way
1082.445	to a serious theory of consciousness.
1085.532	If not, well, this is the hardest problem perhaps
1088.92	in science and philosophy.
1090.764	We can't expect to solve it overnight.
1094.209	But I do think we're going to figure it out eventually.
1097.749	Understanding consciousness is a real key, I think,
1100.736	both to understanding the universe
1103.188	and to understanding ourselves.
1105.718	It may just take the right crazy idea.
1108.621	Thank you.
1110.612	(Applause)
