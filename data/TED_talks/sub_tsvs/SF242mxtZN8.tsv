12.822	So over the long course of human history,
16.257	the infectious disease that's killed more humans
18.749	than any other is malaria.
21.235	It's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos,
24.096	and it's probably our oldest scourge.
26.305	We may have had malaria since we evolved from the apes.
30.192	And to this day, malaria takes a huge toll on our species.
33.794	We've got 300 million cases a year
36.245	and over half a million deaths.
39.237	Now this really makes no sense.
42.202	We've known how to cure malaria
44.854	since the 1600s.
46.494	That's when Jesuit missionaries in Peru
48.791	discovered the bark of the cinchona tree,
51.693	and inside that bark was quinine,
53.566	still an effective cure for malaria to this day.
56.904	So we've known how to cure malaria for centuries.
59.805	We've known how to prevent malaria since 1897.
62.989	That's when the British army surgeon Ronald Ross
65.262	discovered that it was mosquitos that carried malaria,
68.62	not bad air or miasmas, as was previously thought.
72.812	So malaria should be a relatively simple disease to solve,
78.095	and yet to this day, hundreds of thousands of people
82.025	are going to die from the bite of a mosquito.
85.5	Why is that?
86.745	This is a question that's
88.275	personally intrigued me for a long time.
90.43	I grew up as the daughter of Indian immigrants
93.189	visiting my cousins in India every summer,
95.448	and because I had no immunity to the local malarias,
98.636	I was made to sleep under this hot, sweaty mosquito net every night
102.87	while my cousins, they were allowed to sleep
104.561	out on the terrace and have
105.79	this nice, cool night breeze wafting over them.
108.552	And I really hated the mosquitos for that.
112.076	But at the same time, I come from a Jain family,
115.444	and Jainism is a religion that espouses
117.758	a very extreme form of nonviolence.
120.896	So Jains are not supposed to eat meat.
124.224	We're not supposed to walk on grass,
126.081	because you could, you know,
127.342	inadvertently kill some insects when you walk on grass.
129.242	We're certainly not supposed to swat mosquitos.
132.019	So the fearsome power of this little insect
135.735	was apparent to me from a very young age,
137.714	and it's one reason why I spent five years as a journalist
140.985	trying to understand, why has malaria
143.673	been such a horrible scourge for all of us for so very long?
148.213	And I think there's three main reasons why.
150.87	Those three reasons add up to the fourth reason,
153.338	which is probably the biggest reason of all.
156.149	The first reason is certainly scientific.
159.11	This little parasite that causes malaria,
161.425	it's probably one of the most complex
163.352	and wily pathogens known to humankind.
165.943	It lives half its life inside the cold-blooded mosquito
169.283	and half its life inside the warm-blooded human.
173.685	These two environments are totally different,
176.683	but not only that, they're both utterly hostile.
179.699	So the insect is continually trying to fight off the parasite,
183.706	and so is the human body continually trying to fight it off.
186.667	This little creature survives under siege like that,
190.417	but not only does it survive, it has thrived.
193.492	It has spread. It has more ways to evade attack than we know.
197.814	It's a shape-shifter, for one thing.
199.928	Just as a caterpillar turns into a butterfly,
203.087	the malaria parasite transforms itself like that
205.726	seven times in its life cycle.
208.949	And each of those life stages not only looks totally different from each other,
213.206	they have totally different physiology.
216.27	So say you came up with some great drug
218.262	that worked against one stage of the parasite's life cycle.
221.202	It might do nothing at all to any of the other stages.
224.667	It can hide in our bodies, undetected,
227.53	unbeknownst to us, for days, for weeks,
229.894	for months, for years, in some cases even decades.
233.693	So the parasite is a very big scientific challenge to tackle,
238.077	but so is the mosquito that carries the parasite.
241.282	Only about 12 species of mosquitos
243.58	carry most of the world's malaria,
245.514	and we know quite a bit about the kinds of
247.99	watery habitats that they specialize in.
250.915	So you might think, then, well, why don't we just
253.197	avoid the places where the killer mosquitos live? Right?
256.353	We could avoid the places where the killer grizzly bears live
258.631	and we avoid the places where the killer crocodiles live.
261.39	But say you live in the tropics
264.62	and you walk outside your hut one day
267.893	and you leave some footprints in the soft dirt
269.915	around your home.
271.838	Or say your cow does, or say your pig does,
275.068	and then, say, it rains,
277.202	and that footprint fills up with a little bit of water.
279.57	That's it. You've created the perfect
281.651	malarial mosquito habitat that's right outside your door.
285.229	So it's not easy for us to extricate ourselves from these insects.
288.091	We kind of create places that they love to live
290.725	just by living our own lives.
292.724	So there's a huge scientific challenge,
294.103	but there's a huge economic challenge too.
296.31	Malaria occurs in some of the poorest
298.245	and most remote places on Earth,
300.184	and there's a reason for that.
302.029	If you're poor, you're more likely to get malaria.
304.729	If you're poor, you're more likely to live
306.882	in rudimentary housing on marginal land that's poorly drained.
310.951	These are places where mosquitos breed.
313.54	You're less likely to have door screens or window screens.
317.14	You're less likely to have electricity
319.043	and all the indoor activities that electricity makes possible,
322.049	so you're outside more.
323.282	You're getting bitten by mosquitos more.
325.614	So poverty causes malaria,
327.239	but what we also know now is that malaria itself
330.272	causes poverty.
331.919	For one thing, it strikes hardest during harvest season,
334.57	so exactly when farmers need to be out in the fields
337.326	collecting their crops, they're home sick with a fever.
341.235	But it also predisposes people to death
344.096	from all other causes.
345.881	So this has happened historically.
347.241	We've been able to take malaria out of a society.
350.623	Everything else stays the same,
352.08	so we still have bad food, bad water, bad sanitation,
354.755	all the things that make people sick.
356.516	But just if you take malaria out,
358.66	deaths from everything else go down.
362.472	And the economist Jeff Sachs has actually quantified
365.183	what this means for a society.
367.368	What it means is, if you have malaria in your society,
370.122	your economic growth is depressed
372.583	by 1.3 percent every year,
376.553	year after year after year, just this one disease alone.
380.352	So this poses a huge economic challenge,
382.916	because say you do come up with your great drug
385.1	or your great vaccine -- how do you deliver it
387.31	in a place where there's no roads,
389.88	there's no infrastructure,
391.073	there's no electricity for refrigeration to keep things cold,
394.407	there's no clinics, there's no clinicians
397.127	to deliver these things where they're needed?
399.661	So there's a huge economic challenge in taming malaria.
403.664	But along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge,
406.72	there's also a cultural challenge,
408.532	and this is probably the part about malaria
411.917	that people don't like to talk about.
414.218	And it's the paradox that the people
416.929	who have the most malaria in the world
418.737	tend to care about it the least.
421.317	This has been the finding of medical anthropologists again and again.
424.729	They ask people in malarious parts of the world,
427.496	"""What do you think about malaria?"""
429.552	"And they don't say, ""It's a killer disease. We're scared of it."""
433.461	"They say, ""Malaria is a normal problem of life."""
438.799	And that was certainly my personal experience.
440.565	When I told my relatives in India
442.584	that I was writing a book about malaria,
444.068	they kind of looked at me like
446.035	I told them I was writing a book about warts or something.
448.736	Like, why would you write about something so boring,
451.783	so ordinary? You know?
453.449	And it's simple risk perception, really.
456.177	A child in Malawi, for example,
458.612	she might have 12 episodes of malaria before the age of two,
463.424	but if she survives,
465.477	she'll continue to get malaria throughout her life,
468.091	but she's much less likely to die of it.
470.814	And so in her lived experience,
472.766	malaria is something that comes and goes.
476.097	And that's actually true for most of the world's malaria.
478.127	Most of the world's malaria comes and goes on its own.
481.704	It's just, there's so much malaria
484.828	that this tiny fraction of cases that end in death
488.599	add up to this big, huge number.
491.56	So I think people in malarious parts of the world
493.553	must think of malaria the way
495.075	those of us who live in the temperate world
496.734	think of cold and flu. Right?
498.985	Cold and flu have a huge burden on our societies
502.391	and on our own lives,
504.072	but we don't really even take
505.336	the most rudimentary precautions against it because
507.878	we consider it normal to get cold and flu
510.599	during cold and flu season.
512.836	And so this poses a huge cultural challenge in taming malaria,
517.248	because if people think it's normal to have malaria,
521.022	then how do you get them to run to the doctor
524.48	to get diagnosed, to pick up their prescription,
527.626	to get it filled, to take the drugs,
529.148	to put on the repellents, to tuck in the bed nets?
532.627	This is a huge cultural challenge in taming this disease.
537.294	So take all that together.
538.796	We've got a disease. It's scientifically complicated,
543.248	it's economically challenging to deal with,
545.676	and it's one for which the people who stand
547.321	to benefit the most care about it the least.
549.625	And that adds up to the biggest problem of all,
551.713	which, of course, is the political problem.
554.662	How do you get a political leader to do anything
557.52	about a problem like this?
559.581	And the answer is, historically, you don't.
564.206	Most malarious societies throughout history
566.339	have simply lived with the disease.
568.455	So the main attacks on malaria have come
570.458	from outside of malarious societies,
573.082	from people who aren't constrained
574.876	by these rather paralyzing politics.
577.855	But this, I think, introduces a whole host of other kinds of difficulties.
581.15	The first concerted attack against malaria
583.57	started in the 1950s.
585.316	It was the brainchild of the U.S. State Department.
588.406	And this effort well understood the economic challenge.
591.443	They knew they had to focus on cheap, easy-to-use tools,
594.924	and they focused on DDT.
596.699	They understood the cultural challenge.
598.138	In fact, their rather patronizing view was that
601.143	people at risk of malaria shouldn't be asked to do anything at all.
604.046	Everything should be done to them and for them.
607.768	But they greatly underestimated the scientific challenge.
610.888	They had so much faith in their tools
613.215	that they stopped doing malaria research.
616.206	And so when those tools started to fail,
618.674	and public opinion started to turn against those tools,
621.374	they had no scientific expertise to figure out what to do.
625.568	The whole campaign crashed, malaria resurged back,
629.019	but now it was even worse than before
630.833	because it was corralled into the hardest-to-reach places
633.594	in the most difficult-to-control forms.
636.78	One WHO official at the time actually called that whole campaign
640.079	"""one of the greatest mistakes ever made in public health."""
645.136	The latest effort to tame malaria started in the late 1990s.
647.643	It's similarly directed and financed primarily
651.355	from outside of malarious societies.
653.503	Now this effort well understands the scientific challenge.
656.007	They are doing tons of malaria research.
658.228	And they understand the economic challenge too.
660.681	They're focusing on very cheap, very easy-to-use tools.
664.241	But now, I think, the dilemma is the cultural challenge.
668.133	The centerpiece of the current effort is the bed net.
671.767	It's treated with insecticides.
673.543	This thing has been distributed across the malarious world
675.913	by the millions.
677.346	And when you think about the bed net,
679.578	it's sort of a surgical intervention.
682.137	You know, it doesn't really have any value
684.283	to a family with malaria except that it helps prevent malaria.
687.946	And yet we're asking people to use these nets every night.
691.955	They have to sleep under them every night.
693.232	That's the only way they are effective.
695.269	And they have to do that
696.622	even if the net blocks the breeze,
699.708	even if they might have to get up in the middle of the night
702.853	and relieve themselves,
704.387	even if they might have to move all their furnishings
706.636	to put this thing up,
708.103	even if, you know, they might live in a round hut
710.956	in which it's difficult to string up a square net.
714.693	Now that's no big deal if you're fighting a killer disease.
719.631	I mean, these are minor inconveniences.
721.962	But that's not how people with malaria think of malaria.
725.801	So for them, the calculus must be quite different.
730.681	Imagine, for example, if a bunch of well-meaning Kenyans
734.599	came up to those of us in the temperate world and said,
736.68	"""You know, you people have a lot of cold and flu."
739.502	We've designed this great, easy-to-use, cheap tool,
742.63	we're going to give it to you for free.
743.7	It's called a face mask,
745.133	and all you need to do is
749.006	wear it every day during cold and flu season
751.416	"when you go to school and when you go to work."""
754.185	Would we do that?
756.115	And I wonder if that's how people
758.251	in the malarious world thought of those nets
760.317	when they first received them?
762.02	Indeed, we know from studies
765.418	that only 20 percent of the bed nets
768.096	that were first distributed were actually used.
771.264	And even that's probably an overestimate,
772.975	because the same people who distributed the nets
775.397	went back and asked the recipients,
776.888	"""Oh, did you use that net I gave you?"""
779.361	Which is like your Aunt Jane asking you,
781.973	"""Oh, did you use that vase I gave you for Christmas?"""
784.934	So it's probably an overestimate.
786.8	But that's not an insurmountable problem.
790.124	We can do more education,
791.954	we can try to convince these people to use the nets.
794.629	And that's what happening now.
795.904	We're throwing a lot more time and money
797.608	into workshops and trainings and musicals and plays
802.125	and school meetings,
804.538	all these things to convince people
806.833	to use the nets we gave you.
809.317	And that might work.
811.457	But it takes time. It takes money.
814.135	It takes resources. It takes infrastructure.
816.915	It takes all the things that that cheap,
819.597	easy-to-use bed net was not supposed to be.
822.376	So it's difficult to attack malaria from inside malarious societies,
825.78	but it's equally tricky when we try to attack it
828.318	from outside of those societies.
831.128	We end up imposing our own priorities
832.915	on the people of the malarious world.
834.459	That's exactly what we did in the 1950s,
837.253	and that effort backfired.
839.131	I would argue today,
840.762	when we are distributing tools that we've designed
844.992	and that don't necessarily make sense in people's lives,
848.745	we run the risk of making the same mistake again.
852.298	That's not to say that malaria is unconquerable,
854.106	because I think it is,
855.569	but what if we attacked this disease
857.777	according to the priorities of the people who lived with it?
861.32	Take the example of England and the United States.
863.756	We had malaria in those countries for hundreds of years,
866.927	and we got rid of it completely,
869.085	not because we attacked malaria. We didn't.
872.094	We attacked bad roads and bad houses
876.201	and bad drainage and lack of electricity and rural poverty.
881.083	We attacked the malarious way of life,
884.4	and by doing that, we slowly built malaria out.
890.12	Now attacking the malarious way of life,
891.758	this is something -- these are things people care about today.
895.32	And attacking the malarious way of life,
897.707	it's not fast, it's not cheap, it's not easy,
902.466	but I think it's the only lasting way forward.
905.534	Thank you so much.
906.827	(Applause)
