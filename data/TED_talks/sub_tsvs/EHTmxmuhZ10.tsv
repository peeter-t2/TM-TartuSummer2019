12.586	I'm going to talk a little bit about strategy
14.649	and its relationship with technology.
18.823	We tend to think of business strategy
21.718	as being a rather abstract body
23.681	of essentially economic thought,
25.396	perhaps rather timeless.
27.026	I'm going to argue that, in fact,
28.966	business strategy has always been premised
31.521	on assumptions about technology,
33.94	that those assumptions are changing,
35.913	and, in fact, changing quite dramatically,
38.63	and that therefore what that will drive us to
41.702	is a different concept of what we mean
44.605	by business strategy.
47.043	Let me start, if I may,
48.524	with a little bit of history.
51.294	The idea of strategy in business
53.038	owes its origins to two intellectual giants:
56.338	Bruce Henderson, the founder of BCG,
58.472	and Michael Porter, professor
58.472	at the Harvard Business School.
62.244	Henderson's central idea was what you might call
65.076	the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass
68.067	against weakness, of overwhelming the enemy.
70.936	What Henderson recognized was that,
72.729	in the business world,
74.125	there are many phenomena which are characterized
76.78	by what economists would call increasing returns --
78.815	scale, experience.
80.178	The more you do of something,
82.052	disproportionately the better you get.
84.449	And therefore he found a logic for investing
87.412	in such kinds of overwhelming mass
90.154	in order to achieve competitive advantage.
92.707	And that was the first introduction
94.775	of essentially a military concept of strategy
97.439	into the business world.
100.421	Porter agreed with that premise,
103.156	but he qualified it.
104.707	He pointed out, correctly, that that's all very well,
107.696	but businesses actually have multiple steps to them.
111.571	They have different components,
113.144	and each of those components might be driven
115.676	by a different kind of strategy.
117.461	A company or a business
117.461	might actually be advantaged
119.789	in some activities but disadvantaged in others.
123.267	He formed the concept of the value chain,
125.368	essentially the sequence of steps with which
128.438	a, shall we say, raw material, becomes a component,
131.59	becomes assembled into a finished product,
132.953	and then is distributed, for example,
135.594	and he argued that advantage accrued
138.01	to each of those components,
139.551	and that the advantage of the whole
141.265	was in some sense the sum or the average
143.396	of that of its parts.
145.744	And this idea of the value chain was predicated
148.321	on the recognition that
150.889	what holds a business together is transaction costs,
154.535	that in essence you need to coordinate,
156.83	organizations are more efficient at coordination
159.405	than markets, very often,
161.067	and therefore the nature and role and boundaries
164.123	of the cooperation are defined by transaction costs.
167.962	It was on those two ideas,
170.526	Henderson's idea of increasing returns
173.912	to scale and experience,
175.46	and Porter's idea of the value chain,
177.883	encompassing heterogenous elements,
179.796	that the whole edifice of business strategy
183.131	was subsequently erected.
185.908	Now what I'm going to argue is
188.337	that those premises are, in fact, being invalidated.
194.051	First of all, let's think about transaction costs.
196.605	There are really two components
196.605	to transaction costs.
199.002	One is about processing information,
199.002	and the other is about communication.
201.872	These are the economics of
201.872	processing and communicating
205.153	as they have evolved over a long period of time.
207.627	As we all know from so many contexts,
210.637	they have been radically transformed
212.893	since the days when Porter and Henderson
215.205	first formulated their theories.
217.299	In particular, since the mid-'90s,
219.365	communications costs have actually been falling
221.233	even faster than transaction costs,
223.224	which is why communication, the Internet,
225.783	has exploded in such a dramatic fashion.
230.398	Now, those falling transaction costs
232.568	have profound consequences,
234.544	because if transaction costs are the glue
236.337	that hold value chains together, and they are falling,
238.759	there is less to economize on.
240.401	There is less need for vertically
240.401	integrated organization,
243.333	and value chains at least can break up.
246.211	They needn't necessarily, but they can.
248.71	In particular, it then becomes possible for
250.85	a competitor in one business
252.616	to use their position in one step of the value chain
255.941	in order to penetrate or attack
257.773	or disintermediate the competitor in another.
260.937	That is not just an abstract proposition.
263.598	There are many very specific stories
265.277	of how that actually happened.
267.049	A poster child example was
267.049	the encyclopedia business.
270.542	The encyclopedia business
271.991	in the days of leatherbound books
274.093	was basically a distribution business.
275.797	Most of the cost was the
275.797	commission to the salesmen.
278.251	The CD-ROM and then the Internet came along,
280.877	new technologies made the distribution of knowledge
284.293	many orders of magnitude cheaper,
286.572	and the encyclopedia industry collapsed.
289.286	It's now, of course, a very familiar story.
292.118	This, in fact, more generally was the story
294.16	of the first generation of the Internet economy.
296.669	It was about falling transaction costs
298.869	breaking up value chains
300.344	and therefore allowing disintermediation,
302.973	or what we call deconstruction.
305.31	One of the questions I was occasionally asked was,
307.627	well, what's going to replace the encyclopedia
310.143	when Britannica no longer has a business model?
312.794	And it was a while before
312.794	the answer became manifest.
314.96	Now, of course, we know
314.96	what it is: it's the Wikipedia.
317.747	Now what's special about the
317.747	Wikipedia is not its distribution.
320.97	What's special about the Wikipedia
320.97	is the way it's produced.
323.374	The Wikipedia, of course, is an encyclopedia
325.614	created by its users.
328.141	And this, in fact, defines what you might call
330.021	the second decade of the Internet economy,
332.509	the decade in which the Internet as a noun
335.869	became the Internet as a verb.
337.776	It became a set of conversations,
339.645	the era in which user-generated
339.645	content and social networks
343.721	became the dominant phenomenon.
346.412	Now what that really meant
348.31	in terms of the Porter-Henderson framework
351.684	was the collapse of certain
351.684	kinds of economies of scale.
355.075	It turned out that tens of thousands
357.413	of autonomous individuals writing an encyclopedia
360.496	could do just as good a job,
362.042	and certainly a much cheaper job,
363.733	than professionals in a hierarchical organization.
366.712	So basically what was happening was that one layer
369.169	of this value chain was becoming fragmented,
372.063	as individuals could take over
373.907	where organizations were no longer needed.
377.194	But there's another question
377.194	that obviously this graph poses,
379.826	which is, okay, we've
379.826	gone through two decades --
382.109	does anything distinguish the third?
384.787	And what I'm going to argue is that indeed
386.902	something does distinguish the third,
388.407	and it maps exactly on to the kind of
390.853	Porter-Henderson logic that
390.853	we've been talking about.
393.321	And that is, about data.
395.908	If we go back to around 2000,
397.577	a lot of people were talking
397.577	about the information revolution,
399.936	and it was indeed true that the world's stock of data
402.237	was growing, indeed growing quite fast.
404.511	but it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog.
407.369	We go forward to 2007,
409.187	not only had the world's stock of data exploded,
412.372	but there'd been this massive substitution
414.892	of digital for analog.
416.907	And more important even than that,
418.776	if you look more carefully at this graph,
420.516	what you will observe is that about a half
422.536	of that digital data
424.15	is information that has an I.P. address.
426.536	It's on a server or it's on a P.C.
429.387	But having an I.P. address means that it
431.194	can be connected to any other data
433.364	that has an I.P. address.
435.227	It means it becomes possible
436.873	to put together half of the world's knowledge
439.96	in order to see patterns,
441.612	an entirely new thing.
443.969	If we run the numbers forward to today,
445.937	it probably looks something like this.
447.363	We're not really sure.
448.531	If we run the numbers forward to 2020,
450.559	we of course have an exact number, courtesy of IDC.
453.459	It's curious that the future is so much
453.459	more predictable than the present.
457.799	And what it implies is a hundredfold multiplication
462.194	in the stock of information that is connected
465.167	via an I.P. address.
467.395	Now, if the number of connections that we can make
470.856	is proportional to the number of pairs of data points,
473.996	a hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data
476.459	is a ten-thousandfold multiplication
478.562	in the number of patterns
480.127	that we can see in that data,
482.204	this just in the last 10 or 11 years.
484.864	This, I would submit, is a sea change,
487.688	a profound change in the economics
489.772	of the world that we live in.
491.723	The first human genome,
492.887	that of James Watson,
494.453	was mapped as the culmination of the
494.453	Human Genome Project in the year 2000,
498.373	and it took about 200 million dollars
500.55	and about 10 years of work to map
502.531	just one person's genomic makeup.
504.946	Since then, the costs of mapping
504.946	the genome have come down.
507.551	In fact, they've come down in recent years
509.438	very dramatically indeed,
511.112	to the point where the cost 
511.112	is now below 1,000 dollars,
513.558	and it's confidently predicted that by the year 2015
516.509	it will be below 100 dollars --
518.24	a five or six order of magnitude drop
521.436	in the cost of genomic mapping
523.381	in just a 15-year period,
525.804	an extraordinary phenomenon.
528.199	Now, in the days when mapping a genome
532.604	cost millions, or even tens of thousands,
535.613	it was basically a research enterprise.
537.591	Scientists would gather some representative people,
540.133	and they would see patterns, and they would try
541.347	and make generalizations about
541.347	human nature and disease
544.237	from the abstract patterns they find
545.828	from these particular selected individuals.
549.288	But when the genome can 
549.288	be mapped for 100 bucks,
554.469	then what happens is, it becomes retail.
556.659	It becomes above all clinical.
558.516	You go the doctor with a cold,
559.728	and if he or she hasn't done it already,
561.662	the first thing they do is map your genome,
563.9	at which point what they're now doing
565.555	is not starting from some abstract 
565.555	knowledge of genomic medicine
570.084	and trying to work out how it applies to you,
572.148	but they're starting from your particular genome.
574.717	Now think of the power of that.
576.157	Think of where that takes us
577.946	when we can combine genomic data
580.892	with clinical data
582.381	with data about drug interactions
584.34	with the kind of ambient data that devices
586.629	like our phone and medical sensors
588.388	will increasingly be collecting.
590.246	Think what happens when we collect all of that data
592.707	and we can put it together
594.18	in order to find patterns we wouldn't see before.
596.668	This, I would suggest, perhaps it will take a while,
599.579	but this will drive a revolution in medicine.
602.02	Fabulous, lots of people talk about this.
604.34	But there's one thing that
604.34	doesn't get much attention.
606.779	How is that model of colossal sharing
610.063	across all of those kinds of databases
612.709	compatible with the business models
615.201	of institutions and organizations and corporations
617.815	that are involved in this business today?
620.112	If your business is based on proprietary data,
622.888	if your competitive advantage
622.888	is defined by your data,
625.931	how on Earth is that company or is that society
629.451	in fact going to achieve the value
631.549	that's implicit in the technology? They can't.
634.554	So essentially what's happening here,
636.601	and genomics is merely one example of this,
639.245	is that technology is driving
641.559	the natural scaling of the activity
644.128	beyond the institutional boundaries within which
647.055	we have been used to thinking about it,
649.213	and in particular beyond the institutional boundaries
651.376	in terms of which business strategy
653.63	as a discipline is formulated.
657.085	The basic story here is that what used to be
660.571	vertically integrated, oligopolistic competition
664.233	among essentially similar kinds of competitors
667.024	is evolving, by one means or another,
669.483	from a vertical structure to a horizontal one.
672.844	Why is that happening?
674.559	It's happening because
674.559	transaction costs are plummeting
677.064	and because scale is polarizing.
678.992	The plummeting of transaction costs
680.734	weakens the glue that holds value chains together,
683.372	and allows them to separate.
685.04	The polarization of scale economies
686.975	towards the very small -- small is beautiful --
690.101	allows for scalable communities
692.769	to substitute for conventional corporate production.
695.886	The scaling in the opposite direction,
697.89	towards things like big data,
699.923	drive the structure of business
701.332	towards the creation of new kinds of institutions
704.055	that can achieve that scale.
706.033	But either way, the typically vertical structure
708.791	gets driven to becoming more horizontal.
711.795	The logic isn't just about big data.
714.21	If we were to look, for example,
714.21	at the telecommunications industry,
717.536	you can tell the same story about fiber optics.
719.911	If we look at the pharmaceutical industry,
722.047	or, for that matter, university research,
723.94	you can say exactly the same story
725.614	"about so-called ""big science."""
727.353	And in the opposite direction,
728.888	if we look, say, at the energy sector,
731.085	where all the talk is about how households
733.945	will be efficient producers of green energy
737.529	and efficient conservers of energy,
740.157	that is, in fact, the reverse phenomenon.
742.037	That is the fragmentation of scale
743.907	because the very small can substitute
746.261	for the traditional corporate scale.
748.855	Either way, what we are driven to
750.646	is this horizontalization of the structure of industries,
754.017	and that implies fundamental changes
756.607	in how we think about strategy.
758.669	It means, for example, that we need to think
760.701	about strategy as the curation
763.248	of these kinds of horizontal structure,
765.893	where things like business definition
767.533	and even industry definition
769.095	are actually the outcomes of strategy,
771.897	not something that the strategy presupposes.
775.078	It means, for example, we need to work out
778.234	how to accommodate collaboration
780.591	and competition simultaneously.
782.457	Think about the genome.
783.543	We need to accommodate the very large
785.321	and the very small simultaneously.
787.456	And we need industry structures
789.399	that will accommodate very,
789.399	very different motivations,
792.341	from the amateur motivations
792.341	of people in communities
794.974	to maybe the social motivations
796.947	of infrastructure built by governments,
799.283	or, for that matter, cooperative institutions
801.908	built by companies that are otherwise competing,
804.4	because that is the only way
804.4	that they can get to scale.
807.394	These kinds of transformations
809.371	render the traditional premises 
809.371	of business strategy obsolete.
813.096	They drive us into a completely new world.
815.665	They require us, whether we are
817.086	in the public sector or the private sector,
819.853	to think very fundamentally differently
822.153	about the structure of business,
823.973	and, at last, it makes strategy interesting again.
827.427	Thank you.
830.24	(Applause)
