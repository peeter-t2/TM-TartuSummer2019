13.638	Billie Jean King: Hi, everyone!
16.006	(Applause)
18.372	Thanks, Pat.
19.574	Thank you!
23.92	Getting me all wound up, now!
25.54	(Laughter)
26.57	Pat Mitchell: Good!
28.641	You know, when I was watching
28.641	the video again of the match,
32.562	you must have felt
32.562	like the fate of the world's women
37.075	was on every stroke you took.
40.446	Were you feeling that?
42.835	BJK: First of all, Bobby Riggs --
42.835	he was the former number one player,
46.178	he wasn't just some hacker, by the way.
48.204	He was one of my heroes and I admired him.
51.848	And that's the reason I beat him,
51.848	actually, because I respected him.
55.36	(Laughter)
56.483	It's true -- my mom
56.483	and especially my dad always said:
59.103	"""Respect your opponent,"
59.103	"and never underestimate them, ever."""
62.005	And he was correct.
62.005	He was absolutely correct.
65.245	But I knew it was about social change.
68.962	And I was really nervous
68.962	whenever we announced it,
72.348	and I felt like the whole world
72.348	was on my shoulders.
75.241	"And I thought, ""If I lose, it's going"
75.241	"to put women back 50 years, at least."""
80.926	Title IX had just been passed
80.926	the year before -- June 23, 1972.
85.892	And women's professional tennis --
88.49	there were nine of us who signed
88.49	a one-dollar contract in 1970 --
91.787	now remember, the match is in '73.
94.454	So we were only in our
94.454	third year of having a tour
97.638	where we could actually play,
97.638	have a place to compete and make a living.
101.922	So there were nine of us that signed
101.922	that one-dollar contract.
104.942	And our dream was for any girl,
104.942	born any place in the world --
109.935	if she was good enough --
111.517	there would be a place for her to compete
111.517	and for us to make a living.
115.652	Because before 1968,
115.652	we made 14 dollars a day,
119.436	and we were under the control
119.436	of organizations.
121.912	So we really wanted
121.912	to break away from that.
124.129	But we knew it wasn't really
124.129	about our generation so much;
126.869	we knew it was about
126.869	the future generations.
128.943	We do stand on the shoulders of the people
128.943	that came before us, there is no question.
132.972	But every generation
132.972	has the chance to make it better.
136.265	That was really on my mind.
138.706	I really wanted to start matching
138.706	the hearts and minds to Title IX.
142.349	Title IX, in case anybody doesn't know,
142.349	which a lot of people probably don't,
146.16	said that any federal funds given
146.16	to a high school, college or university,
150.462	either public or private,
152.56	had to -- finally --
152.56	give equal monies to boys and girls.
157.909	And that changed everything.
159.424	(Applause)
162.274	So you can have a law,
164.056	but it's changing the hearts and minds
164.056	to match up with it.
166.995	That's when it really rocks, totally.
169.566	So that was on my mind.
170.741	I wanted to start that change
170.741	in the hearts and minds.
174.354	But two things came out of that match.
177.17	For women: self-confidence, empowerment.
180.35	They actually had enough nerve
180.35	to ask for a raise.
183.675	Some women have waited
187.838	"I said, ""More importantly,"
187.838	"did you get it?"""
189.863	(Laughter)
190.955	And they did!
192.153	And for the men?
193.971	A lot of the men today don't realize it,
196.826	but if you're in your 50s, 60s
196.826	or whatever, late 40s,
202.255	you're the first generation of men
202.255	of the Women's Movement --
205.855	whether you like it or not!
207.171	(Laughter)
210.217	(Applause)
211.524	And for the men,
212.699	what happened for the men,
212.699	they'd come up to me --
215.338	and most times, the men are the ones
215.338	who have tears in their eyes,
218.463	it's very interesting.
219.638	"They go, ""Billie, I was very young"
219.638	when I saw that match,
223.675	and now I have a daughter.
227.193	And I am so happy I saw that
227.193	"as a young man."""
230.588	And one of those young men,
230.588	at 12 years old, was President Obama.
234.934	And he actually told me that
234.934	when I met him, he said:
237.678	"""You don't realize it,"
237.678	but I saw that match at 12.
240.66	And now I have two daughters,
242.537	and it has made a difference
242.537	"in how I raise them."""
244.987	So both men and women got a lot
244.987	out of it, but different things.
250.276	PM: And now there are generations --
250.276	at least one or two --
253.455	who have experienced the equality
256.179	that Title IX and other fights
256.179	along the way made possible.
261.089	And for women, there are generations
261.089	who have also experienced teamwork.
265.704	They got to play team sports
265.704	in a way they hadn't before.
270.146	So you had a legacy already built
270.146	in terms of being an athlete,
275.251	a legacy of the work you did
275.251	to lobby for equal pay for women athletes
280.53	and the Women's Sports Foundation.
283.368	What now are you looking to accomplish
286.094	with The Billie Jean King
286.094	Leadership Initiative?
289.36	BJK: I think it goes back
289.36	to an epiphany I had at 12.
292.232	At 11, I wanted to be the number one
292.232	tennis player in the world,
295.257	and a friend had asked me to play
295.257	"and I said, ""What's that?"""
299.098	Tennis was not in my family --
299.098	basketball was, other sports.
302.597	Fast forward to 12 years old,
304.489	(Laughter)
306.11	and I'm finally starting
306.11	to play in tournaments
308.348	where you get a ranking
308.348	at the end of the year.
311.432	So I was daydreaming
311.432	at the Los Angeles Tennis Club,
314.825	and I started thinking about my sport
314.825	and how tiny it was,
319.613	but also that everybody who played
319.613	wore white shoes, white clothes,
323.286	played with white balls --
323.286	everybody who played was white.
326.88	And I said to myself, at 12 years old,
326.88	"""Where is everyone else?"""
334.222	And that just kept sticking in my brain.
337.397	And that moment,
338.572	I promised myself I'd fight
338.572	for equal rights and opportunities
341.55	for boys and girls, men and women,
341.55	the rest of my life.
344.779	And that tennis, if I was fortunate
344.779	enough to become number one --
349.015	and I knew, being a girl,
349.015	it would be harder to have influence,
352.53	already at that age --
354.531	that I had this platform.
358.301	And tennis is global.
361.451	"And I thought, ""You know what?"
364.163	I've been given an opportunity
364.163	"that very few people have had."""
367.115	I didn't know if I was going
367.115	to make it -- this was only 12.
370.094	I sure wanted it, but making it
370.094	is a whole other discussion.
373.246	I just remember I promised myself,
373.246	and I really try to keep my word.
378.174	That's who I truly am,
378.174	just fighting for people.
382	And, unfortunately, women have had less.
387.031	And we are considered less.
389.324	And so my attentions,
389.324	where did they have to go?
391.616	It was just ... you have to.
393.825	And learn to stick up for yourself,
393.825	hear your own voice.
397.08	You hear the same words
397.08	keep coming out all the time,
400.441	and I got really lucky
400.441	because I had an education.
404.182	And I think if you can see it
404.182	you can be it, you know?
406.774	If you can see it, you can be it.
409.014	You look at Pat,
409.014	you look at other leaders,
411.042	you look at these speakers,
411.042	look at yourself,
413.212	because everyone --
414.894	everyone --
416.276	can do something extraordinary.
418.113	Every single person.
419.579	PM: And your story, Billie,
419.579	has inspired so many women everywhere.
424.287	Now with the Billie Jean King
424.287	Leadership Initiative,
427.182	you're taking on an even bigger cause.
429.39	Because one thing we hear a lot
429.39	about is women taking their voice,
433.438	working to find their way
433.438	into leadership positions.
436.889	But what you're talking
436.889	about is even bigger than that.
439.745	It's inclusive leadership.
441.998	And this is a generation that has grown up
441.998	thinking more inclusively --
445.612	BJK: Isn't it great?
445.612	Look at the technology!
447.757	It's amazing how it connects us all!
447.757	It's about connection.
452.333	It's simply amazing
452.333	what's possible because of it.
455.971	But the Billie Jean King
455.971	Leadership Initiative
458.435	is really about the workforce mostly,
458.435	and trying to change it,
461.523	so people can actually go to work
461.523	and be their authentic selves.
465.892	Because most of us have two jobs:
468.953	One, to fit in -- I'll give you
468.953	a perfect example.
471.596	An African American woman
471.596	gets up an hour earlier to go to work,
474.951	straightens her hair in the bathroom,
476.776	goes to the bathroom
476.776	probably four, five, six times a day
479.983	to keep straightening her hair,
479.983	to keep making sure she fits in.
483.095	So she's working two jobs.
484.389	She's got this other job,
484.389	whatever that may be,
486.798	but she's also trying to fit in.
489.032	Or this poor man who kept his diploma --
493.099	he went to University of Michigan,
494.839	but he never would talk about
494.839	his poverty as a youngster, ever --
498.184	just would not mention it.
499.527	So he made sure they saw
499.527	he was well-educated.
502.338	And then you see a gay guy
502.338	who has an NFL --
504.806	which means American football
504.806	for all of you out there,
507.471	it's a big deal, it's very macho --
509.447	and he talked about football all the time,
511.493	because he was gay
511.493	and he didn't want anybody to know.
515.097	It just goes on and on.
516.898	So my wish for everyone is to be able
516.898	to be their authentic self 24/7,
523.035	that would be the ultimate.
524.865	And we catch ourselves -- I mean,
524.865	I catch myself to this day.
528.415	Even being gay I catch myself,
528.415	you know, like,
530.586	(Gasp)
532.464	a little uncomfortable,
532.464	a little surge in my gut,
535.576	feeling not totally
535.576	comfortable in my own skin.
540.655	So, I think you have to ask yourself --
542.908	I want people to be themselves,
542.908	whatever that is, just let it be.
546.079	PM: And the first research
546.079	the Leadership Initiative did showed that,
549.815	that these examples you just used --
553.075	that many of us have the problem
553.075	of being authentic.
557.904	But what you've just looked at
557.904	is this millennial generation,
561.953	who have benefited from all these
561.953	equal opportunities --
565.515	which may not be equal
565.515	but exist everywhere --
567.7	BJK: First of all, I'm really lucky.
569.443	Partnership with Teneo,
569.443	a strategic company that's amazing.
573.999	That's really the reason
573.999	I'm able to do this.
576.517	I've had two times in my life
578.002	where I've actually had men
578.002	really behind me with power.
580.712	And that was in the old days
580.712	with Philip Morris with Virginia Slims,
584.026	and this is the second time
584.026	in my entire life.
586.384	And then Deloitte.
589.157	The one thing I wanted was data -- facts.
592.465	So Deloitte sent out a survey,
594.216	and over 4,000 people now have answered,
598.245	and we're continuing in the workplace.
600.871	And what do the millennials feel?
604.157	Well, they feel a lot, but what
604.157	they're so fantastic about is --
607.442	you know, our generation was like,
607.442	"""Oh, we're going to get representation."""
610.995	So if you walk into a room,
610.995	you see everybody represented.
613.807	That's not good enough anymore,
613.807	which is so good!
616.301	So the millennials are fantastic;
616.301	they want connection, engagement.
620.545	They just want you to tell us
620.545	what you're feeling, what you're thinking,
623.993	and get into the solution.
625.27	They're problem-solvers,
626.532	and of course, you've got
626.532	the information at your fingertips,
629.431	compared to when I was growing up.
632.157	PM: What did the research show you
632.157	about millennials?
634.709	Are they going to make a difference?
636.452	Are they going to create a world where
636.452	there is really an inclusive work force?
640.493	BJK: Well, in 2025,
646.409	is going to be millennials.
648.202	I think they are going
648.202	to help solve problems.
650.513	I think they have
650.513	the wherewithal to do it.
652.633	I know they care a lot.
654.228	They have big ideas
654.228	and they can make big things happen.
659.049	I want to stay in the now
659.049	with the young people,
661.391	I don't want to get behind.
664.673	(Laughter)
666.368	PM: I don't think there's any chance!
669.604	But what you found out
669.604	in the research about millennials
672.623	is not really the experience that a lot
672.623	of people have with millennials.
677.274	BJK: No, well, if we want to talk --
677.274	OK, I've been doing my little mini-survey.
681.062	I've been talking to the Boomers,
681.062	who are their bosses, and I go,
685.969	"""What do you think about the millennials?"""
688.039	And I'm pretty excited, like it's good,
689.939	and they get this face --
691.419	(Laughter)
693.759	"""Oh, you mean the 'Me' generation?"""
695.465	(Laughter)
697.07	"I say, ""Do you really think so?"
698.582	Because I do think they care
698.582	about the environment
701.488	"and all these things."""
703.442	"And they go, ""Oh, Billie,"
703.442	"they cannot focus."""
707.951	(Laughter)
710.677	They actually have proven
712.32	that the average focus
712.32	for an 18-year-old is 37 seconds.
715.838	(Laughter)
717.431	They can't focus.
718.854	And they don't really care.
720.287	I just heard a story the other night:
722.152	a woman owns a gallery
722.152	and she has these workers.
725.547	She gets a text from one of the workers,
728.736	like an intern, she's
728.736	just starting -- she goes,
731.408	"""Oh, by the way, I'm going to be late"
731.408	"because I'm at the hairdresser's."""
734.815	(Laughter)
739.751	So she arrives, and this boss says,
743.587	"""What's going on?"""
744.762	"And she says, ""Oh, I was late,"
744.762	"sorry, how's it going?"""
747.312	"She says, ""Well, guess what?"
747.312	"I'd like you leave, you're finished."""
751.436	"She goes, ""OK."""
752.826	(Laughter)
756.052	No problem!
757.227	PM: Now Billie, that story --
758.673	I know, but that's what
758.673	scares the boomers --
761.131	I'm just telling you --
761.131	so I think it's good for us to share.
764.018	(Laughter)
765.611	No, it is good for us to share,
767.118	because we're our authentic selves
767.118	and what we're really feeling,
770.211	so we've got to take it
770.211	both ways, you know?
772.508	But I have great faith because --
774.479	if you've been in sports like I have --
777.396	every generation gets better.
779.053	It's a fact.
780.362	With the Women's Sports Foundation
780.362	being the advocates for Title IX still,
784.395	because we're trying
784.395	to keep protecting the law,
786.672	because it's in a tenuous position always,
789.841	so we really are concerned,
791.745	and we do a lot of research.
793.46	That's very important to us.
795.158	And I want to hear from people.
797.407	But we really have to protect
797.407	what Title IX stands for worldwide.
802.88	And you heard President Carter
802.88	talk about how Title IX is protected.
808.598	And do you know that every single lawsuit
812.216	that girls, at least in sports,
812.216	have gone up against --
815.758	whatever institutions --
818.191	has won?
819.616	Title IX is there to protect us.
822.199	And it is amazing.
823.812	But we still have to get
823.812	the hearts and minds --
827.812	the hearts and minds
827.812	to match the legislation is huge.
830.573	PM: So what gets you up every morning?
832.68	What keeps you sustaining your work,
835.136	sustaining the fight
835.136	for equality, extending it,
838.358	always exploring new areas,
838.358	trying to find new ways ... ?
841.813	BJK: Well, I always drove my parents crazy
841.813	because I was always the curious one.
846.678	I'm highly motivated.
848.446	My younger brother was
848.446	a Major League Baseball player.
852.745	My poor parents did not care
852.745	if we were any good.
855.32	(Laughter)
856.586	And we drove them crazy because we pushed,
859.349	we pushed because
859.349	we wanted to be the best.
864.587	And I think it's because of what
864.587	I'm hearing today in TED talks.
869.858	I think to listen to these
869.858	different women,
873.538	to listen to different people,
875.042	to listen to President Carter --
878.312	and he we was throwing these figures
878.312	out that I would never --
881.808	I'd have to go,
