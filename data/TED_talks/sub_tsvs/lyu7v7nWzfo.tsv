12.74	Just over a year ago,
14.66	for the third time in my life,
14.66	I ceased to exist.
17.06	I was having a small operation,
17.06	and my brain was filling with anesthetic.
22.34	I remember a sense
22.34	of detachment and falling apart
25.7	and a coldness.
27.7	And then I was back,
27.7	drowsy and disoriented,
30.14	but definitely there.
32.1	Now, when you wake from a deep sleep,
33.94	you might feel confused about the time
33.94	or anxious about oversleeping,
37.22	but there's always a basic sense
37.22	of time having passed,
39.98	of a continuity between then and now.
42.22	Coming round from
42.22	anesthesia is very different.
44.46	I could have been under
44.46	for five minutes, five hours,
46.98	five years or even 50 years.
48.42	I simply wasn't there.
49.9	It was total oblivion.
52.06	Anesthesia --
52.06	it's a modern kind of magic.
54.14	It turns people into objects,
57.34	and then, we hope, back again into people.
59.364	And in this process
60.62	is one of the greatest remaining
60.62	mysteries in science and philosophy.
64.22	How does consciousness happen?
65.86	Somehow, within each of our brains,
68.1	the combined activity
68.1	of many billions of neurons,
71.02	each one a tiny biological machine,
74.06	is generating a conscious experience.
75.9	And not just any conscious experience --
77.86	your conscious experience
77.86	right here and right now.
80.265	How does this happen?
82.38	Answering this question is so important
84.46	because consciousness
84.46	for each of us is all there is.
87.34	Without it there's no world,
90.22	there's no self,
91.62	there's nothing at all.
93.18	And when we suffer, we suffer consciously
95.157	whether it's through
95.157	mental illness or pain.
98.22	And if we can experience
98.22	joy and suffering,
101.18	what about other animals?
103.14	Might they be conscious, too?
104.58	Do they also have a sense of self?
106.26	And as computers get faster and smarter,
109.42	maybe there will come a point,
109.42	maybe not too far away,
112.02	when my iPhone develops
112.02	a sense of its own existence.
114.78	I actually think the prospects
114.78	for a conscious AI are pretty remote.
119.78	And I think this because
119.78	my research is telling me
122.18	that consciousness has less to do
122.18	with pure intelligence
124.86	and more to do with our nature
124.86	as living and breathing organisms.
129.46	Consciousness and intelligence
129.46	are very different things.
132.18	You don't have to be smart to suffer,
132.18	but you probably do have to be alive.
137.02	In the story I'm going to tell you,
138.74	our conscious experiences
138.74	of the world around us,
141.1	and of ourselves within it,
142.459	are kinds of controlled hallucinations
145.02	that happen with, through
145.02	and because of our living bodies.
149.66	Now, you might have heard
149.66	that we know nothing
153.02	about how the brain and body
153.02	give rise to consciousness.
155.78	Some people even say it's beyond
155.78	the reach of science altogether.
158.94	But in fact,
160.18	the last 25 years have seen an explosion
160.18	of scientific work in this area.
164.34	If you come to my lab
164.34	at the University of Sussex,
167.14	you'll find scientists
167.14	from all different disciplines
171.02	and sometimes even philosophers.
173.62	All of us together trying to understand
173.62	how consciousness happens
177.62	and what happens when it goes wrong.
179.7	And the strategy is very simple.
181.86	I'd like you to think about consciousness
183.86	in the way that we've
183.86	come to think about life.
186.1	At one time, people thought
186.1	the property of being alive
188.74	could not be explained
188.74	by physics and chemistry --
191.38	that life had to be
191.38	more than just mechanism.
194.3	But people no longer think that.
196.22	As biologists got on with the job
197.86	of explaining the properties
197.86	of living systems
200.46	in terms of physics and chemistry --
202.3	things like metabolism,
202.3	reproduction, homeostasis --
205.38	the basic mystery of what life is
205.38	started to fade away,
209.22	and people didn't propose
209.22	any more magical solutions,
212.3	like a force of life or an Ã©lan vital.
214.9	So as with life, so with consciousness.
217.58	Once we start explaining its properties
219.9	in terms of things happening
219.9	inside brains and bodies,
223.62	the apparently insoluble mystery
223.62	of what consciousness is
227.06	should start to fade away.
228.82	At least that's the plan.
231.1	So let's get started.
232.38	What are the properties of consciousness?
234.38	What should a science
234.38	of consciousness try to explain?
237.78	Well, for today I'd just like to think
237.78	of consciousness in two different ways.
241.5	There are experiences
241.5	of the world around us,
243.9	full of sights, sounds and smells,
246.14	there's multisensory, panoramic,
246.14	3D, fully immersive inner movie.
250.82	And then there's conscious self.
252.9	The specific experience
252.9	of being you or being me.
255.38	The lead character in this inner movie,
257.42	and probably the aspect of consciousness
257.42	we all cling to most tightly.
261.66	Let's start with experiences
261.66	of the world around us,
264.14	and with the important idea
264.14	of the brain as a prediction engine.
267.899	Imagine being a brain.
270.42	You're locked inside a bony skull,
272.099	trying to figure
272.099	what's out there in the world.
274.34	There's no lights inside the skull.
274.34	There's no sound either.
277.38	All you've got to go on
277.38	is streams of electrical impulses
280.18	which are only indirectly related
280.18	to things in the world,
283.38	whatever they may be.
285.34	So perception --
285.34	figuring out what's there --
287.5	has to be a process of informed guesswork
290.38	in which the brain combines
290.38	these sensory signals
293.54	with its prior expectations or beliefs
293.54	about the way the world is
297.62	to form its best guess
297.62	of what caused those signals.
300.78	The brain doesn't hear sound or see light.
303.5	What we perceive is its best guess
303.5	of what's out there in the world.
308.86	Let me give you a couple
308.86	of examples of all this.
312.22	You might have seen this illusion before,
314.22	but I'd like you to think
314.22	about it in a new way.
316.5	If you look at those two patches, A and B,
318.58	they should look to you to be
318.58	very different shades of gray, right?
322.86	But they are in fact
322.86	exactly the same shade.
325.86	And I can illustrate this.
327.22	If I put up a second version
327.22	of the image here
329.46	and join the two patches
329.46	with a gray-colored bar,
332.5	you can see there's no difference.
334.18	It's exactly the same shade of gray.
335.98	And if you still don't believe me,
337.66	I'll bring the bar across
337.66	and join them up.
340.5	It's a single colored block of gray,
340.5	there's no difference at all.
344.58	This isn't any kind of magic trick.
346.3	It's the same shade of gray,
347.74	but take it away again,
347.74	and it looks different.
351.06	So what's happening here
352.34	is that the brain
352.34	is using its prior expectations
355.18	built deeply into the circuits
355.18	of the visual cortex
358.3	that a cast shadow dims
358.3	the appearance of a surface,
361.02	so that we see B as lighter
361.02	than it really is.
365.74	Here's one more example,
367.02	which shows just how quickly
367.02	the brain can use new predictions
370.22	to change what we consciously experience.
372.54	Have a listen to this.
375.26	(Distorted voice)
379.14	Sounded strange, right?
380.74	Have a listen again
380.74	and see if you can get anything.
383.58	(Distorted voice)
387.7	Still strange.
388.98	Now listen to this.
390.74	(Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit
390.74	is a really terrible idea.
393.82	(Laughter)
395.18	Which I do.
396.42	So you heard some words there, right?
398.26	Now listen to the first sound again.
398.26	I'm just going to replay it.
401.38	(Distorted voice)
404.46	Yeah? So you can now hear words there.
406.98	Once more for luck.
408.86	(Distorted voice)
412.82	OK, so what's going on here?
415.1	The remarkable thing is the sensory
415.1	information coming into the brain
418.7	hasn't changed at all.
420.5	All that's changed
420.5	is your brain's best guess
423.06	of the causes of that sensory information.
425.14	And that changes
425.14	what you consciously hear.
428.38	All this puts the brain
428.38	basis of perception
431.54	in a bit of a different light.
433.02	Instead of perception depending largely
433.02	on signals coming into the brain
437.06	from the outside world,
438.62	it depends as much, if not more,
441.14	on perceptual predictions
441.14	flowing in the opposite direction.
445.98	We don't just passively
445.98	perceive the world,
448.06	we actively generate it.
449.78	The world we experience
449.78	comes as much, if not more,
452.42	from the inside out
453.78	as from the outside in.
455.46	Let me give you
455.46	one more example of perception
457.66	as this active, constructive process.
461.22	Here we've combined immersive
461.22	virtual reality with image processing
466.38	to simulate the effects
466.38	of overly strong perceptual predictions
469.38	on experience.
470.74	In this panoramic video,
470.74	we've transformed the world --
473.66	which is in this case Sussex campus --
475.58	into a psychedelic playground.
477.58	We've processed the footage using
477.58	an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream
481.46	to simulate the effects
481.46	of overly strong perceptual predictions.
485.58	In this case, to see dogs.
487.22	And you can see
487.22	this is a very strange thing.
489.38	When perceptual
489.38	predictions are too strong,
491.5	as they are here,
492.9	the result looks very much
492.9	like the kinds of hallucinations
495.82	people might report in altered states,
497.86	or perhaps even in psychosis.
500.94	Now, think about this for a minute.
502.98	If hallucination is a kind
502.98	of uncontrolled perception,
508.1	then perception right here and right now
508.1	is also a kind of hallucination,
512.58	but a controlled hallucination
514.62	in which the brain's predictions
514.62	are being reigned in
517.54	by sensory information from the world.
520.02	In fact, we're all
520.02	hallucinating all the time,
523.02	including right now.
524.42	It's just that when we agree
524.42	about our hallucinations,
527.26	we call that reality.
529.1	(Laughter)
533.06	Now I'm going to tell you
533.06	that your experience of being a self,
536.42	the specific experience of being you,
538.26	is also a controlled hallucination
538.26	generated by the brain.
541.78	This seems a very strange idea, right?
543.82	Yes, visual illusions
543.82	might deceive my eyes,
545.98	but how could I be deceived
545.98	about what it means to be me?
550.02	For most of us,
551.26	the experience of being a person
552.86	is so familiar, so unified
552.86	and so continuous
554.98	that it's difficult
554.98	not to take it for granted.
557.22	But we shouldn't take it for granted.
559.06	There are in fact many different ways
559.06	we experience being a self.
562.3	There's the experience of having a body
564.42	and of being a body.
565.9	There are experiences
565.9	of perceiving the world
568.06	from a first person point of view.
570.06	There are experiences
570.06	of intending to do things
572.3	and of being the cause of things
572.3	that happen in the world.
575.46	And there are experiences
576.74	of being a continuous
576.74	and distinctive person over time,
580.66	built from a rich set
580.66	of memories and social interactions.
584.02	Many experiments show,
585.34	and psychiatrists
585.34	and neurologists know very well,
587.7	that these different ways
587.7	in which we experience being a self
590.62	can all come apart.
592.34	What this means is
592.34	the basic background experience
595.26	of being a unified self is a rather
595.26	fragile construction of the brain.
599.86	Another experience,
599.86	which just like all others,
602.54	requires explanation.
604.54	So let's return to the bodily self.
606.34	How does the brain generate
606.34	the experience of being a body
609.1	and of having a body?
610.38	Well, just the same principles apply.
612.26	The brain makes its best guess
613.74	about what is and what is not
613.74	part of its body.
616.7	And there's a beautiful experiment
616.7	in neuroscience to illustrate this.
620.46	And unlike most neuroscience experiments,
622.46	this is one you can do at home.
623.98	All you need is one of these.
625.9	(Laughter)
627.18	And a couple of paintbrushes.
630.7	In the rubber hand illusion,
632.1	a person's real hand is hidden from view,
634.1	and that fake rubber hand
634.1	is placed in front of them.
636.74	Then both hands are simultaneously
636.74	stroked with a paintbrush
640.02	while the person stares at the fake hand.
643.14	Now, for most people, after a while,
645.14	this leads to the very uncanny sensation
647.26	that the fake hand
647.26	is in fact part of their body.
651.46	And the idea is that the congruence
651.46	between seeing touch and feeling touch
655.66	on an object that looks like hand
655.66	and is roughly where a hand should be,
660.06	is enough evidence for the brain
660.06	to make its best guess
662.86	that the fake hand
662.86	is in fact part of the body.
666.1	(Laughter)
675.06	So you can measure
675.06	all kinds of clever things.
677.34	You can measure skin conductance
677.34	and startle responses,
680.66	but there's no need.
681.94	It's clear the guy in blue
681.94	has assimilated the fake hand.
684.9	This means that even experiences
684.9	of what our body is
688.34	is a kind of best guessing --
689.9	a kind of controlled
689.9	hallucination by the brain.
693.3	There's one more thing.
695.94	We don't just experience our bodies
695.94	as objects in the world from the outside,
699.62	we also experience them from within.
701.38	We all experience the sense
701.38	of being a body from the inside.
706.82	And sensory signals
706.82	coming from the inside of the body
709.42	are continually telling the brain
709.42	about the state of the internal organs,
713.5	how the heart is doing,
713.5	what the blood pressure is like,
716.18	lots of things.
717.42	This kind of perception,
717.42	which we call interoception,
720.66	is rather overlooked.
721.94	But it's critically important
723.38	because perception and regulation
723.38	of the internal state of the body --
726.74	well, that's what keeps us alive.
729.22	Here's another version
729.22	of the rubber hand illusion.
731.66	This is from our lab at Sussex.
733.18	And here, people see
733.18	a virtual reality version of their hand,
736.62	which flashes red and back
738.02	either in time or out of time
738.02	with their heartbeat.
741.3	And when it's flashing
741.3	in time with their heartbeat,
743.78	people have a stronger sense
743.78	that it's in fact part of their body.
747.54	So experiences of having a body
747.54	are deeply grounded
751.06	in perceiving our bodies from within.
755.5	There's one last thing
755.5	I want to draw your attention to,
758.18	which is that experiences of the body
758.18	from the inside are very different
761.86	from experiences of the world around us.
763.94	When I look around me,
763.94	the world seems full of objects --
766.66	tables, chairs, rubber hands,
768.86	people, you lot --
770.62	even my own body in the world,
772.62	I can perceive it
772.62	as an object from the outside.
774.9	But my experiences
774.9	of the body from within,
776.98	they're not like that at all.
778.42	I don't perceive my kidneys here,
780.5	my liver here,
782.1	my spleen ...
783.38	I don't know where my spleen is,
785.3	but it's somewhere.
786.7	I don't perceive my insides as objects.
788.62	In fact, I don't experience them
788.62	much at all unless they go wrong.
793.22	And this is important, I think.
795.42	Perception of the internal
795.42	state of the body
797.54	isn't about figuring out what's there,
799.42	it's about control and regulation --
801.58	keeping the physiological variables
801.58	within the tight bounds
805.5	that are compatible with survival.
808.46	When the brain uses predictions
808.46	to figure out what's there,
811.34	we perceive objects
811.34	as the causes of sensations.
814.46	When the brain uses predictions
814.46	to control and regulate things,
818.1	we experience how well
818.1	or how badly that control is going.
821.7	So our most basic experiences
821.7	of being a self,
824.54	of being an embodied organism,
826.62	are deeply grounded in the biological
826.62	mechanisms that keep us alive.
832.58	And when we follow this idea
832.58	all the way through,
834.94	we can start to see
834.94	that all of our conscious experiences,
838.66	since they all depend on the same
838.66	mechanisms of predictive perception,
843.42	all stem from this basic
843.42	drive to stay alive.
846.86	We experience the world and ourselves
849.5	with, through and because of
849.5	our living bodies.
853.38	Let me bring things together step-by-step.
856.38	What we consciously see depends
857.98	on the brain's best guess
857.98	of what's out there.
860.3	Our experienced world
860.3	comes from the inside out,
862.7	not just the outside in.
864.42	The rubber hand illusion shows
864.42	that this applies to our experiences
867.7	of what is and what is not our body.
870.38	And these self-related predictions
870.38	depend critically on sensory signals
873.98	coming from deep inside the body.
876.22	And finally,
877.46	experiences of being an embodied self
877.46	are more about control and regulation
881.86	than figuring out what's there.
884.66	So our experiences of the world
884.66	around us and ourselves within it --
887.9	well, they're kinds
887.9	of controlled hallucinations
890.18	that have been shaped
890.18	over millions of years of evolution
893.1	to keep us alive in worlds
893.1	full of danger and opportunity.
896.3	We predict ourselves into existence.
900.34	Now, I leave you with three
900.34	implications of all this.
903.46	First, just as we can
903.46	misperceive the world,
905.7	we can misperceive ourselves
907.5	when the mechanisms
907.5	of prediction go wrong.
909.66	Understanding this opens many new
909.66	opportunities in psychiatry and neurology,
913.9	because we can finally
913.9	get at the mechanisms
916.54	rather than just treating the symptoms
918.46	in conditions like
918.46	depression and schizophrenia.
921.54	Second:
922.78	what it means to be me
922.78	cannot be reduced to or uploaded to
926.62	a software program running on a robot,
929.02	however smart or sophisticated.
931.26	We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals
933.9	whose conscious experiences
933.9	are shaped at all levels
937.18	by the biological mechanisms
937.18	that keep us alive.
940.18	Just making computers smarter
940.18	is not going to make them sentient.
944.82	Finally,
946.14	our own individual inner universe,
948.14	our way of being conscious,
949.82	is just one possible
949.82	way of being conscious.
953.66	And even human consciousness generally --
955.66	it's just a tiny region in a vast space
955.66	of possible consciousnesses.
959.66	Our individual self and worlds
959.66	are unique to each of us,
963.34	but they're all grounded
963.34	in biological mechanisms
966.58	shared with many other living creatures.
969.74	Now, these are fundamental changes
973.58	in how we understand ourselves,
975.86	but I think they should be celebrated,
977.74	because as so often in science,
977.74	from Copernicus --
980.14	we're not at the center of the universe --
982.164	to Darwin --
983.42	we're related to all other creatures --
985.66	to the present day.
988.14	With a greater sense of understanding
990.9	comes a greater sense of wonder,
993.34	and a greater realization
995.22	that we are part of
995.22	and not apart from the rest of nature.
1000.74	And ...
1002.54	when the end of consciousness comes,
1004.94	there's nothing to be afraid of.
1008.38	Nothing at all.
1010.3	Thank you.
1011.54	(Applause)
