12.044	Is E.T. out there?
13.037	Well, I work at the SETI Institute.
16.016	That's almost my name. SETI:
17.251	Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
19.658	In other words, I look for aliens,
21.277	and when I tell people that at a cocktail party, they usually
24.945	look at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face.
27.706	I try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate.
30.039	Now, a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic,
32.799	ridiculous, maybe even hopeless,
35.049	but I just want to talk to you a little bit about why I think
38.754	that the job I have is actually a privilege, okay,
42.568	and give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into
44.666	this line of work, if that's what you call it.
47.021	This thing — whoops, can we go back?
50.029	Hello, come in, Earth.
52.728	There we go. All right.
54.079	This is the Owens Valley Radio Observatory
56.072	behind the Sierra Nevadas, and in 1968,
59.508	I was working there collecting data for my thesis.
62.417	Now, it's kinda lonely, it's kinda tedious, just collecting data,
65.758	so I would amuse myself by taking photos at night
68.291	of the telescopes or even of myself,
71.052	because, you know, at night, I would be the only hominid
76.286	within about 30 miles.
78.034	So here are pictures of myself.
80.043	The observatory had just acquired a new book,
83.631	written by a Russian cosmologist
85.381	by the name of Joseph Shklovsky, and then expanded
88.999	and translated and edited by a little-known
91.452	Cornell astronomer by the name of Carl Sagan.
94.061	And I remember reading that book,
96.058	and at 3 in the morning I was reading this book
98.066	and it was explaining how the antennas I was using
100.759	to measure the spins of galaxies could also be used
105.706	to communicate, to send bits of information
108.018	from one star system to another.
110.61	Now, at 3 o'clock in the morning when you're all alone,
112.078	haven't had much sleep, that was a very romantic idea,
115.009	but it was that idea -- the fact that you could in fact
118.898	prove that there's somebody out there
120.382	just using this same technology --
123.098	that appealed to me so much that 20 years later I took a job
125.328	at the SETI Institute. Now, I have to say
127.301	that my memory is notoriously porous, and I've often
131.751	wondered whether there was any truth in this story,
133.584	or I was just, you know, misremembering something,
135.088	but I recently just blew up this old negative of mine,
137.836	and sure enough, there you can see
139.435	the Shklovsky and Sagan book underneath that
141.546	analog calculating device.
144.023	So it was true.
144.926	All right. Now, the idea for doing this, it wasn't very old
147.367	at the time that I made that photo.
149.031	The idea dates from 1960, when a young astronomer
152.509	by the name of Frank Drake used this antenna
155.005	in West Virginia, pointed it at a couple of nearby stars
158.615	in the hopes of eavesdropping on E.T.
162.004	Now, Frank didn't hear anything.
163.6	Actually he did, but it turned out to be the U.S. Air Force,
166.009	which doesn't count as extraterrestrial intelligence.
168.974	But Drake's idea here became very popular
171.74	because it was very appealing — and I'll get back to that —
174.197	and on the basis of this experiment, which didn't succeed,
177.613	we have been doing SETI ever since,
179.468	not continuously, but ever since.
181.502	We still haven't heard anything.
183.388	We still haven't heard anything.
185.066	In fact, we don't know about any life beyond Earth,
186.859	but I'm going to suggest to you that that's going to change
189.659	rather soon, and part of the reason, in fact,
192.028	the majority of the reason why I think that's going to change
194.803	is that the equipment's getting better.
196.068	This is the Allen Telescope Array, about 350 miles
199.005	from whatever seat you're in right now.
201.021	This is something that we're using today
203.026	to search for E.T., and the electronics have gotten
205.03	very much better too.
206.5	This is Frank Drake's electronics in 1960.
209.026	This is the Allen Telescope Array electronics today.
211.047	Some pundit with too much time on his hands
214.536	has reckoned that the new experiments are approximately
223.534	That's a degree of an improvement that would look good
225.623	on your report card, okay?
228.03	But something that's not appreciated by the public is,
230.664	in fact, that the experiment continues to get better,
233.389	and, consequently, tends to get faster.
236.037	This is a little plot, and every time you show a plot,
237.726	you lose 10 percent of the audience.
239.364	I have 12 of these. (Laughter)
241.673	But what I plotted here is just some metric
246.093	that shows how fast we're searching.
248.647	In other words, we're looking for a needle in a haystack.
250.755	We know how big the haystack is. It's the galaxy.
253.042	But we're going through the haystack no longer
255.753	with a teaspoon but with a skip loader,
258.045	because of this increase in speed.
260.016	In fact, those of you who are still conscious
261.451	and mathematically competent,
264.011	will note that this is a semi-log plot.
266.089	In other words, the rate of increase is exponential.
270.481	It's exponentially improving. Now, exponential is an
273.214	overworked word. You hear it on the media all the time.
275.533	They don't really know what exponential means,
277.07	but this is exponential.
279.081	In fact, it's doubling every 18 months, and, of course,
282.001	every card-carrying member of the digerati knows
284.005	that that's Moore's Law.
285.497	So this means that over the course of the next
288.098	two dozen years, we'll be able to look at a million star systems,
292.01	a million star systems, looking for signals
294.038	that would prove somebody's out there.
295.547	Well, a million star systems, is that interesting?
298.045	I mean, how many of those star systems have planets?
301.059	And the facts are, we didn't know the answer to that
303.204	even as recently as 15 years ago, and in fact, we really
305.978	didn't know it even as recently as six months ago.
308.501	But now we do. Recent results suggest
311.379	that virtually every star has planets, and more than one.
315.018	They're like, you know, kittens. You get a litter.
318.344	You don't get one kitten. You get a bunch.
320.084	So in fact, this is a pretty accurate estimate
323.018	of the number of planets in our galaxy,
327.014	just in our galaxy, by the way,
329.041	and I remind the non-astronomy majors among you
331.811	that our galaxy is only one of 100 billion
334.056	that we can see with our telescopes.
336.04	That's a lot of real estate, but of course,
337.563	most of these planets are going to be kind of worthless,
339.472	like, you know, Mercury, or Neptune.
341.564	Neptune's probably not very big in your life.
343.654	So the question is, what fraction of these planets
348.001	are actually suitable for life?
349.683	We don't know the answer to that either,
351.088	but we will learn that answer this year, thanks to
353.326	NASA's Kepler Space Telescope,
355.082	and in fact, the smart money, which is to say the people who work on this project,
359.104	the smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets
362.533	that might be suitable for life is maybe one in a thousand,
366.569	one in a hundred, something like that.
369.876	Well, even taking the pessimistic estimate, that it's
372.016	one in a thousand, that means that there are
375.127	at least a billion cousins of the Earth
377.656	just in our own galaxy.
379.383	Okay, now I've given you a lot of numbers here,
381.636	but they're mostly big numbers, okay, so, you know,
385.562	keep that in mind. There's plenty of real estate,
388.041	plenty of real estate in the universe,
390.054	and if we're the only bit of real estate in which there's
393.003	some interesting occupants, that makes you a miracle,
396.038	and I know you like to think you're a miracle,
398.719	but if you do science, you learn rather quickly that
400.629	every time you think you're a miracle, you're wrong,
402.512	so probably not the case.
405.04	All right, so the bottom line is this:
407.091	Because of the increase in speed, and because of the
410.054	vast amount of habitable real estate in the cosmos, I figure
415.005	we're going to pick up a signal within two dozen years.
417.05	And I feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you:
420.021	Either we're going to find E.T. in the next two dozen years,
422.458	or I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
426.076	So that's not so bad. I mean, even with two dozen years,
428.71	you open up your browser and there's news of a signal,
430.569	or you get a cup of coffee.
432.32	Now, let me tell you about some aspect of this that
436.293	people don't think about, and that is,
438.331	what happens? Suppose that what I say is true.
442.039	I mean, who knows, but suppose it happens.
444.404	Suppose some time in the next two dozen years
445.891	we pick up a faint line that tells us
448.068	we have some cosmic company.
449.756	What is the effect? What's the consequence?
452.051	Now, I might be at ground zero for this.
454.015	I happen to know what the consequence for me would be,
455.836	because we've had false alarms. This is 1997,
458.76	and this is a photo I made at about 3 o'clock in the morning
461.044	in Mountain View here, when we were watching
463.053	the computer monitors because we had picked up a signal
465.368	"that we thought, ""This is the real deal."" All right?"
468.446	And I kept waiting for the Men in Black to show up. Right?
471.814	I kept waiting for -- I kept waiting for my mom to call,
476.017	somebody to call, the government to call. Nobody called.
479.021	Nobody called. I was so nervous
482.191	that I couldn't sit down. I just wandered around
484.015	taking photos like this one, just for something to do.
487.005	Well, at 9:30 in the morning, with my head down
489.039	on my desk because I obviously hadn't slept all night,
491.069	the phone rings and it's The New York Times.
493.406	And I think there's a lesson in that, and that lesson is
496.032	that if we pick up a signal, the media, the media will be on it
499.012	faster than a weasel on ball bearings. It's going to be fast.
503.346	You can be sure of that. No secrecy.
505.024	That's what happens to me. It kind of ruins my whole week,
508.007	because whatever I've got planned that week is kind of out the window.
510.63	But what about you? What's it going to do to you?
513.05	And the answer is that we don't know the answer.
515.057	We don't know what that's going to do to you,
515.942	not in the long term, and not even very much in the short term.
519.066	I mean, that would be a bit like
521.894	"asking Chris Columbus in 1491, ""Hey Chris,"
525	you know, what happens if it turns out that there's a
527.014	continent between here and Japan, where you're sailing to,
530.55	what will be the consequences for humanity
533.325	"if that turns out to be the case?"""
535.071	And I think Chris would probably offer you some answer
537.301	that you might not have understood, but it probably
540.012	wouldn't have been right, and I think that to predict
542.846	what finding E.T.'s going to mean,
544.605	we can't predict that either.
545.685	But here are a couple things I can say.
547.307	To begin with, it's going to be a society that's way in advance of our own.
551.464	You're not going to hear from alien Neanderthals.
553.088	They're not building transmitters.
554.378	They're going to be ahead of us, maybe by a few thousand
556.304	years, maybe by a few millions years, but substantially
559.371	ahead of us, and that means, if you can understand
561.6	anything that they're going to say, then you might be able
565.386	to short-circuit history by getting information from a society
568.476	that's way beyond our own.
570.05	Now, you might find that a bit hyperbolic, and maybe it is,
573.001	but nonetheless, it's conceivable that this will happen,
575.654	and, you know, you could consider this like, I don't know,
578.027	giving Julius Caesar English lessons and the key
580.496	to the library of Congress.
581.603	It would change his day, all right?
584.058	That's one thing. Another thing that's for sure
586.053	going to happen is that it will calibrate us.
589.553	We will know that we're not that miracle, right,
593.491	that we're just another duck in a row,
595.053	we're not the only kids on the block, and I think that that's
597.048	philosophically a very profound thing to learn.
600.002	We're not a miracle, okay?
603.103	The third thing that it might tell you is somewhat vague,
606.402	but I think interesting and important,
608.525	and that is, if you find a signal coming from a more
610.63	advanced society, because they will be,
612.861	that will tell you something about our own possibilities,
615.513	that we're not inevitably doomed to self-destruction.
620.295	Because they survived their technology,
622.091	we could do it too.
623.203	Normally when you look out into the universe,
625.094	you're looking back in time. All right?
627.555	That's interesting to cosmologists.
629.594	But in this sense, you actually can look into the future,
633.038	hazily, but you can look into the future.
635.053	So those are all the sorts of things that would come from a detection.
640.59	Now, let me talk a little bit about something that happens
643.022	even in the meantime, and that is,
647.234	SETI, I think, is important, because it's exploration, and
652.012	it's not only exploration, it's comprehensible exploration.
654.464	Now, I gotta tell you, I'm always reading books about
657.329	explorers. I find exploration very interesting,
660.044	Arctic exploration, you know, people like Magellan,
663.025	Amundsen, Shackleton, you see Franklin down there,
666.021	Scott, all these guys. It's really nifty, exploration.
669.345	And they're just doing it because they want to explore,
671.584	"and you might say, ""Oh, that's kind of a frivolous opportunity,"""
673.7	but that's not frivolous. That's not a frivolous activity,
677.028	because, I mean, think of ants.
679.059	You know, most ants are programmed to follow one another
681.056	along in a long line, but there are a couple of ants,
683.304	maybe one percent of those ants, that are what they call
686	pioneer ants, and they're the ones that wander off.
688.175	They're the ones you find on the kitchen countertop.
690.076	You gotta get them with your thumb before they
692.074	find the sugar or something.
693.658	But those ants, even though most of them get wiped out,
696.063	those ants are the ones that are essential to the survival
699.355	of the hive. So exploration is important.
702.929	I also think that exploration is important in terms of
706.309	being able to address what I think is a critical
711.179	lack in our society, and that is the lack of science literacy,
714.38	the lack of the ability to even understand science.
718.023	Now, look, a lot has been written about the
720.065	deplorable state of science literacy in this country.
723.463	You've heard about it.
726.015	Well, here's one example, in fact.
728.067	Polls taken, this poll was taken 10 years ago.
730.386	It shows like roughly one third of the public thinks
732.515	that aliens are not only out there, we're looking for them
734.479	out there, but they're here, right?
736.097	Sailing the skies in their saucers and occasionally
738.396	abducting people for experiments their parents wouldn't approve of.
741.512	Well, that would be interesting if it was true,
744.685	and job security for me, but I don't think the evidence is
746.564	very good. That's more, you know, sad than significant.
750.036	But there are other things that people believe
752.055	that are significant, like the efficacy of homeopathy,
755.466	or that evolution is just, you know, sort of a crazy idea
759.017	by scientists without any legs, or, you know, evolution,
762.048	all that sort of thing, or global warming.
764.604	These sorts of ideas don't really have any validity,
768.005	that you can't trust the scientists.
770.08	Now, we've got to solve that problem, because that's
772.323	a critically important problem, and you might say,
776.401	"""Well, okay, how are we gonna solve that problem with SETI?"""
779.03	Well, let me suggest to you that SETI obviously can't
781.429	solve the problem, but it can address the problem.
783.092	It can address the problem by getting young people
786.035	interested in science. Look, science is hard, it
789.033	has a reputation of being hard, and the facts are, it is hard,
792.086	and that's the result of 400 years of science, right?
797.021	I mean, in the 18th century, in the 18th century
799.5	you could become an expert on any field of science
802.09	in an afternoon by going to a library,
805.004	if you could find the library, right?
807.025	In the 19th century, if you had a basement lab,
810.641	you could make major scientific discoveries
813.388	in your own home. Right? Because there was all this
815.613	science just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up.
818.488	Now, that's not true anymore.
820.081	Today, you've got to spend years in grad school
822.509	and post-doc positions just to figure out what
826.007	the important questions are.
828.063	It's hard. There's no doubt about it.
830.058	And in fact, here's an example: the Higgs boson,
832.367	finding the Higgs boson.
834.276	Ask the next 10 people you see on the streets,
836.076	"""Hey, do you think it's worthwhile to spend billions"
838.414	"of Swiss francs looking for the Higgs boson?"""
841.055	And I bet the answer you're going to get, is,
843.376	"""Well, I don't know what the Higgs boson is,"
845.033	"and I don't know if it's important."""
846.265	And probably most of the people wouldn't even know
848.064	the value of a Swiss franc, okay?
850.511	And yet we're spending billions of Swiss francs on this problem.
853.041	Okay? So that doesn't get people interested in science
855.194	because they can't comprehend what it's about.
857.07	SETI, on the other hand, is really simple.
858.687	We're going to use these big antennas and we're going to
860.303	try to eavesdrop on signals. Everybody can understand that.
863.055	Yes, technologically, it's very sophisticated,
865.064	but everybody gets the idea.
867.07	So that's one thing. The other thing is, it's exciting science.
871.008	It's exciting because we're naturally interested
873.422	in other intelligent beings, and I think that's
875.647	part of our hardwiring.
877.071	I mean, we're hardwired to be interested
878.631	in beings that might be, if you will, competitors,
881.432	or if you're the romantic sort, possibly even mates. Okay?
885.015	I mean, this is analogous to our interest in things that
887.026	have big teeth. Right?
889.047	We're interested in things that have big teeth, and you
890.521	can see the evolutionary value of that, and you can also see
893.066	the practical consequences by watching Animal Planet.
896.754	You notice they make very few programs about gerbils.
899.088	It's mostly about things that have big teeth.
901.144	Okay, so we're interested in these sorts of things.
904.091	And not just us. It's also kids.
908.026	This allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a
911.453	hook to science, because SETI involves all kinds of science,
914.685	obviously biology, obviously astronomy,
916.675	but also geology, also chemistry, various scientific
920.009	disciplines all can be presented in the guise of,
924.009	"""We're looking for E.T."""
925.338	So to me this is interesting and important, and in fact,
929.795	it's my policy, even though I give a lot of talks to adults,
933.033	you give talks to adults, and two days later they're back where they were.
935.701	But if you give talks to kids, you know,
938.623	one in 50 of them, some light bulb goes off, and they think,
942.775	"""Gee, I'd never thought of that,"" and then they go,"
944.576	you know, read a book or a magazine or whatever.
946.368	They get interested in something.
948.05	Now it's my theory, supported only by anecdotal,
953.024	personal anecdotal evidence, but nonetheless,
955.047	that kids get interested in something between the ages
957.52	of eight and 11. You've got to get them there.
960.056	So, all right, I give talks to adults, that's fine, but I try
962.676	and make 10 percent of the talks that I give,
965.001	I try and make those for kids.
967.078	I remember when a guy came to our high school, actually,
970.054	it was actually my junior high school. I was in sixth grade.
973.03	And he gave some talk. All I remember from it
975.51	was one word: electronics.
977.085	"It was like Dustin Hoffman in ""The Graduate,"" right,"
979.646	"when he said ""plastics,"" whatever that means, plastics."
982.044	All right, so the guy said electronics. I don't remember
984.039	anything else. In fact, I don't remember anything
986.043	that my sixth grade teacher said all year,
988.053	but I remember electronics.
990.067	And so I got interested in electronics, and you know,
992.719	I studied to get my ham license. I was wiring up stuff.
995.044	Here I am at about 15 or something, doing that sort of stuff.
998.022	Okay? That had a big effect on me.
999.605	So that's my point, that you can have a big effect
1001.317	on these kids.
1004.033	In fact, this reminds me, I don't know, a couple years ago
1007.694	I gave a talk at a school in Palo Alto
1011.02	where there were about a dozen 11-year-olds
1013.033	that had come to this talk.
1014.005	I had been brought in to talk to these kids for an hour.
1016.521	Eleven-year-olds, they're all sitting in a little semi-circle
1018.795	looking up at me with big eyes, and I started,
1021.039	there was a white board behind me, and I started off
1022.695	by writing a one with 22 zeroes after it, and I said,
1025.533	"""All right, now look, this is the number of stars"
1027.896	in the visible universe, and this number is so big
1030.768	"there's not even a name for it."""
1034.116	And one of these kids shot up his hand, and he said,
1036.581	"""Well, actually there is a name for it."
1038.086	"It's a sextra-quadra-hexa-something or other."" Right?"
1041.02	Now, that kid was wrong by four orders of magnitude,
1045.016	but there was no doubt about it, these kids were smart.
1047.488	Okay? So I stopped giving the lecture.
1049.456	All they wanted to do was ask questions.
1052.039	In fact, my last comments to these kids, at the end I said,
1056.031	"""You know, you kids are smarter"
1058.063	"than the people I work with."" Now — (Laughter)"
1063.005	They didn't even care about that.
1064.334	What they wanted was my email address
1067.028	so they could ask me more questions. (Laughter)
1071.013	Let me just say, look, my job is a privilege
1074.172	because we're in a special time.
1075.795	Previous generations couldn't do this experiment at all.
1078.58	In another generation down the line,
1080.405	I think we will have succeeded.
1082.021	So to me, it is a privilege, and when I look in the mirror,
1085.502	the facts are that I really don't see myself.
1088.309	What I see is the generation behind me.
1090.073	These are some kids from the Huff School, fourth graders.
1092.099	I talked there, what, two weeks ago, something like that.
1095.044	I think that if you can instill some interest in science
1099.654	and how it works, well, that's a payoff
1102.613	beyond easy measure. Thank you very much.
1105.056	(Applause)
