13.008	When people think about cities,
14.698	they tend to think of certain things.
17	They think of buildings and streets
19.06	and skyscrapers, noisy cabs.
21.956	But when I think about cities,
23.89	I think about people.
25.691	Cities are fundamentally about people,
29.161	and where people go
31.005	and where people meet
32.52	are at the core of what makes a city work.
35.85	So even more important than buildings in a city
39.03	are the public spaces in between them.
42.038	And today, some of the most transformative
44.696	changes in cities
46.373	are happening in these public spaces.
49.559	So I believe that lively, enjoyable public spaces
53.752	are the key to planning a great city.
56.872	They are what makes it come alive.
60.292	But what makes a public space work?
63.972	What attracts people to successful public spaces,
67.523	and what is it about unsuccessful places
69.945	that keeps people away?
72.625	I thought, if I could answer those questions,
75.984	I could make a huge contribution to my city.
79.764	But one of the more wonky things about me
81.918	is that I am an animal behaviorist,
85.469	and I use those skills not to study animal behavior
89.046	but to study how people in cities
91.98	use city public spaces.
94.228	One of the first spaces that I studied
97.549	was this little vest pocket park called Paley Park
100.954	in midtown Manhattan.
103.262	This little space became a small phenomenon,
107.387	and because it had such a profound impact
110.255	on New Yorkers,
111.471	it made an enormous impression on me.
115.555	I studied this park very early on in my career
118.052	because it happened to have been built
119.638	by my stepfather,
121.416	so I knew that places like Paley Park
124.048	didn't happen by accident.
126.448	I saw firsthand that they required
129	incredible dedication
130.456	and enormous attention to detail.
133.514	But what was it about this space
135.248	that made it special and drew people to it?
139.05	Well, I would sit in the park and watch very carefully,
141.951	and first among other things
143.843	were the comfortable, movable chairs.
146.906	People would come in, find their own seat,
149.416	move it a bit, actually, and then stay a while,
152.81	and then interestingly,
154.658	people themselves attracted other people,
157.633	and ironically, I felt more peaceful
160.41	if there were other people around.
162.391	And it was green.
164.281	This little park provided what New Yorkers crave:
168.042	comfort and greenery.
170.58	But my question was,
172.268	why weren't there more places with greenery
175.33	and places to sit in the middle of the city
177.839	where you didn't feel alone,
180.319	or like a trespasser?
182.776	Unfortunately, that's not how cities
185.008	were being designed.
187.026	So here you see a familiar sight.
190.72	This is how plazas have been
190.72	designed for generations.
195.001	They have that stylish, Spartan look
198.131	that we often associate with modern architecture,
201.951	but it's not surprising that people
204.262	avoid spaces like this.
206.124	They not only look desolate,
208.234	they feel downright dangerous.
210.946	I mean, where would you sit here?
214.223	What would you do here?
216.769	But architects love them.
220.245	They are plinths for their creations.
223.518	They might tolerate a sculpture or two,
225.451	but that's about it.
227.204	And for developers, they are ideal.
230.408	There's nothing to water, nothing to maintain,
232.995	and no undesirable people to worry about.
236.955	But don't you think this is a waste?
240.199	For me, becoming a city planner
242.52	meant being able to truly change the city
245.192	that I lived in and loved.
247.682	I wanted to be able to create places
250.17	that would give you the feeling that you got
252.135	in Paley Park,
253.673	and not allow developers to
253.673	build bleak plazas like this.
258.461	But over the many years,
259.876	I have learned how hard it is
262.472	to create successful, meaningful,
265.06	enjoyable public spaces.
267.088	As I learned from my stepfather,
268.665	they certainly do not happen by accident,
270.953	especially in a city like New York,
273.781	where public space has to
273.781	be fought for to begin with,
277.06	and then for them to be successful,
279.168	somebody has to think very hard
281.19	about every detail.
283.214	Now, open spaces in cities are opportunities.
287.16	Yes, they are opportunities
287.16	for commercial investment,
290.964	but they are also opportunities for the common good
294.533	of the city,
296.299	and those two goals are often
296.299	not aligned with one another,
299.814	and therein lies the conflict.
302.423	The first opportunity I had to fight
305.075	for a great public open space was in the early 1980s,
308.237	when I was leading a team of planners
310.575	at a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City
313.887	in lower Manhattan on the Hudson River.
316.5	And this sandy wasteland had lain barren
319.314	for 10 years,
320.764	and we were told, unless we found a developer
323.408	in six months, it would go bankrupt.
325.536	So we came up with a radical,
327.537	almost insane idea.
329.927	Instead of building a park
331.775	as a complement to future development,
334.283	why don't we reverse that equation
336.368	and build a small but very high-quality
339.421	public open space first,
341.406	and see if that made a difference.
344.412	So we only could afford to build a two-block section
348.11	of what would become a mile-long esplanade,
351.57	so whatever we built had to be perfect.
354.537	So just to make sure, I insisted
357.533	that we build a mock-up
359.75	in wood, at scale, of the railing and the sea wall.
363.684	And when I sat down on that test bench
366.708	with sand still swirling all around me,
369.906	the railing hit exactly at eye level,
372.999	blocking my view and ruining my experience
375.99	at the water's edge.
378.12	So you see, details really do make a difference.
381.427	But design is not just how something looks,
385.358	it's how your body feels on that seat in that space,
391.25	and I believe that successful design always depends
394.39	on that very individual experience.
397.815	In this photo, everything looks very finished,
402.186	but that granite edge, those lights,
404.904	the back on that bench,
406.792	the trees in planting,
408.486	and the many different kinds of places to sit
411.089	were all little battles that turned this project
414.271	into a place that people wanted to be.
418.315	Now, this proved very valuable 20 years later
422.15	when Michael Bloomberg asked me to be
424.158	his planning commissioner
425.74	and put me in charge of shaping
427.587	the entire city of New York.
429.658	And he said to me on that very day,
431.757	he said that New York was projected
433.853	to grow from eight to nine million people.
436.91	And he asked me,
438.44	"""So where are you going to put"
440.283	"one million additional New Yorkers?"""
442.999	Well, I didn't have any idea.
445.644	Now, you know that New York does
448.683	place a high value on attracting immigrants,
451.381	so we were excited about the prospect of growth,
454.301	but honestly, where were we going to grow
457.18	in a city that was already built out to its edges
460.574	and surrounded by water?
463.374	How were we going to find housing
464.976	for that many new New Yorkers?
467.274	And if we couldn't spread out,
469.087	which was probably a good thing,
470.901	where could new housing go?
473.72	And what about cars?
475.353	Our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars.
479.465	So what were we going to do?
482.299	If we couldn't spread out, we had to go up.
486.276	And if we had to go up,
487.31	we had to go up in places
489.092	where you wouldn't need to own a car.
491.101	So that meant using one of our greatest assets:
493.964	our transit system.
496.416	But we had never before thought
497.989	of how we could make the most of it.
500.225	So here was the answer to our puzzle.
503.438	If we were to channel and redirect
507.069	all new development around transit,
509.363	we could actually handle that population increase,
512.99	we thought.
514.264	And so here was the plan,
516.822	what we really needed to do:
518.47	We needed to redo our zoning --
521.318	and zoning is the city planner's regulatory tool --
524.669	and basically reshape the entire city,
527.98	targeting where new development could go
530.125	and prohibiting any development at all
532.316	in our car-oriented,
534.03	suburban-style neighborhoods.
536.192	Well, this was an unbelievably ambitious idea,
539.924	ambitious because communities
542.5	had to approve those plans.
546.115	So how was I going to get this done?
549.134	By listening. So I began listening,
552.042	in fact, thousands of hours of listening
555.396	just to establish trust.
557.214	You know, communities can tell
559.303	whether or not you understand their neighborhoods.
561.455	It's not something you can just fake.
564.551	And so I began walking.
567.257	I can't tell you how many blocks I walked,
569.577	in sweltering summers, in freezing winters,
572.986	year after year,
574.816	just so I could get to understand
576.904	the DNA of each neighborhood
578.931	and know what each street felt like.
581.506	I became an incredibly geeky zoning expert,
585.001	finding ways that zoning could address
587.07	communities' concerns.
589.132	So little by little, neighborhood by neighborhood,
591.704	block by block,
593.139	we began to set height limits
595.012	so that all new development
596.744	would be predictable and near transit.
600.361	Over the course of 12 years,
602.142	we were able to rezone
617.735	is within a 10-minute walk of a subway.
620.383	In other words, nobody in those new buildings
623.033	needs to own a car.
624.909	Well, those rezonings were exhausting
629.002	and enervating and important,
632.04	but rezoning was never my mission.
634.59	You can't see zoning and you can't feel zoning.
638.081	My mission was always to create
640.169	great public spaces.
642.093	So in the areas where we zoned
642.093	for significant development,
645.985	I was determined to create places
648.176	that would make a difference in people's lives.
650.87	Here you see what was
652.956	two miles of abandoned, degraded waterfront
655.38	in the neighborhoods of Greenpoint
657.147	and Williamsburg in Brooklyn,
658.929	impossible to get to and impossible to use.
662.489	Now the zoning here was massive,
664.983	so I felt an obligation to create
668.005	magnificent parks on these waterfronts,
671.03	and I spent an incredible amount of time
673.77	on every square inch of these plans.
676.875	I wanted to make sure that there were
678.94	tree-lined paths from the upland to the water,
681.479	that there were trees and plantings everywhere,
683.89	and, of course, lots and lots of places to sit.
688.078	Honestly, I had no idea how it would turn out.
691.448	I had to have faith.
693.073	But I put everything that I had studied and learned
696.036	into those plans.
697.77	And then it opened,
699.43	and I have to tell you, it was incredible.
702.717	People came from all over the city
704.802	to be in these parks.
706.459	I know they changed the lives
706.459	of the people who live there,
709.879	but they also changed New Yorkers' whole image
712.374	of their city.
714.15	I often come down and watch people
715.729	get on this little ferry
717.245	that now runs between the boroughs,
719.223	and I can't tell you why,
720.71	but I'm completely moved
722.282	by the fact that people are using it
724.429	as if it had always been there.
726.611	And here is a new park in lower Manhattan.
729.884	Now, the water's edge in lower Manhattan
732.641	was a complete mess before 9/11.
735.574	Wall Street was essentially landlocked
737.489	because you couldn't get anywhere near this edge.
740.075	And after 9/11, the city had very little control.
743.909	But I thought if we went
745.454	to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation
747.599	and got money to reclaim this two miles
750.56	of degraded waterfront
752.356	that it would have an enormous effect
754.207	on the rebuilding of lower Manhattan.
756.668	And it did.
757.848	Lower Manhattan finally has a public waterfront
761.239	on all three sides.
763.353	I really love this park.
765.737	You know, railings have to be higher now,
767.962	so we put bar seating at the edge,
770.506	and you can get so close to the water
772.618	you're practically on it.
774.346	And see how the railing widens
776.215	and flattens out so you can lay down
777.631	your lunch or your laptop.
779.513	And I love when people come there
781.493	and look up and they say,
783.353	"""Wow, there's Brooklyn, and it's so close."""
787.38	So what's the trick?
789.732	How do you turn a park
791.541	into a place that people want to be?
794.707	Well, it's up to you,
797.55	not as a city planner but as a human being.
800.915	You don't tap into your design expertise.
804.315	You tap into your humanity.
807.83	I mean, would you want to go there?
811.156	Would you want to stay there?
813.139	Can you see into it and out of it?
815.277	Are there other people there?
817.529	Does it seem green and friendly?
820.176	Can you find your very own seat?
823.414	Well now, all over New York City,
826.443	there are places where you can
827.947	find your very own seat.
829.801	Where there used to be parking spaces,
832.323	there are now pop-up cafes.
834.616	Where Broadway traffic used to run,
836.594	there are now tables and chairs.
838.558	Where 12 years ago, sidewalk
838.558	cafes were not allowed,
842.112	they are now everywhere.
844.085	But claiming these spaces for public use
847.08	was not simple,
848.219	and it's even harder to keep them that way.
850.881	So now I'm going to tell you a story
852.57	about a very unusual park called the High Line.
856.85	The High Line was an elevated railway.
858.904	(Applause)
865.535	The High Line was an elevated railway
867.811	that ran through three neighborhoods
869.623	on Manhattan's West Side,
871.493	and when the train stopped running,
873.238	it became a self-seeded landscape,
875.394	a kind of a garden in the sky.
878.001	And when I saw it the first time,
880.15	honestly, when I went up on that old viaduct,
882.796	I fell in love the way you fall in love with a person,
885.612	honestly.
886.839	And when I was appointed,
888.96	saving the first two sections of the High Line
891.036	from demolition became my first priority
894.408	and my most important project.
897.08	I knew if there was a day that I didn't
900.348	worry about the High Line, it would come down.
903.951	And the High Line,
905.94	even though it is widely known now
908.4	and phenomenally popular,
910.219	it is the most contested public space in the city.
914.123	You might see a beautiful park,
916.998	but not everyone does.
919.445	You know, it's true, commercial interests
922.082	will always battle against public space.
925.299	You might say,
927.123	"""How wonderful it is that more than"
928.693	four million people come from all over the world
931.124	"to visit the High Line."""
932.771	Well, a developer sees just one thing: customers.
937.387	Hey, why not take out those plantings
940.112	and have shops all along the High Line?
942.12	Wouldn't that be terrific
943.617	and won't it mean a lot more money for the city?
946.152	Well no, it would not be terrific.
948.644	It would be a mall, and not a park.
951.943	(Applause)
959.322	And you know what, it might mean
960.83	more money for the city,
963.04	but a city has to take the long view,
967.089	the view for the common good.
970.025	Most recently, the last section of the High Line,
973.74	the third section of the High Line,
975.356	the final section of the High Line,
976.926	has been pitted against development interests,
979.728	where some of the city's leading developers
982.028	are building more than 17 million square feet
984.71	at the Hudson Yards.
987.01	And they came to me and proposed
988.971	"that they ""temporarily disassemble"""
991.53	that third and final section.
994.26	Perhaps the High Line didn't fit in
996.723	with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers
999.61	on a hill.
1001.073	Perhaps it was just in their way.
1003.797	But in any case, it took nine months
1006.285	of nonstop daily negotiation
1008.759	to finally get the signed agreement
1010.772	to prohibit its demolition,
1012.796	and that was only two years ago.
1016.605	So you see, no matter how popular
1019.063	and successful a public space may be,
1021.899	it can never be taken for granted.
1024.315	Public spaces always -- this is it saved --
1026.896	public spaces always need vigilant champions,
1030.608	not only to claim them at the outset for public use,
1034.308	but to design them for the people that use them,
1037.839	then to maintain them to ensure
1039.87	that they are for everyone,
1041.84	that they are not violated, invaded,
1044.253	abandoned or ignored.
1046.89	If there is any one lesson
1048.534	that I have learned in my life as a city planner,
1051.686	it is that public spaces have power.
1055.446	It's not just the number of people using them,
1058.515	it's the even greater number of people
1060.469	who feel better about their city
1062.588	just knowing that they are there.
1065.82	Public space can change how you live in a city,
1069.292	how you feel about a city,
1071.462	whether you choose one city over another,
1074.75	and public space is one of
1074.75	the most important reasons
1077.521	why you stay in a city.
1080.642	I believe that a successful city
1083.107	is like a fabulous party.
1085.728	People stay because they are having a great time.
1089.633	Thank you.
1091.576	(Applause)
1097.529	Thank you. (Applause)
