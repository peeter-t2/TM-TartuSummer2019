12.731	Miranda Wang: We're here
12.731	to talk about accidents.
15.195	How do you feel about accidents?
17.627	When we think about accidents,
19.221	we usually consider them to be harmful,
21.412	unfortunate or even dangerous,
21.412	and they certainly can be.
25.739	But are they always that bad?
28.029	The discovery that had led
28.029	to penicillin, for example,
30.672	is one of the most fortunate
30.672	accidents of all time.
34.109	Without biologist Alexander
34.109	Fleming's moldy accident,
37.796	caused by a neglected workstation,
39.924	we wouldn't be able to fight
39.924	off so many bacterial infections.
44.276	Jeanny Yao: Miranda and I are here today
46.205	because we'd like to share
46.205	how our accidents
48.445	have led to discoveries.
50.605	In 2011, we visited the Vancouver
50.605	Waste Transfer Station
54.133	and saw an enormous pit of plastic waste.
57.642	We realized that when
57.642	plastics get to the dump,
60.007	it's difficult to sort them
60.007	because they have similar densities,
63.363	and when they're mixed with organic matter
65.387	and construction debris,
65.387	it's truly impossible
67.735	to pick them out and environmentally
67.735	eliminate them.
70.789	MW: However, plastics are useful
73.229	because they're durable, flexible,
75.341	and can be easily molded
75.341	into so many useful shapes.
78.613	The downside of this convenience
80.669	is that there's a high cost to this.
83.078	Plastics cause serious problems, such as
85.318	the destruction of ecosystems,
87.509	the pollution of natural resources,
89.2	and the reduction of available land space.
91.945	This picture you see here
91.945	is the Great Pacific Gyre.
94.589	When you think about plastic pollution
96.894	and the marine environment,
98.214	we think about the Great Pacific Gyre,
100.048	which is supposed to be a floating
100.048	island of plastic waste.
103.237	But that's no longer an accurate depiction
105.48	of plastic pollution
105.48	in the marine environment.
108.461	Right now, the ocean is actually
108.461	a soup of plastic debris,
112.172	and there's nowhere you
112.172	can go in the ocean
114.445	where you wouldn't be able
114.445	to find plastic particles.
117.936	JY: In a plastic-dependent society,
120.105	cutting down production is a good
120.105	goal, but it's not enough.
123.084	And what about the waste
123.084	that's already been produced?
126.325	Plastics take hundreds to thousands
126.325	of years to biodegrade.
130.053	So we thought, you know what?
131.666	Instead of waiting for that garbage
131.666	to sit there and pile up,
135.072	let's find a way to break them down
137.488	with bacteria.
139.546	Sounds cool, right?
141.18	Audience: Yeah. JY: Thank you.
142.971	But we had a problem.
144.293	You see, plastics have
144.293	very complex structures
147.997	and are difficult to biodegrade.
150.141	Anyhow, we were curious and hopeful
152.322	and still wanted to give it a go.
153.942	MW: With this idea in mind,
153.942	Jeanny and I read through
156.128	some hundreds of scientific
156.128	articles on the Internet,
158.717	and we drafted a research proposal
160.989	in the beginning of our grade 12 year.
163.237	We aimed to find bacteria
163.237	from our local Fraser River
166.495	that can degrade a harmful
166.495	plasticizer called phthalates.
170.086	Phthalates are additives used
170.086	in everyday plastic products
172.872	to increase their flexibility,
172.872	durability and transparency.
177.305	Although they're part of the plastic,
179.237	they're not covalently bonded
179.237	to the plastic backbone.
181.889	As a result, they easily
181.889	escape into our environment.
184.869	Not only do phthalates
184.869	pollute our environment,
187.503	but they also pollute our bodies.
189.436	To make the matter worse,
189.436	phthalates are found in products
192.442	to which we have a high
192.442	exposure, such as babies' toys,
196.218	beverage containers, cosmetics,
196.218	and even food wraps.
200.708	Phthalates are horrible because
202.564	they're so easily taken into our bodies.
204.689	They can be absorbed by skin
204.689	contact, ingested, and inhaled.
209.027	JY: Every year, at least 470
209.027	million pounds of phthalates
212.939	contaminate our air, water and soil.
216.328	The Environmental Protection Agency
218.019	even classified this group
218.019	as a top-priority pollutant
220.98	because it's been shown to cause
220.98	cancer and birth defects
224.036	by acting as a hormone disruptor.
226.432	We read that each year,
226.432	the Vancouver municipal government
229.218	monitors phthalate
229.218	concentration levels in rivers
231.63	to assess their safety.
233.38	So we figured, if there
233.38	are places along our Fraser River
236.69	that are contaminated with phthalates,
238.773	and if there are bacteria
238.773	that are able to live in these areas,
241.987	then perhaps, perhaps these
241.987	bacteria could have evolved
245.893	to break down phthalates.
247.989	MW: So we presented this good idea
250.061	to Dr. Lindsay Eltis at the University
250.061	of British Columbia,
253.052	and surprisingly, he actually
253.052	took us into his lab
256.272	and asked his graduate students
256.272	Adam and James to help us.
260.537	Little did we know at that time
262.246	that a trip to the dump
262.246	and some research on the Internet
265.831	and plucking up the courage
265.831	to act upon inspiration
268.324	would take us on a life-changing journey
270.716	of accidents and discoveries.
273.124	JY: The first step in our project
275.186	was to collect soil samples
275.186	from three different sites
277.782	along the Fraser River.
279.254	Out of thousands of bacteria,
279.254	we wanted to find ones
282.127	that could break down phthalates,
283.449	so we enriched our cultures
283.449	with phthalates
285.608	as the only carbon source.
287.256	This implied that, if anything
287.256	grew in our cultures,
289.757	then they must be able
289.757	to live off of phthalates.
292.21	Everything went well from there,
294.1	and we became amazing scientists.
294.1	(Laughter)
297.253	MW: Um... uh, Jeanny. JY: I'm just joking.
300.121	MW: Okay. Well, it was partially my fault.
302.816	You see, I accidentally cracked the flask
305.986	that had contained our third
305.986	enrichment culture,
307.767	and as a result, we had to wipe
307.767	down the incubator room
310.612	with bleach and ethanol twice.
312.316	And this is only one of the examples
312.316	of the many accidents
315.102	that happened during our experimentation.
317.327	But this mistake turned
317.327	out to be rather serendipitous.
320.827	We noticed that the unharmed cultures
323.043	came from places
323.043	of opposite contamination levels,
326.243	so this mistake actually
326.243	led us to think that
328.775	perhaps we can compare
330.435	the different degradative
330.435	potentials of bacteria
333.187	from sites
333.187	of opposite contamination levels.
337.158	JY: Now that we grew the bacteria,
339.084	we wanted to isolate strains
339.084	by streaking onto mediate plates,
342.42	because we thought that would be
344.276	less accident-prone,
344.276	but we were wrong again.
347.764	We poked holes in our agar while streaking
351.597	and contaminated some samples and funghi.
353.866	As a result, we had to streak
353.866	and restreak several times.
356.605	Then we monitored phthalate utilization
359.273	and bacterial growth,
361.095	and found that they shared
361.095	an inverse correlation,
363.735	so as bacterial populations increased,
366.322	phthalate concentrations decreased.
368.16	This means that our bacteria were
368.16	actually living off of phthalates.
372.192	MW: So now that we found bacteria
372.192	that could break down phthalates,
375.407	we wondered what these bacteria were.
377.699	So Jeanny and I took
377.699	three of our most efficient strains
380.39	and then performed gene
380.39	amplification sequencing on them
383.147	and matched our data with an online
383.147	comprehensive database.
386.275	We were happy to see that,
387.948	although our three strains had
387.948	been previously identified bacteria,
391.564	two of them were not previously associated
394.587	with phthalate degradation, so this
394.587	was actually a novel discovery.
398.621	JY: To better understand
398.621	how this biodegradation works,
402.674	we wanted to verify the catabolic
402.674	pathways of our three strains.
406.326	To do this, we extracted
406.326	enzymes from our bacteria
409.238	and reacted with an intermediate
409.238	of phthalic acid.
412.806	MW: We monitored this experiment
412.806	with spectrophotometry
415.958	and obtained this beautiful graph.
418.203	This graph shows
418.203	that our bacteria really do have
420.613	a genetic pathway
420.613	to biodegrade phthalates.
423.251	Our bacteria can transform phthalates,
423.251	which is a harmful toxin,
426.613	into end products such
426.613	as carbon dioxide, water
429.021	and alcohol.
430.26	I know some of you
430.26	in the crowd are thinking,
432.427	well, carbon dioxide is horrible,
432.427	it's a greenhouse gas.
435.282	But if our bacteria did not
435.282	evolve to break down phthalates,
438.576	they would have used some other
438.576	kind of carbon source,
441.172	and aerobic respiration would have led it
443.235	to have end products such
443.235	as carbon dioxide anyway.
446.547	We were also interested to see that,
448.849	although we've obtained greater diversity
451.008	of bacteria biodegraders
451.008	from the bird habitat site,
453.978	we obtained the most efficient
453.978	degraders from the landfill site.
457.05	So this fully shows that nature evolves
459.431	through natural selection.
462.672	JY: So Miranda and I shared this research
464.769	at the Sanofi BioGENEius Challenge
464.769	competition and were recognized
467.948	with the greatest
467.948	commercialization potential.
470.984	Although we're not the first
470.984	ones to find bacteria
473.12	that can break down phthalates,
474.621	we were the first ones
474.621	to look into our local river
477.119	and find a possible solution
477.119	to a local problem.
480.831	We have not only shown that bacteria
483.132	can be the solution to plastic
483.132	pollution, but also that
486.544	being open to uncertain
486.544	outcomes and taking risks
489.845	create opportunities
489.845	for unexpected discoveries.
493.12	Throughout this journey, we have also
493.12	discovered our passion for science,
496.621	and are currently continuing research
498.463	on other fossil fuel
498.463	chemicals in university.
501.954	We hope that in the near future,
503.502	we'll be able to create model organisms
505.905	that can break down not only phthalates
507.787	but a wide variety
507.787	of different contaminants.
511.456	We can apply this to wastewater
511.456	treatment plants
514.152	to clean up our rivers
515.64	and other natural resources.
517.976	And perhaps one day
517.976	we'll be able to tackle
520.515	the problem of solid plastic waste.
524.553	MW: I think our journey
524.553	has truly transformed
526.888	our view of microorganisms,
528.953	and Jeanny and I have shown that
530.501	even mistakes can lead to discoveries.
532.644	Einstein once said,
533.934	"""You can't solve problems"
533.934	by using the same kind
536.321	of thinking you used
536.321	"when you created them."""
539.589	If we're making plastic
539.589	synthetically, then we think
542.582	the solution would be to break
542.582	them down biochemically.
546.556	Thank you. JY: Thank you.
548.5	(Applause)
