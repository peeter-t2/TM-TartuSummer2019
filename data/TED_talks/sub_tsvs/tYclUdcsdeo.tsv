16.395	Everyone is both a learner
18.371	and a teacher.
19.883	This is me being inspired
22.339	by my first tutor,
23.53	my mom,
24.475	and this is me teaching
27.098	Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
29.051	to 200 students
30.291	at Stanford University.
31.563	Now the students and I
33.019	enjoyed the class,
34.195	but it occurred to me
35.611	that while the subject matter
37.322	of the class is advanced
38.611	and modern,
39.299	the teaching technology isn't.
41.618	In fact, I use basically
43.954	the same technology as
46.324	this 14th-century classroom.
48.954	Note the textbook,
51.754	the sage on the stage,
54.698	and the sleeping guy
56.597	in the back. (Laughter)
57.498	Just like today.
60.435	So my co-teacher,
63.546	Sebastian Thrun, and I thought,
65.186	there must be a better way.
66.96	We challenged ourselves
68.614	to create an online class
69.905	that would be equal or better
71.536	in quality to our Stanford class,
73.872	but to bring it to anyone
76.082	in the world for free.
77.712	We announced the class on July 29th,
80.28	and within two weeks, 50,000 people
83.489	had signed up for it.
84.896	And that grew to 160,000 students
88.001	from 209 countries.
90.065	We were thrilled to have
91.873	that kind of audience,
92.994	and just a bit terrified that we
95.633	hadn't finished preparing the class yet. (Laughter)
97.944	So we got to work.
99.556	We studied what others had done,
101.192	what we could copy and what we could change.
103.515	Benjamin Bloom had showed
106.176	that one-on-one tutoring works best,
107.985	so that's what we tried to emulate,
110.113	like with me and my mom,
111.553	even though we knew
113.058	it would be one-on-thousands.
114.976	Here, an overhead video camera
117.177	is recording me as I'm talking
119.009	and drawing on a piece of paper.
120.688	"A student said, ""This class felt"
123.097	like sitting in a bar
124.249	with a really smart friend
125.728	who's explaining something
126.932	"you haven't grasped, but are about to."""
129.233	And that's exactly what we were aiming for.
131.349	Now, from Khan Academy, we saw
134.137	that short 10-minute videos
135.961	worked much better than trying
137.737	to record an hour-long lecture
139.808	and put it on the small-format screen.
142.225	We decided to go even shorter
144.417	and more interactive.
146.065	Our typical video is two minutes,
148.312	sometimes shorter, never more
150.064	than six, and then we pause for
152.753	a quiz question, to make it
154.12	feel like one-on-one tutoring.
155.998	Here, I'm explaining how a computer uses
158.4	the grammar of English
159.648	to parse sentences, and here,
161.825	there's a pause and the student
163.889	has to reflect, understand what's going on
166.126	and check the right boxes
167.766	before they can continue.
169.183	Students learn best when
171.631	they're actively practicing.
172.879	We wanted to engage them, to have them grapple
175.175	with ambiguity and guide them to synthesize
178.143	the key ideas themselves.
179.808	We mostly avoid questions
181.52	"like, ""Here's a formula, now"
183.231	tell me the value of Y
184.306	"when X is equal to two."""
185.518	We preferred open-ended questions.
187.335	"One student wrote, ""Now I'm seeing"
190.513	Bayes networks and examples of
192.375	"game theory everywhere I look."""
193.943	And I like that kind of response.
195.681	That's just what we were going for.
197.487	We didn't want students to memorize the formulas;
199.681	we wanted to change the way
200.871	they looked at the world.
201.961	And we succeeded.
203.287	Or, I should say, the students succeeded.
205.687	And it's a little bit ironic
207.606	that we set about to disrupt traditional education,
210.519	and in doing so, we ended up
212.535	making our online class
214.119	much more like a traditional college class
216.446	than other online classes.
218.287	Most online classes, the videos are always available.
221.502	You can watch them any time you want.
223.319	But if you can do it any time,
225.606	that means you can do it tomorrow,
227.111	and if you can do it tomorrow,
228.519	well, you may not ever
230.681	get around to it. (Laughter)
232.439	So we brought back the innovation
234.631	of having due dates. (Laughter)
236.718	You could watch the videos
238.03	any time you wanted during the week,
239.942	but at the end of the week,
241.097	you had to get the homework done.
242.814	This motivated the students to keep going, and it also
244.727	meant that everybody was working
247.583	on the same thing at the same time,
249.101	so if you went into a discussion forum,
250.598	you could get an answer from a peer within minutes.
253.302	Now, I'll show you some of the forums, most of which
256.241	were self-organized by the students themselves.
259.007	From Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng, we learned
262.231	"the concept of ""flipping"" the classroom."
264.227	Students watched the videos
265.522	on their own, and then they
267.11	come together to discuss them.
268.82	From Eric Mazur, I learned about peer instruction,
271.977	that peers can be the best teachers,
274.601	because they're the ones
276.033	that remember what it's like to not understand.
278.881	Sebastian and I have forgotten some of that.
281.562	Of course, we couldn't have
283.961	a classroom discussion with
285.593	tens of thousands of students,
287.139	so we encouraged and nurtured these online forums.
290.625	And finally, from Teach For America,
293.673	I learned that a class is not
295.154	primarily about information.
296.65	More important is motivation and determination.
299.481	It was crucial that the students see
301.321	that we're working hard for them and
303.121	they're all supporting each other.
304.53	Now, the class ran 10 weeks,
307.498	and in the end, about half of the 160,000 students watched
311.409	at least one video each week,
312.972	and over 20,000 finished all the homework,
315.665	putting in 50 to 100 hours.
317.329	They got this statement of accomplishment.
318.882	So what have we learned?
321.001	Well, we tried some old ideas
323.817	and some new and put them together,
325.474	but there are more ideas to try.
327.556	Sebastian's teaching another class now.
329.37	I'll do one in the fall.
330.738	Stanford Coursera, Udacity, MITx
334.498	and others have more classes coming.
336.769	It's a really exciting time.
338.257	But to me, the most exciting
339.729	part of it is the data that we're gathering.
342.705	We're gathering thousands
345.401	of interactions per student per class,
347.057	billions of interactions altogether,
349.265	and now we can start analyzing that,
351.769	and when we learn from that,
353.233	do experimentations,
354.474	that's when the real revolution will come.
356.714	And you'll be able to see the results from
359.49	a new generation of amazing students.
361.753	(Applause)
