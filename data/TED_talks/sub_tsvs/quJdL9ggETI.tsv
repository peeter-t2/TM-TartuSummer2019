12.779	"What do you think of when I say the word ""design""?"
16.5	You probably think of things like this,
18.82	finely crafted objects that you can hold in your hand,
22.331	or maybe logos and posters and maps
25.26	that visually explain things,
27.181	classic icons of timeless design.
30.339	But I'm not here to talk about that kind of design.
33.22	I want to talk about the kind
34.375	that you probably use every day
36.404	and may not give much thought to,
38.165	designs that change all the time
40.276	and that live inside your pocket.
42.533	I'm talking about the design
44.596	of digital experiences
46.651	and specifically the design of systems
49.387	that are so big that their scale
51.02	can be hard to comprehend.
53.111	Consider the fact that Google processes
55.372	over one billion search queries every day,
59.157	that every minute, over 100 hours
61.325	of footage are uploaded to YouTube.
63.525	That's more in a single day
65.292	than all three major U.S. networks broadcast
68.042	in the last five years combined.
71.317	And Facebook transmitting the photos,
73.621	messages and stories
74.817	of over 1.23 billion people.
77.989	That's almost half of the Internet population,
80.733	and a sixth of humanity.
83.405	These are some of the products
84.419	that I've helped design over the course of my career,
87.173	and their scale is so massive
89.293	that they've produced unprecedented
91.181	design challenges.
93.027	But what is really hard
95.389	about designing at scale is this:
98.12	It's hard in part because
99.956	it requires a combination of two things,
102.861	audacity and humility â€”
105.638	audacity to believe that the thing that you're making
109.482	is something that the entire world wants and needs,
112.778	and humility to understand that as a designer,
115.874	it's not about you or your portfolio,
118.314	it's about the people that you're designing for,
120.906	and how your work just might help them
122.802	live better lives.
124.406	Now, unfortunately, there's no school
127.027	that offers the course Designing for Humanity 101.
131.12	I and the other designers
132.692	who work on these kinds of products
134.436	have had to invent it as we go along,
137.788	and we are teaching ourselves
139.405	the emerging best practices
141.273	of designing at scale,
143.253	and today I'd like share some of the things
145.205	that we've learned over the years.
147.285	Now, the first thing that you need to know
148.516	about designing at scale
149.646	is that the little things really matter.
152.62	Here's a really good example of how
154.557	a very tiny design element can make a big impact.
158.06	The team at Facebook that manages
161.14	"the Facebook ""Like"" button"
163.248	decided that it needed to be redesigned.
165.72	The button had kind of gotten out of sync
168.147	with the evolution of our brand
169.596	and it needed to be modernized.
171.384	Now you might think, well, it's a tiny little button,
173.252	it probably is a pretty straightforward,
175.245	easy design assignment, but it wasn't.
178.26	Turns out, there were all kinds of constraints
180.381	for the design of this button.
182.19	You had to work within specific
182.19	height and width parameters.
185.645	You had to be careful to make it work
187.94	in a bunch of different languages,
189.701	and be careful about using
189.701	fancy gradients or borders
192.756	because it has to degrade gracefully
194.9	in old web browsers.
196.653	The truth is, designing this tiny little button
199.325	was a huge pain in the butt.
201.508	Now, this is the new version of the button,
203.56	and the designer who led this project estimates
206.074	that he spent over 280 hours
209.588	redesigning this button over the course of months.
213.238	Now, why would we spend so much time
215.582	on something so small?
217.886	It's because when you're designing at scale,
219.502	there's no such thing as a small detail.
222.631	This innocent little button
224.147	is seen on average 22 billion times a day
228.102	and on over 7.5 million websites.
231.602	It's one of the single most viewed
231.602	design elements ever created.
235.686	Now that's a lot of pressure for a little button
238.19	and the designer behind it,
239.91	but with these kinds of products,
241.438	you need to get even the tiny things right.
244.174	Now, the next thing that you need to understand
246.71	is how to design with data.
249.198	Now, when you're working on products like this,
250.87	you have incredible amounts of information
253.615	about how people are using your product
255.703	that you can then use to influence
257.358	your design decisions,
258.942	but it's not just as simple as following the numbers.
261.694	Let me give you an example
262.945	so that you can understand what I mean.
265.11	Facebook has had a tool for a long time
267.267	that allowed people to report photos
269.58	that may be in violation of our community standards,
272.442	things like spam and abuse.
274.862	And there were a ton of photos reported,
276.87	but as it turns out,
278.506	only a small percentage were actually
280.402	in violation of those community standards.
283.32	Most of them were just your typical party photo.
285.83	Now, to give you a specific hypothetical example,
288.738	let's say my friend Laura hypothetically
291.234	uploads a picture of me
292.892	from a drunken night of karaoke.
295.88	This is purely hypothetical, I can assure you.
299.146	(Laughter)
300.641	Now, incidentally,
302.41	you know how some people are kind of worried
303.7	that their boss or employee
305.343	is going to discover embarrassing photos of them
307.35	on Facebook?
308.89	Do you know how hard that is to avoid
310.826	when you actually work at Facebook?
314.08	So anyway, there are lots of these photos
316.366	being erroneously reported as spam and abuse,
319.8	and one of the engineers on the team had a hunch.
322.249	He really thought there was something else going on
324.376	and he was right,
325.532	because when he looked
325.532	through a bunch of the cases,
327.856	he found that most of them
329.456	were from people who were requesting
331.331	the takedown of a photo of themselves.
334.153	Now this was a scenario that the team
336.193	never even took into account before.
338.56	So they added a new feature
340.369	that allowed people to message their friend
342.513	to ask them to take the photo down.
344.785	But it didn't work.
346.244	Only 20 percent of people
347.495	sent the message to their friend.
349.713	So the team went back at it.
351.964	They consulted with experts in conflict resolution.
355.155	They even studied the universal principles
358.217	of polite language,
359.704	which I didn't even actually know existed
361.239	until this research happened.
363.176	And they found something really interesting.
365.705	They had to go beyond just helping people
367.888	ask their friend to take the photo down.
369.8	They had to help people express to their friend
372.529	how the photo made them feel.
374.96	Here's how the experience works today.
377.158	So I find this hypothetical photo of myself,
380.385	and it's not spam, it's not abuse,
383.014	but I really wish it weren't on the site.
385.537	So I report it and I say,
388.761	"""I'm in this photo and I don't like it,"""
390.801	and then we dig deeper.
394.063	Why don't you like this photo of yourself?
396.569	"And I select ""It's embarrassing."""
399.416	And then I'm encouraged to message my friend,
402.742	but here's the critical difference.
404.601	I'm provided specific suggested language
408.233	that helps me communicate to Laura
410.569	how the photo makes me feel.
412.504	Now the team found that this relatively small change
415.545	had a huge impact.
417.224	Before, only 20 percent of people
419.624	were sending the message,
420.795	and now 60 percent were,
422.84	and surveys showed that people
424.474	on both sides of the conversation
426.402	felt better as a result.
428.042	That same survey showed
429.697	that 90 percent of your friends
432.05	want to know if they've done something to upset you.
434.788	Now I don't know who the other 10 percent are,
436.885	"but maybe that's where our ""Unfriend"" feature"
438.659	can come in handy.
440.22	So as you can see,
441.994	these decisions are highly nuanced.
444.602	Of course we use a lot of data
446.571	to inform our decisions,
447.882	but we also rely very heavily on iteration,
451.325	research, testing, intuition, human empathy.
455.449	It's both art and science.
457.295	Now, sometimes the designers
457.295	who work on these products
459.861	"are called ""data-driven,"""
461.549	which is a term that totally drives us bonkers.
464.29	The fact is, it would be irresponsible of us
467.189	not to rigorously test our designs
469.741	when so many people are counting on us
471.827	to get it right,
473.02	but data analytics
475.34	will never be a substitute for design intuition.
478.442	Data can help you make a good design great,
481.61	but it will never made a bad design good.
485.234	The next thing that you need
485.234	to understand as a principle
488.346	is that when you introduce change,
489.893	you need to do it extraordinarily carefully.
492.499	Now I often have joked that
494.166	I spend almost as much time
496.404	designing the introduction of change
498.218	as I do the change itself,
500.418	and I'm sure that we can all relate to that
502.714	when something that we use a lot changes
504.754	and then we have to adjust.
506.986	The fact is, people can become
509.19	very efficient at using bad design,
512.13	and so even if the change is
512.13	good for them in the long run,
514.802	it's still incredibly frustrating when it happens,
517.859	and this is particularly true
519.666	with user-generated content platforms,
522.362	because people can rightfully
522.362	claim a sense of ownership.
525.803	It is, after all, their content.
529.406	Now, years ago, when I was working at YouTube,
531.773	we were looking for ways to
533.968	encourage more people to rate videos,
536.244	and it was interesting because
536.244	when we looked into the data,
538.97	we found that almost everyone was exclusively using
542.429	the highest five-star rating,
544.396	a handful of people were using
545.98	the lowest one-star,
547.656	and virtually no one
549.075	was using two, three or four stars.
551.405	So we decided to simplify
553.3	into an up-down kind of voting binary model.
556.624	It's going to be much easier
556.624	for people to engage with.
559.62	But people were very attached
562.172	to the five-star rating system.
563.965	Video creators really loved their ratings.
566.396	Millions and millions of people
567.618	were accustomed to the old design.
569.781	So in order to help people
571.716	prepare themselves for change
573.42	and acclimate to the new design more quickly,
575.653	we actually published the data graph
578.116	sharing with the community
579.836	the rationale for what we were going to do,
581.984	and it even engaged the larger industry
584.605	in a conversation, which resulted in
586.07	my favorite TechCrunch headline of all time:
589.148	"""YouTube Comes to a 5-Star Realization:"
592.612	"Its Ratings Are Useless."""
595.64	Now, it's impossible to completely avoid
598.295	change aversion when you're making changes
600.795	to products that so many people use.
602.923	Even though we tried to do all the right things,
604.53	we still received our customary flood
606.763	of video protests and angry emails
609.387	and even a package that had
609.387	to be scanned by security,
613.635	but we have to remember
615.595	people care intensely about this stuff,
618.435	and it's because these products, this work,
621.373	really, really matters to them.
623.593	Now, we know that we have to be careful
626.9	about paying attention to the details,
628.89	we have to be cognizant about how we use data
631.363	in our design process,
633.035	and we have to introduce change
634.84	very, very carefully.
636.531	Now, these things are all really useful.
638.627	They're good best practices for designing at scale.
641.739	But they don't mean anything
643.531	if you don't understand something
645.203	much more fundamental.
646.865	You have to understand who you are designing for.
651.626	Now, when you set a goal to design
653.363	for the entire human race,
655.229	and you start to engage in that goal in earnest,
658.283	at some point you run into the walls
660.707	of the bubble that you're living in.
662.755	Now, in San Francisco, we get a little miffed
665.395	when we hit a dead cell zone
666.979	because we can't use our phones to navigate
668.628	to the new hipster coffee shop.
671.123	But what if you had to drive four hours
674.277	to charge your phone
675.613	because you had no reliable source of electricity?
678.854	What if you had no access to public libraries?
682.309	What if your country had no free press?
685.133	What would these products start to mean to you?
688.873	This is what Google, YouTube and Facebook
691.617	look like to most of the world,
693.336	and it's what they'll look like
694.394	to most of the next five billion people
696.496	to come online.
698.056	Designing for low-end cell phones
700.322	is not glamorous design work,
702.689	but if you want to design for the whole world,
704.601	you have to design for where people are,
706.712	and not where you are.
708.465	So how do we keep this big, big picture in mind?
711.632	We try to travel outside of our bubble to see, hear
714.716	and understand the people we're designing for.
717.291	We use our products in non-English languages
719.667	to make sure that they work just as well.
721.82	And we try to use one of these
721.82	phones from time to time
724.955	to keep in touch with their reality.
727.891	So what does it mean to design at a global scale?
732.168	It means difficult and sometimes exasperating work
735.582	to try to improve and evolve products.
739.554	Finding the audacity and the
739.554	humility to do right by them
742.747	can be pretty exhausting,
744.11	and the humility part,
745.622	it's a little tough on the design ego.
747.826	Because these products are always changing,
750.298	everything that I've designed in my career
752.81	is pretty much gone,
754.106	and everything that I will design will fade away.
757.386	But here's what remains:
759.162	the never-ending thrill
761.114	of being a part of something that is so big,
763.962	you can hardly get your head around it,
766.695	and the promise that it just might change the world.
769.592	Thank you.
771.99	(Applause)
