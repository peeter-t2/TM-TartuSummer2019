16.244	When I was little, I thought my country
16.244	was the best on the planet.
20.41	And I grew up singing a song
20.41	"called ""Nothing To Envy."""
24.244	And I was very proud.
26.34	In school, we spent a lot of time
26.34	studying the history of Kim Il-Sung,
29.889	but we never learned much
29.889	about the outside world,
34.241	except that America, South Korea,
34.241	Japan are the enemies.
39.066	Although I often wondered
39.066	about the outside world,
42.479	I thought I would spend
42.479	my entire life in North Korea,
46.143	until everything suddenly changed.
49.847	When I was seven years old,
49.847	I saw my first public execution.
54.844	But I thought my life
54.844	in North Korea was normal.
58.039	My family was not poor,
59.977	and myself, I had never
59.977	experienced hunger.
63.674	But one day, in 1995,
63.674	my mom brought home a letter
68.239	from a coworker's sister.
70.263	"It read, ""When you read this,"
73.298	our five family members
73.298	will not exist in this world,
78.154	because we haven't eaten
78.154	for the past three weeks.
82.233	We are lying on the floor together,
84.693	and our bodies are so weak,
84.693	"we are waiting to die."""
93.876	I was so shocked.
96.868	This was the first time I heard
96.868	that people in my country were suffering.
103.431	Soon after, when I was walking
103.431	past a train station,
106.284	I saw something terrible that to this day
106.284	I can't erase from my memory.
111.641	A lifeless woman was lying on the ground,
114.661	while an emaciated child in her arms
117.85	just stared helplessly
117.85	at his mother's face.
122.776	But nobody helped them,
124.682	because they were so focused on taking
124.682	care of themselves and their families.
131.281	A huge famine hit North Korea
131.281	in the mid-1990s.
135.345	Ultimately, more than a million
135.345	North Koreans died during the famine,
140.05	and many only survived by eating
140.05	grass, bugs and tree bark.
146.943	Power outages also became
146.943	more and more frequent,
150.227	so everything around me
150.227	was completely dark at night,
154.666	except for the sea of lights in China,
157.136	just across the river from my home.
159.666	I always wondered
159.666	why they had lights, but we didn't.
165.511	This is a satellite picture
165.511	showing North Korea at night,
169.26	compared to neighbors.
172.918	This is the Amnok River,
174.639	which serves as a part of the border
174.639	between North Korea and China.
179.694	As you can see, the river can be
179.694	very narrow at certain points,
183.833	allowing North Koreans to secretly cross.
188.307	But many die.
189.974	Sometimes, I saw dead bodies
189.974	floating down the river.
197.585	I can't reveal many details
197.585	about how I left North Korea,
202.387	but I only can say that
202.387	during the ugly years of the famine,
206.549	I was sent to China to live
206.549	with distant relatives.
211.75	But I only thought that I would
211.75	be separated from my family
216.267	for a short time.
217.859	I could have never imagined
219.799	that it would take 14 years
219.799	to live together.
224.298	In China, it was hard living
224.298	as a young girl without my family.
228.346	I had no idea what life
228.346	was going to be like
231.689	as a North Korean refugee.
233.736	But I soon learned it's not
233.736	only extremely difficult,
237.353	it's also very dangerous,
239.775	since North Korean refugees are considered
239.775	in China as illegal migrants.
247.422	So I was living in constant fear
247.422	that my identity could be revealed,
252.017	and I would be repatriated
252.017	to a horrible fate,
255.392	back in North Korea.
258.229	One day, my worst nightmare came true,
260.951	when I was caught by the Chinese police,
263.698	and brought to the police station
263.698	for interrogation.
267.789	Someone had accused me
267.789	of being North Korean,
271.471	so they tested my Chinese
271.471	language abilities,
274.876	and asked me tons of questions.
278.17	I was so scared.
280.612	I thought my heart was going to explode.
283.424	If anything seemed unnatural,
283.424	I could be imprisoned and repatriated.
289.257	I thought my life was over.
291.892	But I managed to control
291.892	all the emotions inside me,
294.792	and answer the questions.
297.14	After they finished questioning me,
298.922	one official said to another,
301.371	"""This was a false report."
301.371	"She's not North Korean."""
305.273	And they let me go. It was a miracle.
309.503	Some North Koreans in China
309.503	seek asylum in foreign embassies.
314.473	But many can be caught
314.473	by the Chinese police,
317.965	and repatriated.
319.711	These girls were so lucky.
321.451	Even though they were caught,
323.14	they were eventually released,
323.14	after heavy international pressure.
328.059	These North Koreans were not so lucky.
331.21	Every year, countless North Koreans
331.21	are caught in China
335.232	and repatriated to North Korea,
337.827	where they can be tortured, imprisoned,
337.827	or publicly executed.
344.037	Even though I was
344.037	really fortunate to get out,
347.141	many other North Koreans
347.141	have not been so lucky.
350.41	It's tragic that North Koreans
350.41	have to hide their identities
354	and struggle so hard just to survive.
358.194	Even after learning a new
358.194	language and getting a job,
361.232	their whole world can be turned
361.232	upside down in an instant.
365.367	That's why, after 10 years
365.367	of hiding my identity,
369.043	I decided to risk going to South Korea.
373.224	And I started a new life yet again.
376.206	Settling down in South Korea
377.818	was a lot more challenging
377.818	than I had expected.
381.591	English was so important in South Korea,
384.948	so I had to start learning
384.948	my third language.
388.694	Also, I realized there was a wide gap
388.694	between North and South.
393.281	We are all Korean, but inside,
395.458	we have become very different,
395.458	due to 67 years of division.
401.191	I even went through an identity crisis.
404.929	Am I South Korean or North Korean?
408.219	Where am I from? Who am I?
411.489	Suddenly, there was no country
411.489	I could proudly call my own.
418.977	Even though adjusting to life
418.977	in South Korea was not easy,
422.738	I made a plan -- I started studying
422.738	for the university entrance exam.
427.583	Just as I was starting
427.583	to get used to my new life,
431.345	I received a shocking phone call.
433.805	The North Korean authorities
433.805	intercepted some money
436.535	that I sent to my family,
438.194	and, as a punishment, my family
438.194	was going to be forcibly removed
443.24	to a desolate location in the countryside.
446.763	They had to get out quickly.
449.143	So I started planning
449.143	how to help them escape.
452.859	North Koreans have to travel
452.859	incredible distances
456.389	on the path to freedom.
458.929	It's almost impossible to cross the border
461.642	between North Korea and South Korea.
464.599	So, ironically, I took
464.599	a flight back to China
467.966	and headed toward the North Korean border.
472.083	Since my family couldn't speak Chinese,
474.805	I had to guide them somehow
474.805	through more than 2,000 miles
479.678	in China, and then into Southeast Asia.
484.003	The journey by bus took one week,
486.121	and we were almost caught several times.
489.461	One time, our bus was stopped
489.461	and boarded by a Chinese police officer.
496.615	He took everyone's I.D. cards,
498.386	and he started asking them questions.
501.127	Since my family couldn't
501.127	understand Chinese,
505.929	I thought my family
505.929	was going to be arrested.
509.092	As the Chinese officer
509.092	approached my family,
511.837	I impulsively stood up, and I told him
514.515	that these are deaf and dumb people
514.515	that I was chaperoning.
519.277	He looked at me suspiciously,
521.392	but luckily, he believed me.
525.275	We made it all the way
525.275	to the border of Laos.
528.881	But I had to spend almost all my money
533.252	to bribe the border guards in Laos.
536.3	But even after we got past the border,
538.611	my family was arrested and jailed
538.611	for illegal border crossing.
544.069	After I paid the fine and bribe,
546.241	my family was released in one month.
549.83	But soon after, my family
549.83	was arrested and jailed again,
553.836	in the capital of Laos.
556.828	This was one of the lowest
556.828	points in my life.
560.831	I did everything to get
560.831	my family to freedom,
566.042	and we came so close,
568.416	but my family was thrown in jail,
570.713	just a short distance
570.713	from the South Korean embassy.
574.557	I went back and forth
574.557	between the immigration office
577.337	and the police station,
579.239	desperately trying to get my family out.
582.176	but I didn't have enough money
582.176	to pay a bribe or fine anymore.
586.359	I lost all hope.
588.184	At that moment, I heard
588.184	one man's voice ask me,
591.97	"""What's wrong?"""
593.107	I was so surprised that a total stranger
593.107	cared enough to ask.
598.762	In my broken English,
598.762	and with a dictionary,
601.191	I explained the situation,
601.191	and without hesitating,
605.145	the man went to the ATM,
607.416	and he paid the rest
607.416	of the money for my family,
610.193	and two other North Koreans
610.193	to get out of jail.
614.452	I thanked him with all my heart,
614.452	and I asked him,
617.809	"""Why are you helping me?"""
620.271	"""I'm not helping you,"" he said."
622.644	"""I'm helping the North Korean people."""
625.581	I realized that this
625.581	was a symbolic moment in my life.
630.274	The kind stranger symbolized new hope
630.274	for me and the North Korean people,
635.323	when we needed it most.
637.274	And he showed me
637.274	that the kindness of strangers
640.148	and the support
640.148	of the international community
643.152	are truly the rays of hope
643.152	we North Korean people need.
648.337	Eventually, after our long journey,
650.568	my family and I were reunited
650.568	in South Korea.
654.305	But getting to freedom
654.305	is only half the battle.
657.837	Many North Koreans
657.837	are separated from their families,
661.337	and when they arrive in a new country,
663.921	they start with little or no money.
667.71	So we can benefit
667.71	from the international community
670.766	for education, English language training,
670.766	job training, and more.
676.328	We can also act as a bridge
678.169	between the people inside North Korea
678.169	and the outside world.
682.494	Because many of us stay in contact
682.494	with family members still inside,
687.789	and we send information and money
689.957	that is helping to change
689.957	North Korea from inside.
694.592	I've been so lucky, received
694.592	so much help and inspiration in my life,
699.769	so I want to help give
699.769	aspiring North Koreans
703.014	a chance to prosper
703.014	with international support.
708.821	I'm confident that you will see
708.821	more and more North Koreans
712.15	succeeding all over the world,
714.301	including the TED stage.
716.483	Thank you.
717.659	(Applause)
