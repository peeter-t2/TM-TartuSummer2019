Planetary scientist Nathalie Cabrol takes us inside the search for microbes on Mars, a hunt which counterintuitively leads us to the remote lakes of the Andes mountains. This extreme environment — with its thin atmosphere and scorched land — approximates the surface of Mars about 3.5 billion years ago. How microbes adapt to survive here may just show us where to look on Mars — and could help us understand why some microbial pathways lead to civilization while others are a dead end.	962	TED2015	Nathalie Cabrol	Nathalie Cabrol: How Mars might hold the secret to the origin of life	1	Planetary explorer	How Mars might hold the secret to the origin of life	1131041

Thousands of years before the first fully developed writing systems, our ancestors scrawled geometric signs across the walls of the caves they sheltered in. Paleoanthropologist, rock art researcher and TED Senior Fellow Genevieve von Petzinger has studied and codified these ancient markings in caves across Europe. The uniformity of her findings suggest that graphic communication, and the ability to preserve and transmit messages beyond a single moment in time, may be much older than we think.	725	TED Fellows Retreat 2015	Genevieve von Petzinger	Genevieve von Petzinger: Why are these 32 symbols found in ancient caves all over Europe?	1	Paleoanthropologist and rock art researcher	Why are these 32 symbols found in ancient caves all over Europe?	3436514

But we simply use them too much — and often for non-lifesaving purposes, like treating the flu and even raising cheaper chickens. The result, says researcher Ramanan Laxminarayan, is that the drugs will stop working for everyone, as the bacteria they target grow more and more resistant. He calls on all of us (patients and  doctors alike) to think of antibiotics -- and their ongoing effectiveness -- as a finite resource, and to think twice before we tap into it. It's a sobering look at how global medical trends can strike home.	882	TEDMED 2014	Ramanan Laxminarayan	Ramanan Laxminarayan: The coming crisis in antibiotics	1	Drug-resistance economist	The coming crisis in antibiotics	956731

In 1975, 1 in 5,000 kids was estimated to have it. Today, 1 in 68 is on the autism spectrum. What caused this steep rise? Steve Silberman points to “a perfect storm of autism awareness” — a pair of psychologists with an accepting view, an unexpected pop culture moment and a new clinical test. But to really understand, we have to go back further to an Austrian doctor by the name of Hans Asperger, who published a pioneering paper in 1944. Because it was buried in time, autism has been shrouded in misunderstanding ever since.

His conclusion: We've reversed the impact of so many diseases, says Slutkin, and we can do the same with violence.

""All that energy was pumped into the fabric of time and space itself,"" says theoretical physicist Allan Adams, ""making the universe explode in roiling waves of gravity."" About 25 years ago, a group of scientists built a giant laser detector called LIGO to search for these kinds of waves, which had been predicted but never observed. In this mind-bending talk, Adams breaks down what happened when, in September 2015, LIGO detected an unthinkably small anomaly, leading to one of the most exciting discoveries in the history of physics."	658	TED2016	Allan Adams	Allan Adams: What the discovery of gravitational waves means	1	Theoretical physicist	What the discovery of gravitational waves means	2233265

But when, in 1995, the wolves began to come back (thanks to an aggressive management program), something interesting happened: the rest of the park began to find a new, more healthful balance. In a bold thought experiment, George Monbiot imagines a wilder world in which humans work to restore the complex, lost natural food chains that once surrounded us.	910	TEDGlobal 2013	George Monbiot	George Monbiot: For more wonder, rewild the world	1	Rewilding campaigner	For more wonder, rewild the world	887823
